Science is intended to be a cumulative endeavour which is why surveying the literature is essential for any research study so new science can be built on existing knowledge. It is well documented that the amount of scientific literature being published each year is increasing, leading to increased effort being required to understand the breadth and depth of a field of interest. To address this challenge, a scientometric approach was used to evaluate explosives evidence in forensic science and identify trends, gaps, and opportunities. Analysis was carried out by examining the references contained in the triennial INTERPOL International Forensic Science Managers Symposium (IFSMS) reports and through a search for “explosive” in the Scopus citation database. 

Reference lists from citation database (Scopus) and references available in the INTERPOL reports for explosive as evidence type in forensic science are processed and compared.

The source code and the reference lists for individual analysis; to recreate the figures shown in the paper are available in this folder.
