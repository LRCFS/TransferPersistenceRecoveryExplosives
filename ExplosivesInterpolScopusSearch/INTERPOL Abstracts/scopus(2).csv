In this work, six new energetic complexes were prepared and comprehensively characterized. All energetic complexes had isostructural characteristics, which made them ideal candidates for studying their structure-performance relationships. These energetic complexes had good thermal stabilities and excellent specific impulses. The vacuum-specific impulses were in the range 264.0-271.9 s, which was greater than most reported solid hypergolic materials. Moreover, the hypergolic performance of these compounds was examined by using 100% HNO3 as the oxidizer, and their catalytic performance in the hypergolic reaction of typical energetic ionic liquids and 90% H2O2 was comprehensively studied. All compounds displayed excellent hypergolic performance with the shortest ignition delay time of 4 ms. The examined copper-containing energetic complexes displayed excellent catalytic activities for the hypergolic reaction between energetic ionic liquids and 90% H2O2. The shortest ignition delay time of the examined hypergolic reactions was 31 ms. The suitable physicochemical properties, excellent energetic properties, and high catalytic activity of the hypergolic reactions have demonstrated the great potential of these energetic complexes as promoters for the development of green hypergolic bipropellants. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85118769093"

Unusual capabilities of biological chemosensory systems, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, stimulate elaboration of the devices mimicking their activity and operation parameters as precisely as possible. The electronic analogues are a subject of investigation in many research centres, which brings their successful commercialization closer. They are believed to substitute or to complement animals in the analysis of gas substances, including explosive and hazardous ones. The limitations of classic gas sensors can be overcome using the strategies inspired by the solutions known from biological systems. Apart from high selectivity and sensitivity desired for analysis of the explosives, mimicking biological systems allows overcoming other problems connected mainly with effective sampling and odour localization. Presented review is focused on the biomimetic devices, which mimic the sense of smell in a direct way and which are the inspiration to design the devices used for detection of the explosives. Potential of biosensors and bioelectronic noses (B-ENs) to mimic the incredibly accurate and versatile “biological noses” was evaluated. A summary of the strategies inspired by biological olfactory systems should facilitate the approach to the problem of artificial instruments design and to development of the strategy aimed at analysis of the explosives with these systems. © 2021 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85106591141"

Most methods claiming to detect PBEs are indirect, actually detecting their decomposition product, H2O2. Here, we present an electrochemical sensor for direct detection of organic peroxide explosives, that is, triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylenetriperoxide diamine (HMTD), using well-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyethyleneimine (MWCNTs/PEI)-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode, namely, GC/MWCNTs/PEI electrode. This is the first use of the conductive polyelectrolyte PEI as an electrode modifier for pristine PBE sensing. The potential range, scan rate, solvent selection, and supporting electrolyte concentration were optimized for PBEs. As a distinct advantage over other similar methods, our sensor electrode responded to intact TATP solutions in neutral medium, meaning that TATP did not interact with acids/bases that would transform it into H2O2. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 10-200 mg L-1 for TATP and 25-200 mg L-1 for HMTD. Using differential pulse voltammetry, detection limits of 1.5 mg L-1 TATP and 3.0 mg L-1 HMTD were obtained from direct electrochemical reduction in 80/20% (v/v) H2O-acetone solvent medium. Electroactive camouflage materials such as passenger belongings (e.g., sweetener, detergent, sugar, and paracetamol-caffeine-based analgesic drugs), common ions, and other explosives were shown not to interfere with the proposed method. The nonresponsive behavior of our electrode to H2O2 prevents ""false positives""from other peroxide materials of everyday use. This electrochemical sensor could also detect other nitro-explosives at different potentials and was statistically validated against standard GC-MS and spectrophotometric methods.  © ","2-s2.0-85114188043"

Micro-gas chromatography (μGC) together with a micro-photoionization detector (μPID) is a prominent method for portable analysis of complex vapor mixtures, but current μPID technology demonstrates poor detection performance compared to benchtop flame ionization detectors (FIDs). This work demonstrates the development of a significantly improved μPID with a sub-picogram detection limit (as low as ∼0.2 pg) comparable to or exceeding that of a benchtop FID, with a large linear dynamic range (>4 orders of magnitude) and robustness (high stability over 200 h of plasma activation). Based on this μPID, a complete μGC-PID system was built and tested on standard sample chromatograms in a laboratory setting to show the system's analytical capabilities and the detection limit down to sub-parts per trillion concentrations (as low as 0.14 ppt). Practical in-field chromatograms on breath and car exhaust were also generated to demonstrate applicability for in situ experimentation. This work shows that μGC-PID systems can be competitive with traditional GC-FID methods and thus opens a door to rapid trace vapor analysis in the field.  © ","2-s2.0-85108120616"

In this review, the authors have focused on recent developments in these preconcentrators integrated in portable gas chromatography systems. The main materials and fabrication techniques, designs, heating technologies, fluidic connections, adsorbents, and applications are discussed.

The results of the portable GC–MS were compared to a benchtop GC–MS throughout this study. Sub-nanogram (ng) instrumental detection limits were achieved for each of the following analytes of interest (3-NT, 2,4-DNT, DPA, EC, DBP and 2-NDPA). Three different dynamic sampling methods were used with the CMV to sample and preconcentrate the volatiles prior to analysis. The headspace of a closed system was sampled over 10 min resulting in recoveries between 0.3 and 12%. Simulated open-air vapor sampling using a previously described vapor source resulted in an improvement of analyte recovery (ranging from 1.6 to 25%), for the same 10-minute sampling. A novel, continuous vapor delivery and sampling system was used, for the first time, to facilitate the delivery of sub-nanogram quantities of explosive analytes. The new continuous delivery system achieved significantly higher recoveries (3.0–89%) for all the analytes while requiring less sampling time (∼5 min) and sampling volumes than the other sampling techniques. The rapid sampling and preconcentration of sub-ng levels of VOCs in field scenarios was coupled to a ∼10-minute portable GC–MS method that compares favorably to the analytical figures of merit achieved by laboratory benchtop instruments and approximates the detection limits reported for canines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85119351344"

In this study, a simple donor (D)- acceptor (A) type small organic fluorescent triazole-based molecule (T1) is reported. T1 is composed of a central 4H-1, 2, 4-triazole (TAZ) “core” and three external triphenylamine (TPA) groups. Its spin-coating films can realize the multi-analyte fluorescent prober to detect DNT (2, 4-dinitrotoluene), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, the substitute for triacetone triperoxide (TATP)) and diethylchlorophosphate (DCP, the substitute for Sarin) vapors. Additionally, the combination of the triple sensing mechanism in the different channels affords three distinct sets of output-signal responses, these three hazardous compounds could be identified rapidly with high sensitivity and selectivity: fluorescence turn-off response to DNT, fluorescence turn-on response to H2O2 and fluorometric-colorimetric dual-channel response to DCP.

TNT is found to remain adsorbed in its molecular form on the pristine r-(110) surface; however, the presence of water and oxygen results in a degradation of TNT to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid and trinitrobenzaldehyde, while for the latter slightly lower energy barrier is required. Furthermore, the TNT adsorption is dependent on the vacancy concentration. The molecule remains adsorbed on single vacancy reduced surface, while in the presence of double vacancy, the nitro group forms a bond either with the vacant oxygen site or at the five-fold coordinated Ti-site. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85109526795"

The development of new high-energy materials with improved performance and enhanced stability is critical for promoting future military and space applications. Recently, researchers in the field of energetic materials have paid significant attention to oxadiazole-based energetic compounds, among which 1,3,4-oxadiazole demonstrates moderate energy levels and better stability, owing to the absence of readily cleaved N−O bonds compared with other oxadiazole isomers, such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 1,2,5-oxadiazole. Therefore, 1,3,4-oxadiazole is an exceptional explosophoric motif with an efficient compromise between energy and stability, and several outstanding energetic materials have been achieved based on the combination of 1,3,4-oxadiazole units with various functional groups or rings, such as polynitrobenzene, furazan, pyrazole, and 1,3,4-oxadiazole itself. This review provides an overview of the development of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based energetic materials during the past few years, outlines their synthesis and energetic performance, and contrasts them with other conventional energetic materials. Owing to the convenience of the synthetic routes and their excellent energetic properties, energetic materials based on the 1,3,4-oxadiazole skeleton may be considered as the next-generation of high-performance energetic materials specifically as heat-resistant explosives or insensitive explosives. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85107099849"

In a polymer-polymer system, we found that ultrafast Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) enhances the sensitivity of the primeval fluorescent polymer sensor by 6-fold approximately toward the conventional NACs like 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). The present article reports an optical sensor for sensitive detection of NACs by using a fluorescent probe based on FRET phenomena between P[DMA-co-(Boc-Trp-EMA)] (RP) bearing a tryptophan derivative as a donor and P[MMA-co-(Ala-HEMA)-co-(Dansyl-Ala-HEMA)] (DCP) bearing a dansyl derivative in the side chain as an acceptor. This elegant method thus paves the way to achieving a sensitivity <1 μM with a very high value of Stern-Volmer constant. Further, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved, and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy were performed to establish the quenching mechanism comprehensively. We also carried out a contact mode analysis in solid-state phase through strip tests for visual detection of NACs in ambient conditions.

Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) addresses unique terrorism-related issues relating to the mitigation, preparedness, and response measures to asymmetric, multi-modality terrorist attacks. This study is an epidemiological examination of all terrorism-related events sustained from 1970-2019, analyzing historical weapon types used and the resulting fatal injuries (FI) and non-fatal injuries (NFI) sustained. Methods: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks from 1970-2019. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria, as set by the GTD codebook. Ambiguous events were excluded. State-sponsored terrorist events do not meet the codebook's definition, and as such, are excluded from the study. Available counts of FI and NFI in each incident were then sorted and aggregated by weapon type to enable mean and standard deviation calculations. Results: In total, 168,003 events were recorded from the years 1970-2019. Explosives, bombs, and/or dynamite (E/B/D) were the most commonly used weapon type and accounted for 48.78% of all terrorism events, followed by the use of firearms in 26.77% of events. A total of 339,435 FI and 496,225 NFI resulted from all terrorism events that occurred during the study period. Combined, E/B/D and firearms accounted for 75.55% of all events, 67.1% of all FI, and 79.3% of all NFI. Each individual terrorism event inflicted a mean FI rate of 2.14 FI per event (SD = 10.2) and a mean NFI rate of 3.22 NFI per event (SD = 45.19). Conclusions: Although terrorism is complex and does not solely rely on death tolls as a measure of success, this analysis shows a historic mean FI rate of 2.14 and NFI rate of 3.22 per event over the past 50 years. Proven weapons such as E/B/D and firearms combine to account for over 75% of weapon types used in all events. Use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) such as chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons has been rare (0.2%), yet has extreme high potential to inflict mass casualties with mean NFI rates of 49.62 and 28.75 for chemical and biological weapons, respectively.  © 2021 Authors","2-s2.0-85113177161"

Colorimetric detection of analytes may occur through two independent routes: (1) nano−Fe3O4− EDA− NH2 as σ−donor may interact with the σ− and π−acceptor aromatic−poly(NO2) groups to produce a colored charge−transfer (CT) complex; (2) nano−Fe3O4−EDA−NH2 as a Fenton-type nanozyme may generate reactive species that comprise hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with H2O2 to oxidize 3,3′,5,5′–tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue-colored diimine (oxTMB−TMB) CT complex, where this color is bleached with TNT/tetryl because of donor−acceptor interactions between the explosive –NO2 groups and the –NH2 group of Fe3O4−EDA nanoparticles of restricted nanozyme activity. Both methods can quantify TNT well below the EPA recommended TNT residential screening level in soil, LOD being in the micromolar range. As EDA was covalently bound to MNPs, the same sensor can be separately reused six times for TNT and eight times for tetryl determination, using method (1). Common metal ions, anions, energetic materials, several camouflage materials, and soil components such as humates did not interfere with the nanosensor performance for TNT and tetryl. The combination of charge−transfer and nanozyme ability of Fe3O4− EDA−NH2 nanoparticles may bring a new approach to dual function colorimetric sensor design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual function colorimetric sensor for TNT and tetryl using the same nanoparticles as sensing elements in two different detection systems involving either formation or bleaching of colored species.

However, the major limitation of these AIE PNPs is the complicated synthesis and deteriorated detection accuracy because of the poor colloidal and morphological stability. This study provided a facile method to construct AIE PNPs with highly cross-linked polymer matrix for sensitive and accurate detection of nitroaromatic explosives. The highly cross-linked AIE PNPs with a ~50 nm particle size were prepared through copolymerization of divinylbenzene (DVB) and a tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based AIE luminogen, (4′-tetraphenyletheyl)pheny-3-butenylether (TPE-PBE), in a water-borne miniemulsion system. Due to the good aqueous dispersibility and highly cross-linked polymer matrix, the poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs showed excellent solvent resistance, and sensitive and accurate detection of nitroaromatic explosives in aqueous systems, especially picric acid (PA). Moreover, a rigid poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) film could preserve spherical morphology after coating poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs onto various substrates (such as filter paper and glass slide). The high surface area and loose packing of poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs offered convenience for 2,4-dinitrotoluene to diffuse and interact with TPE-PBE units. Therefore, cost-efficient and portable poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE)-coated test strips and film on glass slides exhibited fast response, strong quenching ability, and reusability in visual detection of liquid and volatile explosives, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85104435590"

The esterification process generated nitrocellulose nanofiber (NCNF) with a nitrogen content of 9.0 %–13.7 %.

To investigate the mechanism of the improvement of the energy of host–guest explosives by guest molecules, ReaxFF-lg reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the thermal decomposition reactions of the host–guest explosives systems ICM-102/HNO3, ICM-102/H2O2, and pure ICM-102 under different constant high temperatures and different heating rates. Incorporation of guest molecules significantly increased the energy level of the host–guest system. However, the initial reaction path of the ICM-102 molecule was not changed by the guest molecules. The guest molecules did not initially participate in the host molecule reaction. After a period of time, the H2O2 and HNO3 guest molecules promoted cleavage of the C–N bond of the ICM-102 ring. Stronger oxidation and higher oxygen content resulted in the guest molecules more obviously accelerating destruction of the ICM-102 ring structure. The guest molecules accelerated the initial endothermic reaction of ICM-102, but they played a more important role in the intermediate exothermic reaction stage: incorporation of guest molecules (HNO3 and H2O2) greatly improved the heat release and exothermic reaction rate.

Realistic explosion scenarios often involve the detonation of non-spherical high explosive charges, rather than the idealised spherical/hemispherical explosives assumed in commonly employed semi-empirical approaches. Additionally, near-field effects are of great importance when assessing structural damage and injury risk from such an event. There is a need, therefore, to incorporate the effects of charge shape and the resulting loading distribution in simplified engineering-level tools using adjustments based on sound physical principles. This article details the development of an energy equivalent formulation to derive spherical equivalence factors, with the methodology illustrated for the scenario of a centrally detonated cylindrical explosive charge. A validated two-part numerical model is used to generate specific impulse distributions and quantify the resulting plate deformation, for a wide range of cylindrical aspect ratios (0.20≤L/D≤5), at a range of near-field scaled distances (0.108≤Z≤0.485 m/kg1/3) for different sized structural targets. A series of verification examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the method, with the peak deflection under the equivalent spherical charge matching peak deflection under the cylindrical charge to within ∼4%.

Furthermore, based on the advantages of the rapid and simple preparation of the MCS, the suitable polymer-coated explosive composite system can be quickly screened out. Four typical binders were selected by the MCS to coat the nano-hexanitrostilbene (nano- HNS), and their properties were analyzed. On this basis, the surface modification and coating mechanism of the binder on HNS crystals and the effect of micro mixing conditions on PBXs crystal growth were studied.

The thermal and mechanical properties of these materials must be well-understood so that appropriate engineering models can be developed, but testing such properties under many scenarios can be hazardous and expensive. A non-hazardous PBX surrogate (“mock”) may be used in place of a PBX in many experiments if the thermomechanical properties are well-matched. Our previous research has shown that 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IDOX) is a promising crystalline filler material for the explosive cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX). Here, we investigate how the binder composition, variations in the IDOX particle size distribution, and pressing temperature affect the compressive strength and elastic modulus. We observe that while the binder system used in the composite dominates the mechanical response, the particle size distribution and pressing conditions do have a measurable effect on the material compliance and strength. © 2021","2-s2.0-85108974068"

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis suggests that the copper ferrite with the spinel-type ferrite crystal forms have been successfully prepared. More crystal defects are observed in copper ferrite crystals than in the pure iron oxide and copper oxide crystals. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analyses reveal that the prepared copper ferrites are mesoporous structures with large specific surface areas and the specific surface area increases with the increase of Fe content. The effects of the structure of copper ferrite on its catalytic activity for the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and the catalytic mechanism were investigated and explored based on the thermogravimetric analysis of the decomposition process. It is found that the copper ferrites prepared at the molar ratios of Cu/Fe of 1/2 and 1/4 exhibit the best catalytic activities for the thermal decomposition of AP. The synergistic catalytic mechanism of Cu–Fe–O is proposed based on the electron transfer and proton transfer theories for the thermal decomposition of AP.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing provides a feasible and effective way to fabricate propellants according to interior ballistic requirements. The main objective of this paper is to improve the properties of 3D printed propellants in terms of energy content and combustion behavior. Three propellant formulas, which contain polyurethane-acrylic acid resin as binder and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) as energetic filler, were fabricated by extrusion material 3D printing. The formulas with the force constant of 1107.43–1209.44 J/g were designed. The combustion behaviors of designed formulas, such as the maximum pressure, burn time, and burn rate, were characterized by closed bomb tests.

Therefore, in this review, the recent progress of different photothermal materials and their laser-induced performances have been summarized. First, an overview of optical ignition, especially laser ignition, including the main categories, mechanisms, advantages, and applications, was introduced. Then, different photothermal materials, including carbon-based materials, composite materials, explosives, and gaseous mixtures, were summarized, and their photothermal performances were listed and compared.

In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted PBX compaction technique and equipment were introduced and designed. With this equipment, it is found that the density of compacted PBX parts increases, and the diameter expansion and density differences decrease by applying ultrasonic vibration. The influences of compaction pressure, hold time and particle size on the compaction were also analyzed. The results indicate that increasing the pressure and time, while decreasing the particle size, results in a higher density and strength of PBX parts. Then, the microstructures were analyzed to show the mechanism of density distributions. It is found that the density increase is due to the particle's rearrangement leading to a “dense” structure and smaller particle sizes with ultrasonic vibration. Finally, the compressive modulus and strength, and the tensile fracture and strength were found to increase by applying ultrasonic vibration. These mechanical properties decrease along the radial and axial direction, indicating the surface effect of the ultrasonic vibration. © 2021","2-s2.0-85108109557"

C-dots exhibited a strong blue photoluminescence (26.8% quantum yield) with excitation-dependent properties and good stabilities against pH (6–12), salts and metal ions. Furthermore, C-dots were successfully developed for TNP sensing based on fluorescence quenching in water solution with high selectivity and sensitivity, and the detection limit was as low as 58.5 nM. The unchanged fluorescence lifetimes of C-dots suggested that luminescent quenching effect was predominantly caused by inner-filter effect (IFE).

The phase, morphology and optical properties were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy respectively. Herein, the as-synthesized nanophosphor was functionalized with amine rich polyethylenimine (PEI) resulting in development of a luminescent nanoprobe bearing dual sensing functions for hazardous nitroaromatics and heavy metal ions. The strong photoluminescence emission of Eu3+ions was selectively quenched upon addition of toxic analytes at concentrations from 10 to 100 ppm due to complex formation between the analytes and PEI functionalized nanostructure. The synthesized nanomaterial shows sharp emission peaks at 493, 594, 624, 657 and 700 nm. Significantly, the peak at 594 nm shows a noticeable quenching effect on addition of toxic analytes to the aqueous solution of the nanocrystals. The nanophosphors are sensitive and efficient for the PA and Fe3+ion detection with an LOD of 1.32 ppm and 1.39 ppm. The Stern-Volmer (SV) quenching constant (KSV) is found to be 2.25 × 105M−1for PA and 3.8 × 104M−1for Fe3+ions. The highKSVvalue and low LOD suggest high selectivity and sensitivity of the nanosensor towards PA and Fe3+ions over other analytes.

Both of the polymeric compounds show extensive hydrogen bonding and π···πstacking interactions to form three-dimensional (3D) structures. The presence of geometrically suitable proximal anthracene moieties (extended π-conjugation) in both the compounds provides feasible interacting sites for incoming analytes that also explains their prompt sensing property. Interestingly, both the fluorescent sensing probes exhibit highly efficient ratiometric and selective sensing ability toward TNP with fast response over other comparative epNACs. A detailed investigation on the mechanistic pathways for the quenching response has been obtained by density functional theory calculation. The results show higher sensitivity of 2 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.45 μM as compared to 1 (LOD ∼0.51 μM). To the best of our knowledge, such hitherto unknown CPs acting as highly fluorescent sensors are not known in the literature.

Firstly, the heat of the explosion was measured and two formulations were selected as the investigated samples. Next the thermal stability was studied by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) and thermal cook-off tests. Then the impact and friction sensitivity were measured, and finally the detonation performance was characterized by cylinder tests and particle velocity measurements of the detonation reaction zone.

For this, in turn, one needs to find the reaction enthalpies of the essential NC decomposition reactions and the stabilizer reactions at the temperature of the measurement of the heat flow.

To get meaningful data it was necessary to use quantum mechanical calculations, here so-called DFT (density functional theory) methods, to screen the possible reactions by transition states and the energetic situation between educts and products.

The resuspension thresholds are correlated to the boundary layer properties, i.e., wall shear stresses (τw = 50–500Pa). These rates are then compared to contact sampling for five commercial swabs using a standardized swabbing method. LC-MS analysis is used for the quantification of particle removal efficiencies. Contact sampling has an advantage over the low shear stress cases for particle liberation from the smooth surfaces. Aerodynamic particle resuspension rates increase with the wall shear stress. It shows better results for rough and fibrous surfaces than contact removal for tested analytes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85103972458"

Existing analytical instruments and methods for identifying these substances are constrained by sensitivity, speed, and portability because of inherent technical defects. Miniaturized photoionization ion trap mass spectrometry is suitable for rapid and on-site identification of illegal drugs and the explosives; however, tandem mass spectrometry and the fragment ions have not been fully investigated. In this article, the abundant fragments of 22 illegal drugs and seven explosives were analyzed successfully using resonance excitation with a miniaturized ion trap mass spectrometer constructed in our laboratory and coupled with flash-thermal-desorption acetone-assisted photoionization. The mass range of the rectilinear ion trap was optimized through experimental mapping of stability diagrams to decrease the effect of the low mass cut-off. The secular frequencies for resonance excitation were simulated and validated using the experimental results. The fragments of illegal drugs and explosives were investigated and imported into a database. By comparing the tandem mass spectrometry fragments and the created database, a seized analyte could be identified within 3 s using a single analysis. This work indicates that ion resonance excitation is an effective approach for rapid analysis of illegal drugs and explosives. Furthermore, combination of a miniaturized ion trap mass spectrometer and compound database is useful for the identification of unknown and known compounds in forensic screening applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85107145102"

Load, assembly and packing (LAP) facilities that process munitions produce wastewater contaminated with IHE which must be treated before discharge. Some facilities can produce as much as 90,000 L of contaminated wastewater per day. In this review, methods of wastewater treatment are assessed in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for their use in production of IHE munitions including their limitations and how they could be applied to industrial scale LAP facilities.

Herein, we report the fabrication of interconnected Ag nanostructures on the unmodified filter paper-based flexible substrates by a facile recipe, which involves evaporation of Ag precursor solution on the filter paper followed by its reduction with a strong reducing agent, NaBH4. The fabrication process is time-efficient, reproducible, and has the potential of being scaled up. The presence of inter-connected nanostructures results in high concentration of uniformly distributed hotspots on the substrate, which in turn provide excellent and reproducible SERS sensitivity. The finite element simulation results showed that fabricated nanostructures are much more effective for field enhancement as compared to the agglomerated spherical nanoparticles. Crystal violet (CV) concentration of 10−8 M was easily detected with these substrates both via solution drying and swabbing. Similarly, AgFPS have proven effective for swab-based detection of urea nitrate (UN), a well-known constituent of homemade explosives. The C-N and NO3- symmetric stretching modes of UN are detectable down to 1 µM and 100 µM concentrations, respectively. Moreover, these substrates showed SERS signal uniformity both from different spots of a single substrate, and substrates from different batches, with spot-to-spot relative standard deviation (RSD) of 15% and sample-to-sample RSD of 15–19%. This makes them excellent for reliable and quick quantitative detection.

The changes in soil enzyme activity and microbial community structure and function were analyzed in soil, and the effects of explosives exposure on the soil metabolic spectrum were revealed by non-targeted metabonomics. TNT, RDX, and HMX exposure significantly inhibited soil microbial respiration and urease and dehydrogenase activities. Explosives treatment reduced the diversity and richness of the soil microbial community structure, and the microorganisms able to degrade explosives began to occupy the soil niche, with the Sphingomonadaceae, Actinobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria showing significantly increased relative abundances.

Furthermore, a continuous microfluidic platform was established for the verification experiments, which is consisting of a combinatorial microfluidic module and a spray-drying module. Here we used HNS (2,2′,4,4′,6,6′hexanitrostilbene) to verify the applicability of the strategy. The spheroidization process was verified by deconstructing HNS microspheres and adjusting the internal-outside pressure at the microscale. The spheroidization types were verified by tuning flow rate ratios of the solvent and antisolvent. It was found that the model is quite applicable for the spheroidization of micro/nano hierarchical structure by microfluidics. According to the detonation test, it was found the HNS microspheres have similar firing sensitivity to nano HNS under short-pulse shock wave, which means the better fluidity and higher bulk density can be realized while retaining the firing sensitivity.

Once TNT or TATP is physisorbed on C/BN heteronanotubes, new resonances are formed within the energy gap of heteronanotubes. Crucially, transport resonances associated with TNT are formed above the Fermi level and are due to nitro group whereas TATP resonances happen to be below the Fermi level. Consequently, a negative Seebeck coefficient is expected for C/BN heteronanotubes devices in the presence of TNT in contrast to a positive Seebeck coefficient in the presence of TATP.

Analyses of spatial and temporal meshes revealed that numerical results were independent of the grid used. Predictions show that the ignition procedure affects the formation of the reaction-front, higher temperatures, and longer ignition zones can start the self-sustained reaction earlier. However, once the reaction wave is established, its velocity and peak temperature are the same, independent of the initial temperature profile.

An uncontrolled fire in an adjacent warehouse ignited ~2,750 tons of Ammonium Nitrate (AN), producing one of the most devastating blasts in recent history. The blast supersonic pressure and heat wave claimed the lives of 220 people and injured more than 6,500 instantaneously, with severe damage to the nearby dense residential and commercial areas. This review represents one of the in-depth reports to provide a detailed analysis of the Beirut blast and its health and environmental implications. It further reviews prior AN incidents and suggests actionable recommendations and strategies to optimize chemical safety measures, improve emergency preparedness, and mitigate the delayed clinical effects of blast and toxic gas exposures. These recommended actionable steps offer a starting point for government officials and policymakers to build frameworks, adopt regulations, and implement chemical safety protocols to ensure safe storage of hazardous materials as well as reorganizing healthcare system disaster preparedness to improve emergency preparedness in response to similar large-scale disasters and promote population safety. Future clinical efforts should involve detailed assessment of physical injuries sustained by blast victims, with systemic mitigation and possible treatment of late blast effects involving individuals, communities and the region at large. © Copyright © 2021 Al-Hajj, Dhaini, Mondello, Kaafarani, Kobeissy and DePalma.","2-s2.0-85108345552"

Previously, a hollow cathode discharge (HCD) ion source has been fabricated for detection of explosives. Recently, the HCD ion source has been modified for a dual pressures operating system and coupled to a linear ion trap MS to analyze explosives simultaneously. Here, trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerin (NG), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were taken as model explosive compounds and the mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode ionization. At the higher ion source pressure (~28.0–30.0 Torr), NG, PETN and RDX gave adduct ions with the NO3− ion while TNT showed the [TNT + NO3–HNO2]- (m/z 242) simultaneously. However, NG and PETN did not give any ion signals at the lower ion source pressure (~0.8–1.0 Torr) while TNT exhibited its molecular ion, [TNT]-• (m/z 227), as a major ion through electron attachment and RDX showed fragment ions that followed electron capture dissociation concurrently. The modified HCD ion source exhibited better sensitivity in simultaneous detection and quantification of the explosives. The NO3− and NO2− as reagent ions in the air HCD plasma form stable adduct ions with the NG, PETN and RDX even with TNT at the higher temperature (140–200 °C). The formation of the NO3−, NO2− in the HCD plasma also causes the formation of [TNT-H]- (m/z 226) at the higher ion source pressure. The inner metallic surface of the hollow tube assists the Birch reduction type reaction that results in the formation of hydride ion of the TNT, [TNT + H]- (m/z 228). No significant difference in the spectral pattern for simultaneous and individual measurements for the explosives was observed at the higher ion source pressure. Therefore, it may conclude that the present modified HCD ion source can be used for simultaneous detection and quantification of the explosive compounds at trace and/or ultra-trace levels using air as a carrier gas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85107779948"

Gas-phase decomposition products are identified by IR absorption spectroscopy. The frequency shifts in rovibrational spectra due to isotopic substitution and the change in rate of formation of decomposition products due to the kinetic-isotope-effect (KIE) help elucidate the decomposition pathways. The formation of H2O precedes other molecules (e. g., HCN, HNCO) during decomposition. After the concentrations of HCN and HNCO molecules reach a peak, their amounts gradually decrease. The concentrations of the other decomposition products (e. g., NH3 and CO2) rapidly rise after an induction period, which is attributed to the presence of autocatalytic reactions. The trends of chemical evolution are similar for all the samples, but their kinetic behaviors are different. This indicates the rates of consistent pathways are changed during thermal decomposition. The kinetics of deuterated TATB decomposition is slower than that of unsubstituted TATB due to the KIE (kH/kD∼1.41). The rate of LX-17 decomposition is slightly lower than unsubstituted TATB (kTATB/kLX-17∼1.15). The KIE is more pronounced during the early stage of decomposition, which is attributed to the first steps of TATB decomposition involving water formation (i. e., H vs D transfer). The KIE slows down the formation of all gases, including those lacking hydrogen (e. g., CO2). These results suggest the TATB thermal decomposition mechanism might involve a series of pathways rather than a set of independent and parallel reactions. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85107757481"

This work reports the synthesis of a solid-state plasmonic sensor based on a nanocomposite of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective detection of 3-NT, an explosive taggant for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. In our approach, the in situ synthesis of Ag NPs and the molecular imprinting with 3-NT as a template take place simultaneously inside the polyethyleneimine (PEI) thin film during the baking step after spin coating. The MIP sensor fabrication is done by a low-cost, fast, and scalable one-step procedure. We demonstrate the chemosensing capabilities of Ag-PEI MIP nanocomposites to 3-NT using the localized surface plasmon resonance band intensity decay as a sensing parameter. The molecular imprinting approach results in an enhancement of specific sensor response to 3-NT, with a limit of detection of 54.8 ng for 3-NT and a sensitivity of 24.0% ± 3.0%. We tested the MIP sensor specificity by comparing the sensor response to several NO2-containing molecules. The Ag-PEI MIP sensor demonstrated a robust, specific molecular recognition toward 3-NT. Because the MIP nanocomposite sensor is easy to prepare, easy to use, and inexpensive, these plasmonic sensors can be easily implemented with portable reading platforms into remote explosive detection and bomb disposal robots.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

As there are no acceptable methodologies for the remote discovery of such devices, current detection practices still require the risky presence of personnel in the minefield. We have recently described bacterial sensor strains capable of reporting the existence of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) vapors in the soil above 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-based landmines, by generating a bioluminescent or a fluorescent signal. This may allow the identification of landmine location by remote imaging of an area over which the bacteria have been spread. In the study reported herein, we have improved the DNT-detection capabilities of these sensor strains by combining two DNT-responsive Escherichia coli gene promoters, yqjF and azoR, and subjecting them to three cycles of random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, combined with segmentation and rearrangement (“DNA shuffling”). The activity of selected modified promoters was evaluated with the Aliivibrio fischeri and Photobacterium leiognathi luxCDABEG gene cassettes as the bioluminescent reporters, exhibiting a ten-fold background reduction that has led to a three-fold decrease in detection threshold. Signal intensity was further enhanced by modifying the ribosomal binding site of the yqjF gene promoter. The superior DNT detection capabilities on a solid matrix by the improved sensor strain were demonstrated. Key points: • Performance of microbial sensor strains for buried explosives was molecularly enhanced. • Manipulations included random mutagenesis, “DNA shuffling,” and RBS reprogramming. • The re-engineered constructs exhibited superior detection of trace explosives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85105411582"

An extensive consequence analysis based on the crater size and physical effects for the estimation of the quantity of exploded ammonium nitrate was performed. By using satellite images and integration methods, the crater diameter was determined to be 112.9 m. From the scaling laws, overpressure effect on structures, and inverse analysis, the trinitrotoluene equivalent mass of exploded ammonium nitrate was approximately 950.3 tons.

The results compare dissipation from the source to the instrument (in minutes), steady state signal intensity (i.e. approximate relative amounts), and dissipation of the odor after removing the source (also in minutes). Several parameters were tested: reproducibility between POCRs, TATP versus TATP with a lid (containing 13 drilled holes), distance from the detector, heights of the source, concealment, purposeful air disturbances, blanks, and containment systems. In general, the PDMS-based training aid behaved similarly to the TATP with a 13-hole lid, which is the aid most often used by the FBI's National Canine Improvised Explosives Detection Program. Results shows that the PDMS-based training aids are reproducible and reliable at steady state as a vapor release system. As expected, signal was decreased given increased distance from the DART interface for all sample types, when using the odor-restricting lid with the 1 g TATP sample, when all samples were placed at height, and when using a cotton bag as a method of concealment. Despite having no direct correlation, these results support anecdotal canine evidence since canine handlers tend to report that their dogs have more difficulty finding training aids within those same parameters. Further, adding purposeful air disturbances had a larger effect on signal intensity for 1 g TATP than on the PDMS-based training aid. Finally, adding a masking odor at the DART interface decreased detection of TATP regardless of the vapor source, but did not fully diminish it. This too agrees with canine handler reports and previous research, where dogs may have a more difficult time locating odors in the presence of high background. This is the first report of its kind to use real-time detection to characterize vapor release and dissipation from a biosensor training aid in comparison to the corresponding true material it intends to replace. By using the three phases of odor release (saturation, steady state, and depletion), the study investigates the effects of several ambient parameters on TATP volatile detection from true material and the PDMS-based training aid. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85101097804"

Using partial least squares as the multivariate calibration method, quantitative calibration models for components in X were verified internally and externally. The possible combinations of eight general spectral pretreatment methods and different bands of the scanning spectral region (12,500-4000 cm-1) were established. The models were analyzed, evaluated, and optimized via the fitting effect. The data were combined with the mathematical meaning of the model spectral pretreatment methods and the chemical significance of the modeling spectral bands. Prediction performance offered optimal quantitative calibration models. Paired bilateral Student's t tests show that there is no significant difference between the values obtained by NIR and chemical analysis methods, and the NIR method has good accuracy.

Copper azide (CA), one of the most promising primary explosives, is restricted in practical applications because of its high electrostatic sensitivity and the method of charge in micro-initiation systems. To tackle these issues, two synthetic paths of CA based on a porous graphene skeleton are proposed. First, a viscous homogeneous mixed solution is rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen to form a spherical copper-containing precursor material. The copper azide/carbon/graphene composite (CA/C/GA) was fabricated by freeze-drying, high-temperature thermal decomposition and in situ azidation. Second, A cylindrical copper/graphene gel formed by high-temperature hydrothermal self-assembly is served as a precursor material. Also, hydrogen reduction and in situ azidation procedures were utilized to synthesize copper azide@graphene foam (CA@GF). Detailed characterization indicates that the excellent performance of composite materials is ascribed to the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene material. The electrostatic sensitivities of CA/C/GA and CA@GF were 3.6 mJ and 2.5 mJ, respectively, and the flame sensitivity was 50 cm. The course of fabrication is environmentally friendly and easy to perform and it may be well-matched with the charge of the micro-detonation system.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-85109829318"

The core-shell structure and the composition of energetic crystal@CNF were examined through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The obtained outcomes demonstrated that the dispersibility of the CNF enhanced favorably upon covering the surface of explosive crystals; the interfacial contact ability between CNFs and energetic crystals was also manifested to be increased, which could be ascribed to the interfacial interaction of hydrogen bonds and the electrostatic force of self-assembly. In addition, the stable crystalloid construction of β-HMX and ϵ-CL-20 has been preserved positively in the preparation process. In comparison with raw explosives, the thermal stability and sensitivity performances of the core-shell structure composites were outstanding.

Light-driven semiconductor-based micromotors are especially appealing, as they can split surrounding water via light irradiation, and therefore, they can move infinitely. However, their motion is typically limited to in-plane motion with four degrees of freedom (4DoF) or even pseudo-1D motion with 2DoF. Herein, magnetically steerable tubular TiO2/Fe3O4/CdS micromotors, termed microsubmarines, with 6DoF motion, based on a fuel-free design where surrounding water acts as fuel upon visible light irradiation, are presented, with an average velocity of 7.9 µm s−1. Besides, the generation of radicals via such water splitting aids the photocatalytic chemicals degradation with the potential to use solar radiation. A light-induced self-electrophoretic mechanism is responsible for the self-propulsion and can be used to predict the motion direction based on the structure and composition. Finally, the TiO2/Fe3O4/CdS microsubmarines are tested in a proof-of-concept application of high-energy explosive, e.g., picric acid, photocatalytic degradation, with the best performance owing to the versatility of 6DoF motion, the surface coating with amorphous TiO2 layer, and UV light.

By using an elevated temperature for the target explosive, the amount of vapor is enhanced, increasing the production of the characteristic odor profile. The polymeric adsorbent is maintained at a cool temperature, favoring vapor capture.

Whatever its form or complexity, the detonation performance model must be able to accurately capture the detonation wave timing and the energy release that it triggers upon arrival. Specifically, the HE products equation-of-state (EOS), which largely determines the detonating HE's ability to do useful work on its surroundings, is typically inferred from cylinder expansion tests where metal-confined HE cylinders are detonated and the ensuing outer confiner wall-expansion trajectory is recorded. Expensive, iterative comparisons to multimaterial hydrodynamic (or ""hydrocode"") simulations of these experiments are then used to constrain the parameters of the chosen EOS form.

The handling sensitivity of explosives is controlled by factors that span from fundamental intramolecular effects to mesoscale structure and defects. Although the drop-weight impact test has been used to characterize energetic material sensitivity for over 50 years, there is still very limited understanding on which features of explosives influence or control impact sensitivity. Fundamental chemistry is likely the most important player in handling sensitivity of energetics, however secondary effects such as particle size and morphology are thought to influence the results in impact sensitivity tests. We have recently discovered that batches of trinitrotoluene (TNT) obtained with a freshly synthesized method versus a historical lot sample exhibit significantly different impact sensitivity values. To determine if differences in particle size were the reason for the different results, in the present work we have prepared 13 different samples of TNT and tested each for particle size and impact sensitivity. Though the particle sizes of the samples range from 44 - 1502 µm, impact test values fall mostly within error, given the large standard deviation in the test. The historical lot TNT sample is an exception, and is more sensitive than the newly prepared batches. Overall, more work is needed to determine if other factors such as purity and particle morphology (rather than size) are more important for influencing impact test results in TNT. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Therefore, MS technique has widely been used in all branches of chemistry along with in proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, lipidomics, environmental monitoring etc. Mass spectrometry-based methods are very much needed for fast and reliable detection and quantification of drugs of abuse and explosives in order to provide fingerprint information for criminal investigation as well as for public security and safety at public places, respectively. Most of the compounds exist as their neutral form in nature except proteins, peptides, nucleic acids that are in ionic forms intrinsically. In MS, ion source is the heart of the MS that is used for ionizing the electrically neutral molecules. Performance of MS in terms of sensitivity and selectivity depends mainly on the efficiency of the ionization source. Accordingly, much attention has been paid to develop efficient ion sources for a wide range of compounds. Unfortunately, none of the commercial ion sources can be used for ionization of different types of compounds. Moreover, in MS, analyte molecules must be released into the gaseous phase and then ionize by using a suitable ion source for detection/quantification.

A series of analytical and test methods were systematically conducted to characterize the structure, composition, thermal properties, and safety performance of the materials. The results indicated that the particles of nitramine explosives were dispersed and embedded homogeneously in the three-dimensional (3D) porous cross-linked construction of the NBC gel matrix; the crystal growth of the explosive particles was restricted, which led to nanometer-scale composites. The thermal analysis demonstrated that the peak temperature of the composite (e.g., NBC/CL-20: 224.8 °C) was reduced and produced substantial heat release (e.g., NBC/CL-20: 3346 J·g-1) during the process of decomposition. In addition, the mechanism of thermal decomposition was probed, and cyclic catalytic decomposition between the NBC gel and explosives may exist. The sensitivity decreased visibly because of the existence of the cross-linked structure of the gel matrix, which could act as a buffer system to mitigate the release stimulated from the surroundings. Accordingly, this investigation may provide the promising potential for NBC-based energetic composites used in explosives and propellants in the military, and further promote the methodology for manufacturing energetic nanocomposites.  © ","2-s2.0-85101746968"

Drop-weight impact tests, which represent explosive material sensitivity with the drop height required for a sample to react with 50% probability, are the most common method for understanding and quantifying explosive sensitivity. However, results from impact tests are influenced not only by the explosive material tested but also by the testing conditions and experimental setup. Examples of these testing conditions are the laboratory where the test was performed, the methods for choosing drop height levels and computing sensitivity, and whether grit paper was used to promote the initiation of reactions. We compile a historical data set with over 450 impact test results of the explosive standard pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) from 1959 to 2020. We model the sensitivity of PETN as a function of the test laboratory, the test method, and the use of grit paper and find that all have a significant effect on the measured sensitivity of PETN.

Its ignition and combustion processes are fairly complex and need to be better understood. In this study, the thermal decomposition, ignition, and combustion properties of an Al/AP/HTPB propellant were investigated using a thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry and a laser ignition testing system. The morphology and size distribution of the condensed combustion products (CCPs) were analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the thermal decomposition process of the propellant consisted of three stages. The first stage (100–430 °C) was a major mass loss stage and exhibited typical features of AP decomposition. The second stage (430–630 °C) was mainly accompanied by the decomposition of remaining HTPB as well as slight oxidation of Al particles. In the third stage, further oxidation of Al particles resulted in a small mass increase. Due to the continuous emission problem, only a few combustion intermediates were identified in the combustion emission spectrum curves. The propellant combustion process could be roughly divided into three stages, and the flame development stage lasted longer than the flame decline stage. As the pressure increased, the propellant ignition delay time decreased and the burning rate increased significantly. The effect of pressure on ignition delay was more pronounced at low pressures. The CCPs consisted of three types. The oxidation of Al particles in the propellant followed the diffusion reaction mechanism. Agglomerates appeared in several different morphologies and had relatively low combustion efficiency under experimental conditions.

In quantifying vapor content emanating from low-volatility explosives, we observed discrepancies between the quantity of explosive expected based on literature vapor pressure values and the amount detected near ambient temperatures. Most vapor pressure measurements for low-volatility explosives, such as RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane) and HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), have been made at temperatures far exceeding 25 °C and linear extrapolation of these higher temperature trends appears to underestimate vapor pressures near room temperature. Our goal was to measure vapor pressures as a function of temperature closer to ambient conditions. We used saturated RDX and HMX vapor sources at controlled temperatures to produce vapors that were then collected and analyzed via atmospheric flow tube-mass spectrometry (AFT-MS). The parts-per-quadrillion (ppqv) sensitivity of AFT-MS enabled measurement of RDX vapor pressures at temperatures as low as 7 °C and HMX vapor pressures at temperatures as low as 40 °C for the first time. Furthermore, these vapor pressures were corroborated with analysis of vapor generated by nebulizing low concentration solutions of RDX and HMX. We report updated vapor pressure values for both RDX and HMX.

Subsequently, the SP was coupled to the poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) block through DCC coupling. The structural and physicochemical properties of the (co)polymer were studied to explore its potential towards the detection of nitroaromatics as a model for explosives. A systematic comparison is made on the chemosensing behavior of the (co)polymer and three small molecule pyrazoloanthrone analogues with different functional groups (SP, SP-OH and SP-COOH).

Electron and spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the modification of the FL-MnO2 NSs (named as PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs) with amine-rich polyethyleneimine (PEI) produced planar, β-phase, well-crystalline, and positively charged nanosheets. This PEI-related surface modification not only improves the quantum yield of the FL-MnO2 NSs from 7.6 to 13.2% but also provides multiple binding sites with nitro groups of NAs. It was found that the presence of TNT, as an example of NAs, efficiently quenched the fluorescence of the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs due to the formation of Meisenheimer complexes through the efficient adsorption process. In comparison to PEI-modified MnO2 quantum dots, the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs exhibited relatively high sensitivity to TNT with a limit of detection of 20 pM. By depositing PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs on a filter paper, the as-made paper sensor was capable of visualizing 10 nM TNT in drinking water and 10 μM TNT on a postal envelope through the appearance of a quenching spot under a UV lamp. Besides, the adsorbed PEI polymer enables the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs to electrostatically interact with citrate-capped metal nanoparticles, producing the composites for catalyzing NaBH4-mediated reduction of NAs. Since the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs possess a large surface area to capture NAs and serve as an electron acceptor for BH4-, the formed composites efficiently catalyze the reaction of NaBH4 and NAs as compared to metal nanoparticles and PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs alone.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85099966187"

However, the near-detonation zone effects of reaction between Nano-Al with detonation products remain unclear. In this study, the overall reaction process of 170 nm Al with RDX explosive and its effect on detonation characteristics, detonation reaction zone, and the metal acceleration ability were comprehensively investigated through a variety of experiments such as the detonation velocity test, detonation pressure test, explosive/window interface velocity test and confined plate push test using high-resolution laser interferometry. Lithium fluoride (LiF), which has an inert behavior during the explosion, was used as a control to compare the contribution of the reaction of aluminum. A thermochemical approach that took into account the reactivity of aluminum and ensuing detonation products was adopted to calculate the additional energy release by afterburn. Combining the numerical simulations based on the calculated afterburn energy and experimental results, the parameters in the detonation equation of state describing the Nano-Al reaction characteristics were calibrated. This study found that when the 170 nm Al content is from 0% to 15%, every 5% increase of aluminum resulted in about a 1.3% decrease in detonation velocity. Manganin pressure gauge measurement showed no significant enhancement in detonation pressure. The detonation reaction time and reaction zone length of RDX/Al/wax/80/15/5 explosive is 64 ns and 0.47 mm, which is respectively 14% and 8% higher than that of RDX/wax/95/5 explosive (57 ns and 0.39 mm). Explosive/window interface velocity curves show that 170 nm Al mainly reacted with the RDX detonation products after the detonation front. For the recording time of about 10 μs throughout the plate push test duration, the maximum plate velocity and plate acceleration time accelerated by RDX/Al/wax/80/15/5 explosive is 12% and 2.9 μs higher than that of RDX/LiF/wax/80/15/5, respectively, indicating that the aluminum reaction energy significantly increased the metal acceleration time and ability of the explosive.

The detonation of these high-energy materials should be initiated by a desired and expected external energy; however, unintentional initiation occurs owing to internal voids inside the high explosives, referred to as hotspots. To address this issue, in this study, one of the representative HEs, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), was confined in nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface areas and high pore volumes to decrease the hotspots and provide a rigid shield. The RDX-encapsulated mesoporous MOF (pore volume of 1.4 cm3/g) showed lower impact sensitivity (23%) and friction sensitivity (125%) compared to those of the non-encapsulated RDX, owing to the decrease in hotspots due to the nano-sizing of the HE and protection from external impact provided by the rigid MOF structure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85097670501"

Rigby et al. (Shock Waves 30:671–675, 2020) used observations from numerous video recordings of the explosion to estimate the time-of-arrival of the primary shock at 38 positions, the distances of which from the centre of the explosion were determined from Google maps. These data were analysed to make a preliminary estimate of the TNT equivalence of the explosion, with a best estimate of 0.5 kt and an upper limit of 1.12 kt. Rigby et al. have made their data available for other users, and the present paper describes how these data have been further analysed to obtain the TNT and ANFO equivalences as functions of radial distances from the centre of the explosion. The TNT equivalence varies from 0.15 to 0.7 kt, with a median value of about 0.5 kt, in agreement with the Rigby et al. result.

The relevant compounds were deposited on the ultrasonic blade except pharmaceutical tablets that were used directly, and gently touched on perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) made substrate with oscillation frequency about 40 kHz in order to desorb the solid molecules. The desorbed gaseous molecules were ionized using a home-made helium dielectric barrier discharge ionization (DBDI) source and then detected by an ion trap mass spectrometer.

The TPE-SiO2 nanoparticles exhibit strong fluorescence emission due to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect of the doped TPE probe. The fluorescence emission of TPE-SiO2 offers quantitative and sensitive response to picric acid (PA), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) which are used as model examples of nitroaromatic compounds. The fluorescence spectroscopy results show that the fluorescence emission of TPE-SiO2 was greatly quenched in the presence of the electron-poor nitroaromatic compounds due to the inner filter effect (IFE) and possibly the contact quenching mechanism.

The removal of a typical nitroaromatic explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), from aqueous solution, was conducted using a new recyclable magnetic nano-adsorbent (Fe@SiO2–NH2). This adsorbent was prepared by grafting amino groups onto Fe@SiO2 particles with a well-defined core-shell structure and demonstrated monodispersity in solution. The removal performance of the nano-adsorbent towards TNT was found to be 2.57 and 4.92 times higher than that towards two analogous explosives, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), respectively, under neutral conditions. The difference in the removal performance among the three compounds was further compared in terms of the effects of different conditions (pH value, ionic strength, humic acid concentration, adsorbent modification degree and dosage, etc.) and the electrostatic potential distributions of the three compounds. The most significant elevation is owing to modification of amino on Fe@SiO2 which made a 20.7% increase in adsorption efficiency of TNT. The experimental data were well fit by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model, indicating multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface. The experimental results and theoretical considerations show that the interactions between Fe@SiO2–NH2 NPs and TNT correspond to dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions.

This practice is often scrutinized for the negative environmental impact of the odorous and unsightly toxic gaseous emissions as well as the resulting deposition residues, which often contain unburned energetic materials. With the increasing use of Insensitive High Explosive compositions in munitions, it is essential that the potential environmental impact of their disposal is assessed before their extensive use to prevent the kind of contamination incidents experienced with legacy explosives. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a controlled laboratory experiment to identify the gaseous emissions and the energetic material residues that are generated through the combustion of the IHE components 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). A sealed vial containing small (mg) quantities of energetic material was heated until the energetic material combusted. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to calculate the oxygen consumption and to identify the gases that were generated. The solid residues were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify unburned energetic material. Results showed that DNAN was the most resistant to burning, thus leaving significant quantities of unreacted starting material in the vial. An interesting observation for the IHE formulation was that DNAN also inhibited the combustion of NTO and RDX. The gases emitted during the open burning of IHE components and mixtures included CO, CO2, and N2O as expected, but the proportions differed when the components and mixture were compared, reflecting the influence of DNAN on the burning behavior.

The core-shell HMX@(Al@GAP) explosives with 5 wt% to 15 wt% aluminum were fabricated, with systematical investigation of morphology, mechanical properties, thermal decomposition, combustion and detonation properties. Compared with the physical mixtures, the aluminized explosives with core-shell microstructure showed better creep resistance and mechanical strength. The thermal decomposition of HMX in core-shell HMX@(Al@GAP) was slightly advanced due to good dispersion of Al@GAP particles. Delayed but more vigorous and longer burning during combustion process was witnessed for the core-shell explosive. For HMX@15 wt%(Al@GAP) aluminized explosives, the detonation velocity and specific kinetic energy was 8567 m/s and 1.412 kJ/g, which was 1.3% and 5.1% higher than the corresponding physical mixtures. The reaction of the core-shell HMX@(Al@GAP) and the physical mixtures were calculated by ReacFF-/g force field, showing remarkable dependent of the average temperature on the microstructure.

Therefore, it is particularly important to design and develop new methods and materials for detecting explosives. Herein, we report a novel aggregation-induced emission (AIE) supramolecuar fluorescent sensor based on a tripodal naphthalimide derivative (TNQ) for sensitive detection of the model explosive analogue picric acid (PA). The TNQ could self-assemble to a supramolecular system (S-TNQ) and show strong light blue AIE. The S-TNQ shows sensitive and selective response for PA. The detection limit (LOD) for PA was determined to be 4.73 × 10−8 M. Interestingly, the selective fluorescent response for PA is based on the competitive binding of PA with the TNQ, which destroyed the self-assembly and AIE of the S-TNQ. In addition, the solid powder of S-TNQ also showed recognition for PA under natural and UV irradiation by direct observation without instrumentation. The S-TNQ could serve as readily preparable, inexpensive, test kits for convenient detection PA. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85085733745"

IHEs are of interest for a range of applications and from a fundamental science standpoint, as the root causes behind insensitivity are poorly understood. We adopt a multitheory approach based on reactive molecular dynamic simulations performed with density functional theory, density functional tight-binding, and reactive force fields to characterize the reaction pathways, product speciation, reaction kinetics, and detonation performance of LLM-105. We compare and contrast these predictions to 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), a prototypical IHE, and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX), a more sensitive and higher performance material. The combination of different predictive models allows access to processes operative on progressively longer timescales while providing benchmarks for assessing uncertainties in the predictions. We find that the early reaction pathways of LLM-105 decomposition are extremely similar to TATB; they involve intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer. Additionally, the detonation performance of LLM-105 falls between that of TATB and HMX. We find agreement between predictive models for first-step reaction pathways but significant differences in final product formations.

In this paper, a new parameter named surface area diffusion rate was proposed to measure the migration of components from propellant and liner at interfaces of EPDM insulation, and the comparison with the traditional weight gain rate was made. The result shows that the surface area diffusion rate is independent of the shape of the material and is more reliable than previously used methods.

The thickening of imperfect shells at an ambient condition by the outward migration of core Al atoms to react with RDX is observed. This thickening is helpful to strengthen the shells and hold melted Al and enhance the internal stress until the crack.

Beside the acute risk of unwanted detonation, there is a chronic risk of contamination, because the metal vessels corrode and the toxic and carcinogenic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and metabolites) leak into the environment. While the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress in the target biota, we had the idea if TNT can induce the gene expression of carbonyl reductase in blue mussels. Carbonyl reductases are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. They metabolize xenobiotics bearing carbonyl functions, but also endogenous signal molecules such as steroid hormones, prostaglandins, biogenic amines, as well as sugar and lipid peroxidation derived reactive carbonyls, the latter providing a defence mechanism against oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we identified and cloned the gene coding for carbonyl reductase from the blue mussel Mytilus spp. by a bioinformatics approach. In both laboratory and field studies, we could show that TNT induces a strong and concentration-dependent induction of gene expression of carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel.

The sensing is based on the quenching of the Raman intensity of a zirconium-based MOF, Zr6O4(OH)4(dcppy)6(MOF1, UiO-67-dcppy; dcppy is 2-phenylpyridine-5,4′-dicarboxylate), where 50% of the signal quenches swiftly within ∼ 5 s of its exposure to trinitrophenol (TNP) vapours, while 90% of the Raman signal was quenched in 30 s. The high surface area of porous MOFs provides increased adsorption of various nitro analytes. The quenching of Raman peaks resulted from the π-π interactions of the analytes with the benzene ring of the MOF. The sensors have also been proven to be reversible and stable by mild heat treatment (80 °C for 5 min). These notable results using Raman spectroscopy point to a new and important approach towards explosive sensing using metal-organic frameworks considering their vast versatility.

It is generally assumed that MIP selectivity depends mainly on compatibility between the analyte and polymer being used. Accordingly, less research has concentrated on applying imprinting techniques to modify the polymeric material. Where applied, imprinting has traditionally been carried out with one or two small target molecules simply mixed with or loaded on polymers. In this study, we employed a novel alternative protocol incorporating dengue virus particles to assist imprinting of DNT. The binding sites and affinity of DNT with dengue surface protein were simulated for enhancing MIP selectivity. Composite MIP sensors were produced and tested to detect explosive molecules including DNT, TNT, and PETN in aqueous solution.

HPR-TC with E-nose has the novelty, amongst MEMS sensor platforms, of having two modes of operation i.e., rapid mode of detection to be used in time-critical conditions and comprehensive analysis mode for improved detection accuracy. Two modes of operations in HPR-TC are possible because of the implementation of hybrid PR featuring a combination of two different data analysis techniques for explosive sensing. The first part of the hybrid PR is the binary PR based on threshold-based detection and the second one is the analog PR based on PCA and K-mean. The E-Nose system with proposed HPR-TC is validated with two different highly sensitive MEMS sensor types, i.e., SU8 and Si3Nx piezo-resistive cantilever. These MEMS sensors are coated with surface receptors, 4-MBA, 6-MNA and 4-ATP, to improve the selectivity. The E-Nose system can detect explosive compounds such as TNT, RDX, and PETN, in a controlled environment at a concentration as low as 16ppb of TNT, 56ppb of RDX and 134ppb of PETN. Furthermore, measurements show that E-Nose with temperature compensated binary PR can detect the explosives with a detection accuracy higher than 74% as true positives and higher than 79% as true negatives in a short time, within initial 17 seconds of the experiment. However, the temperature compensated analog PR gives a detailed classification of explosives with a higher detection accuracy of 80% as true positives and 86% as true negatives after approximately 95 seconds. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85098762064"

As a proof of concept, a general colorimetric reagent based on potassium isopropanol (C3H7KO) and dimethyl sulfoxide for one-step instantaneous detection and discrimination of typical military and improvised explosives was designed. Vivid colors from none to purple red, blue green, yellow green, and green were shown, respectively, when detecting 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), elemental sulfur (S), and potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The unique design including the specific nucleophilic addition reaction and the base-catalyzed oxidation-induced electron transfer ensures perfect selectivity even upon facing more than 20 interferents. It is further experimentally demonstrated that the confinement effect introduced by Tween-20 plays an essential role in enhancing the color signal on the surface and thus boosts the detection performance even with a mass as low as 1.45 ng. The applicability of this versatile colorimetric reagent was further verified by integrating the reagent onto paper strips for the in-field identification of TNT, DNT, S, and KMnO4with the help of a portable smartphone-based microscope apparatus, and a practical detection mass of 10.3 ng could be realized.

For the first time, a large selection of ten commercially available 3D printing materials were comprehensively evaluated for practical, flexible and multiplexed SPE using stereolithography (SLA), PolyJet and fused deposition modelling (FDM) technologies. Miniaturised single-piece, connectable and leak-free block housings inspired by Lego® were 3D-printed in a methacrylate-based resin, which was found to be most stable under different aqueous/organic solvent and pH conditions, using a cost-effective benchtop SLA printer. Using a tapered SPE bed format, frit-free packing of multiple different commercially available sorbent particles was also possible. Coupled SPE blocks were then shown to offer efficient analyte enrichment and a potentially new approach to improve the stability of recovered analytes in the field when stored on the sorbent, rather than in wet swabs. Performance was measured using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry and was better, or similar, to commercially available coupled SPE cartridges, with respect to recovery, precision, matrix effects, linearity and range, for a selection of 13 peroxides, nitramines, nitrate esters and nitroaromatics.

Even several decades after the end of these wars, their residues are suspected to be widely present in the environment. Their occurrence and effect on ecosystems and human health are still not fully determined. This paper describes the development of a method for the determination of 28 nitroaromatic compounds in water, including isomers of nitrotoluene (NT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitrobenzene (NB), dinitrobenzene (DNB), chloronitrobenzene (ClNB), chlorodinitrobenzene (DNCB), nitronaphthalene (NN), dinitronaphthalene (DNN), nitroaniline (NA), dinitroanisole (DNAN), diphenylamine (DPA), and nitrodiphenylamine (nitro-DPA). In order to separate and individually quantify all the analytes with the best possible sensitivity, stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) was chosen as the extraction and pre-concentration step prior to gas chromatography (GC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry detection (MS/MS). Our SBSE optimization efforts focused on parameters such as the type of stir bar, ionic strength, addition of organic solvent, and extraction and desorption times. After these optimizations, the analytical method enabled us to reach limits of quantification (LOQs) between 1 and 50 ng/L in tap water, groundwater, and surface water. The method was applied to the determination of targeted nitroaromatic explosive residues in spring and groundwater samples collected in an area where mine warfare had raged during World War I.

Strains DNT, M30b and M109c transformed 2,4-DNT (100%), TNT (100, 94.7 and 63.6%, respectively), and PETN (72.7, 69.3 and 90.7%, respectively).

Genomes of R. planticola M30b and R. radiobacter M109c were sequenced to identify genes related with 2,4-DNT, TNT or PETN transformation. None of the tested strains presented DNT oxygenase, which has been previously reported in the transformation of 2,4-DNT. Thus, unidentified novel enzymes in these strains are involved in 2,4-DNT transformation.

Since short-term exposure to particulate matter correlates with increased mortality risks, these celebrations may impact both human health and the environment. Little is known about the particulate matter produced from recreational fireworks, as most studies have focused on professional large-scale events. In New Zealand, it is common for consumer fireworks to be ignited within residential areas during the Guy Fawkes celebration around 5 November. To better understand the contribution of individual fireworks on local air quality, ambient PM10 sampling was conducted in the 10 days surrounding Guy Fawkes Day in Auckland, New Zealand. These data were supplemented with measurements of firework emissions from 11 different individual products, including smoke bombs, sparklers, and Roman candles. Filter sampling results indicated that personal fireworks can contribute to ground level ambient air quality during celebrations, increasing ambient PM10 concentrations by 21.6 μg m−3 over a 12-h sampling period. The use of personal fireworks can expose consumers to PM10 concentrations much higher, up to 9.51 mg m−3 from individual sparkler use under worst-case scenario assumptions. The inhalation of sparkler emissions for just 8 min can lead to an exposure to PM10 mass greater than that from daily recommended limits (50 μg m−3 exposure over 24 h). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis indicated that potassium (K) and strontium (Sr) can be used as tracers for local firework use and that arsenic (As) may be an important contaminant during Guy Fawkes celebrations. The PM from personal fireworks contained large amounts of chlorine (Cl), which may be indicative of perchlorate oxidizers.

Encapsulated in 1.5 mm 2% alginate beads containing 1% polyacrylic acid, they also detected the location of a real metallic antipersonnel landmine under field conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the detection of a buried landmine with a luminescent microbial bioreporter. © 2020 The Authors.

It relies on bombarding unknown samples with neutrons emitted from a neutron source. These neutrons interact with the sample nuclei emitting the gamma spectrum with peaks at specific energies, which are considered a fingerprint for the sample composition. Analyzing these peaks heights will give information about the unknown sample material composition. Shielding the sample from gamma rays or neutrons will affect the gamma spectrum obtained to be analyzed, providing a false indication about the sample constituents, especially when the shield is unknown. Here we show how using deep neural networks can solve the shielding drawback associated with the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis technique in explosives detection. We found that the introduced end-to-end framework was capable of differentiating between explosive and non-explosive hydrocarbons with accuracy of 95% for the previously included explosives in the model development data set. It was also, capable of generalizing with accuracy 80% over the explosives which were not included in the model development data set. Our results show that coupling prompt gamma neutron activation analysis with deep neural networks has a good potential for high accuracy explosives detection regardless of the shield presence. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85089265902"

However, it is commonly believed by dog trainers that dogs can analyze mixtures and break them down into their individual components: that is, that they process odor mixtures analytically. There is, however, little experimental evidence to support this belief. This experiment was designed to determine whether dogs trained on mixtures of three or five different odors would detect the individual odors when each component was tested. Our results show that the dogs were able to respond to each of the components on their first trial with each separate element of the mixture (p < 0.001). This finding presents the first experimental proof that dogs trained to detect a mixture will later detect its individual components. These results may be attributed to previous extensive general training of the tested dogs to detect odors, and to their being reared and maintained in an enriched olfactory environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85099366725"

If TNT can be accumulated first to increase partial concentration near the sensor and detected by sensing materials then, the detection performance can be significantly improved. As we know, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is widely used as the sensing mechanism in TNT detection, which has an effective range of 10 nm. Based on this, we built an accumulation layer between sensing materials and TNT within effective range of FRET, where exists a large quantity of amino groups. The Amino groups can adsorb TNT and realize accumulation function. The accumulation and sensing layer played different roles in the detection of TNT based on distinct mechanism. Accumulation layer was realized by forming Meisenheimer complex between TNT and amino groups while sensing layer was realized by FRET. Via both two layers and mechanisms, the sensors achieved ultra-high sensitivity to TNT, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.6 nM and a linear range of 1–20 nM. Compared with pure graphene quantum dots (GQDs), the KSV of sensor in this work to TNT increased for about 14 times.

Laser ablation combined with a high-speed photography and an emission spectrometer in this paper provides a high time-resolution observation of the reaction process of energetic materials in laboratory scale. A sample plate with an array of cylindrical holes was used to load the explosive powders for high-throughput studies, and a complete fresh sample was ablated each time to ensure the consistency of the sample status. From the laser-ablated images, AH exhibits a longer combustion duration than aluminized RDX with no additional additives, and BH has an even longer combustion duration than AH. Both AH and BH show a monotonic decreasing trend in luminous intensities, but AH has higher intensities than BH from 3 to 30 µs. In addition to the observation of AlO molecular emission lines in the spectra of AH and BH, neutral magnesium (Mg I) emission lines were observed in the spectra of BH. The spectral distribution with time indicates that the oxidation reaction of Al is the main reason leading to persistent combustion in AH and BH. Overall analysis directly reveals that AP promotes the combustion of AH and makes the afterburning of Al with ambient air less significant, and B/MgH2 prolongs the combustion duration of BH. © 2020","2-s2.0-85089350253"

However, the Beirut explosion in Lebanon once again shows that AN has a risk of thermal runaway during storage, especially long-term storage or when some possible substances are mixed therein.

Especially, the thermal decomposition of AN added with 5% sodium halide and the evolved gases in the thermal decomposition process are investigated by C80 microcalorimetry and FTIR. The results show that all kinds of sodium halides have an effect on the thermal decomposition of AN, although these effects are different. The addition of the halide not only changes the timing of the formation of the AN thermal decomposition characteristic product, but also reduces the heat of the reaction. Combined with optimized kinetic parameters, the engineering prediction of thermal safety was carried out for each type of sample.

This is further enhanced by a novel double-glazing configuration which provides a simple and effective means for gas management, minimizing thermal variation within the assembly. Herein, we provide a full experimental characterization of the flexible DT ion mobility spectrometer (Flex-DT-IMS) with corresponding electrodynamic (Simion 8.1) and fluid dynamic (SolidWorks) simulations. The Flex-DT-IMS is shown to have a resolution >80 and a detection limit of low nanograms for the analysis of common explosives (RDX, PETN, HMX, and TNT).

Developing a large-scale but template-free fabrication of self-propelled rod/tubular micro/nanomotors is very crucial but still challenging. Here, a new strategy based on vertically aligned ZnO arrays is employed for the large-scale and template-free fabrication of self-propelled ZnO-based micromotors with H2O2-free light-driven propulsion ability. Brush-shaped ZnO-based micromotors with different diameters and lengths are fully studied, which present a fast response to multicycles UV light on/off switches with different interval times (2/5 s) in pure water and slow directional motion in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in the absence of UV light. Light-induced electrophoretic and self-diffusiophoretic effects are responsible for these two different self-motion behaviors under different conditions, respectively. In addition, the pH of the media and the presence of H2O2 show important effects on the motion behavior and microstructure of the ZnO-based micromotors. Finally, these novel ZnO-based brush-shaped micromotors are demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study on nitroaromatic explosive degradation, i.e., picric acid.

In this paper, direct ignition or initiation by pulsed laser was investigated of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) crystals doped with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for the first time. A nano-seconds pulsed laser was used for direct irradiation of the crystals at the GNP's surface-plasmon-resonance wavelength of 532 nm. RDX crystals were recrystallised from a solution containing GNPs and characterised by visual microscopy for surface coating and subsurface doping. A high-speed camera was used to observe and capture the modes of interaction between the GNPs-doped RDX crystals and pulsed laser irradiation with a new classification method. Laser fluence thresholds for ignition and initiation were established. The GNPs sensitized RDX to pulsed laser irradiation at this selected wavelength is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than pure RDX. Direct initiation of the GNPs doped RDX crystal at laser fluence of 0.04 J/cm2 led to the total consumption of a crystal sample, which was unreproducible with pure RDX. The results show that GNPs are effective optical sensitizers for direct initiation of RDX crystal by low-power pulsed laser. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85078477357"

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirmed thermal stability of DOTZ at 298 K and of DNDOTZ at 77 K. A comprehensive spectral characterization (IR, Raman, UV/Vis, NMR) has been performed to provide information for future experimental identification. The parent molecule exhibits powerful detonation properties, which exceed those of most compounds hitherto obtained experimentally or predicted theoretically. Meanwhile, DNDOTZ is predicted to be an effective solid oxidant for common explosives with negative oxygen balance, such as TNT, TNB, DATB, and TATB. Such mixtures demonstrate better propulsive properties than corresponding mixtures of these explosives with gaseous oxygen.

Pure Al, surface nitrided Al (AlN) and surface oxidized Al (AlO) particles are constructed to mix with RDX. The simulation results indicate that the decomposition mechanism of pure RDX is the elimination of HONO in the initial stage and the elimination of -NO2 in the later stage. The mechanism is further testified by the density functional calculation. RDX molecule adsorbs on the surface of Al particles to form N[sbnd]Al and O[sbnd]Al bonds. N[sbnd]O bond ruptures is the main decomposition ways of aluminiferous RDX in the initial stage. The decompositions of RDX and RDX/AlO need to overcome 2.00 kJ/g and 0.31 kJ/g energy barrier, respectively. However, there are no energy barriers in RDX/Al and RDX/AlN decomposition processes. Aluminiferous RDX decomposition depends on the strong attraction of Al to N and O. Alumina layer blocks the attraction of Al to O and N in RDX, causing the reactivity of AlO declines significantly.

They are low cost, photostable, and strongly photoluminescent materials, but so far have been little studied for sensing. In this article, we explore hybrid perovskites as sensors for explosive vapor. We tune the dimensionality of perovskite films in order to modify their exciton binding energy and film morphology and explore the effect on sensing response. We find that tuning from the 3D to the 0D regime increases the PL quenching response of perovskite films to the vapor of dinitrotoluene (DNT)-a molecule commonly found in landmines. We find that films of 0D perovskite nanocrystals work as sensitive and stable sensors, with strong PL responses to DNT molecules at concentrations in the parts per billion range. The PL quenching response can easily be reversed, making the sensors reusable. We compare the response to several explosive vapors and find that the response is strongest for DNT.

The constructed meso-structures possess good gradation relationship and have high PVFs (94.99% in maximum) simultaneously.

These were subsequently deposited on various objects, including microscopic glass slides, a table, a mug, etc. Samples deposited on glass slides were directly sent for analyses; for other samples, adhesive tapes were used to lift off fingermarks. In cases of difficulty in locating fingerprints, additional powders were used to enhance their visibility. Experiments were performed with a mIRage IR microscope working in a noncontact, far-field reflection mode, offering submicron IR spectroscopy and imaging. Fast imaging (several characteristic absorbances were selected for every substance of interest) was used to locate ""suspicious""particles among various residues present in fingerprints. Subsequently, spectra were collected for those particles. Reflection mode O-PTIR spectra taken from powdered and nonenhanced fingerprints were of comparable quality to transmission mode FTIR spectra collected for pure HEs. On the basis of the performed experiments, we consider O-PTIR spectromicroscopy to open a new avenue for the nondestructive, efficient, and reliable analysis of exogenous substances deposited within fingerprints. The real significance of O-PTIR is in its ability to deliver high-quality, spatially resolved FTIR transmission-like spectra below the diffraction limit of infrared wavelengths, doing so in an easy-to-use reflection (far-field) mode. Collected spectra are also searchable and interpretable in both commercial and institutional IR databases without mathematical modeling.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85089808119"

AN is an inorganic oxidizing salt that is commonly used in fertilizers and mining explosives, however, due to its widespread accessibility, AN-based explosives are also utilized for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IED). Pure AN crystals were ground to powder size and deposited on several substrates for Raman analysis, whereas FO was analysed in a quartz cuvette. To simulate field conditions samples of powdered AN, AN-water solutions (0.1% to 10.0% AN w/w), AN-soil (50% to 90% AN w/w) and FO-soil (50% to 75% FO w/w) were prepared and deposited on the clutter materials. Raman spectra were acquired at integration times between 0.1 and 30 s, and 3 replicate Raman measurements were carried out for each sample. The spectral window observed ranged from 300 to 3800 cm−1. Several characteristic Raman bands were found, namely, at 710 cm−1 (NO3 −) and 1040 cm−1 (NO3 −) for AN; 1440–1470 cm−1 (CH) and 2800–3000 cm−1 (CH) for FO; 3000–3500 cm−1 (OH) for water; and 615 cm−1 (CCl), 1254 cm−1 (CH), 1400 cm−1 (CH2) and 1600 cm−1 (aromatic ring) for polyvinyl chloride (PVC, electrical tape). The effect of the AN concentration and integration time on the total and net Raman intensities, relative standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratio and relative limit of detection was evaluated. The relative limit of detection of AN in water was 0.1% (1 mg/g), and absolute limit of detection was 1.0 μg.

EDSCB varied systematically on three automation reliability measures: accuracy, d', and positive predictive value (PPV). Results showed that when unaided performance was high, operator confidence was high, and automation provided only small benefits. When unaided performance was lower, operator confidence was lower, and automation with higher d' provided large benefits. Operator compliance depended on the PPV of automation: We found lower compliance for lower PPV. Automation with a high false alarm rate of 20% and a low PPV of .3 resulted in operators ignoring about one-half of the true automation alarms on difficult targets—a strong cry-wolf effect.

One of the toughest challenges is analyzing the interactions between incidents, known as “synergic effects.” As its research object, this paper takes multi-hazard coupling disasters involving fire, explosions, and toxicant leaks in hazardous chemicals scenarios. It aims to quantitatively analyze the synergic effects in such environments, taking into account the amplification of the severity of the incidents and the delay in the fire brigade intervention. A method based on Monte Carlo simulation and damage analysis was applied to assess the hazard of multi-hazard coupling disasters and demonstrate the impacts of synergic effects. The Monte Carlo simulations presented the cumulative distribution functions of the severities of incidents. To examine the effectiveness of the assessment method, a case study was conducted of the severe fire and explosion that occurred in a chemical plant in Yancheng, China, in 2019. The results show that the currently suggested safety distance from the chemical plant is insufficient due to the failure to take into account the synergic effects of multi-hazard coupling disasters. The influence radius of incidents involving hazardous chemicals may be further than 1500 m, instead of the 500 m safety distance required by the current regulations.

We provide streak images with other observations and demonstrate the behavior can be binned according to the degree of porosity evolved from physical and chemical damage to the compositions. In each bin, the DDT behavior eventually organizes to resemble Type I DDT, but differs in the early-stage burn phenomena and how a propulsive thermal explosion event arises. We argue that the hot explosive properties, such as permeability and compressibility, and the morphological characteristics of the thermal damage, control the physical mechanism for establishment of the thermal explosion. In some cases, these observations may need to be carefully implemented in numerical models to increase predictive value for these materials at elevated temperature. With high-porosity (ϕ ≈ 20–50%), the PBXs behaved like granular beds. At intermediate levels of porosity (ϕ ≈ 4–20%), the transition occurred over longer distances and the process is characterized by a weak, slow convective burn precursor that sets up thermal runaway to explosion behind the flame infiltration front. In the low-porosity bin (ϕ ≈ 0–4%), where run lengths were short, the thermal explosion is the result of compressive, and possibly also, deconsolidative burning. It is clear that the high-temperature conditions imposed in these experiments caused sensitization towards DDT and this effect was most apparent in tests where the explosive was heated until runaway and auto-ignition where transition distances were among the shortest measured. Practical findings include there being some safety benefit for having binders in HMX formulations, especially when the binder is thermally stable. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85079901335"

They are the second most commonly used group of explosives in the world, primarily due to the fact that they are a good alternative to ANFO explosives or dynamites. Their key advantage in underground applications is the lower content of toxic fumes in the detonation products. Emulsions are also characterized by high detonation velocity, high water resistance, low value of critical diameter and mechanical loading capacity. Multiple factors related to the applied mining method influence the detonation parameters of emulsion explosives. One such parameter is the time between the loading of the explosive into the blast hole and firing, which in the case of underground copper mines in Poland can even last up to 48 hours. This becomes a particularly significant issue due to the increasing depth of mining in Polish copper mines and the high virgin temperature of rock mass at these depths. Experiences related to the use of explosives and their efficiency under such conditions confirm the intuitive thesis that high ambient temperature has a negative impact on the explosives’ effectiveness. In this regard, research concerning the influence of temperature on the detonation velocity of selected emulsion explosives was carried out, including bulk and packaged explosives.

The NCQDs are conjugated with IRMOF-3 particles as IRMOF-3/NCQDs. The TEM micrograph revealed the average size of IRMOF-3 particles to be 363.66 nm. The photoluminescence emission intensity of IRMOF-3 particles at λem 430 nm is highly increased in the presence of NCQDs (λex 330 nm). Both the as-synthesized IRMOF-3 and IRMOF-3/NCQD particles are explored for TNT detection to compare the effect of NCQDs on the IRMOF-3 particle surface. Lower limit of detection (7.5 × 10−8 M) and higher Stern–Volmer constant (4.46 × 106 M−1) are achieved by IRMOF-3/NCQD particles. The association constant also increased from 5.3 × 104 to 2.78 × 106 M−1 after the conjugation of IRMOF-3 particles with NCQDs. Moreover, enhanced selectivity for TNT over trinitrophenol is achieved using the IRMOF-3/NCQD particles.

When employed as luminescent sensors, MOFs materials have some limitations, such as weak response signal and poor sensitivity. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) can especially enhance the sensing capabilities of MOFs and provide the possibility to design sensing materials with better performance. This review has been organized to introduce methods for the preparation of luminescent metal-organic frameworks (LMOFs) via PSM, including covalent PSM, dative PSM, encapsulated PSM, and tandem PSM schemes.

Especially, a set of nanowrinkles with 50−60 nm was found on the sidewall of nanocone after etching. By coating 30 nm gold film, this flexible SERS substrate provided uniform hot spots, which demonstrated high reproducibility and sensitivity. 4-ATP molecules based Meisenheimer complex, which is a well-known charge-transfer interaction between electron-poor TNT and electron-rich amino group, was taken to detect ultra-low concentration of TNT explosive. The Raman signal of TNT was significantly enhanced by charge-transfer, light trapping effect and coupled electromagnetic field. The detection sensitivity of TNT molecules was as low as 10−13mol/L, and show a good linear response in the range from 10−8 to 10−13mol/L. Consequently, by brushing this flexible SERS substrate onto a cloth bag, trace amount of TNT residues with concentration as low as 10-10mol/L can be easily analyzed.

Nanoenergetic materials (nEMs) have a high reaction rate and high energy density, which are both adjustable to a large extent. Structural control over nEMs to achieve improved performance and multifunctionality leads to a fascinating research area, namely, nanostructured energetic materials. Among them, core–shell structured nEMs have gained considerable attention due to their improved material properties and combined multiple functionalities. Various nEMs with core–shell structures have been developed through diverse synthesis routes, among which core–shell structured nEMs associated with explosives and metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are extensively studied due to their good tunability and wide applications, as well as excellent energetic (e.g., enhanced heat release and combustion) and/or mechanical properties.

Ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectroscopy has the potential to address these challenges through the reduction of fluorescence from background materials and increased Raman scattering due to the shorter wavelength (relative to visible or near-infrared excitation) and resonant enhancement effects. However, the benefits of UV Raman must be evaluated against specific operational situations: the actual realized fluorescence reduction and Raman enhancement depend on the specific target materials, target morphology, and operational constraints. In this paper, the wavelength trade-space in UV Raman spectroscopy is evaluated for one specific application: checkpoint screening for trace explosive residues. The optimal UV wavelength is evaluated at 244, 266, and 355 nm for realistic trace explosive and explosive-related compound (ERC) residues on common checkpoint materials: we perform semi-empirical analysis that includes the UV penetration depth of common explosive and ERCs, realistic explosive and ERC residue particle sizes, and the fluorescence signal of common checkpoint materials. We find that while generally lower UV wavelength provides superior performance, the benefits may be significantly reduced depending on the specific explosive and substrate. Further, logistical requirements (size, weight, power, and cost) likely limit the adoption of optimal wavelengths.

That is, the smaller the particle size, the more difficult the explosive to be ignited but the faster the detonation grows once the explosive is ignited. It is also found that the detonation grows the fastest in the explosive with moderate porosity. Moreover, a modified mesoscopic reaction rate model based on the experimental results and the pore collapse hot-spot ignition mechanism is developed, which allows for a separate reaction mechanism evaluation at different reaction stages for the shock initiation and detonation growth processes in the explosives. The calculated pressure-time histories and Pop-Plots for PBXC03 are founded to be all in good agreement with the experimental data.

Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis was performed to predict possible links between ETN samples and its precursors. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were determined for a wide variety of precursor sources and for ETN samples that were prepared with selected precursors. The stability of isotope ratios of ETN has been demonstrated for melt-cast samples and two-year old samples, which enables sample comparison of ETN in forensic casework independent of age and appearance. Erythritol and nitric acid (or nitrate salt) are the exclusive donor of carbon and nitrogen atoms in ETN, respectively, and robust linear relationships between precursor and the end-product were observed for these isotopes. This allowed for defining isotopic enrichment ranges for carbon and nitrogen that support the hypothesis that a given erythritol or nitrate precursor was used to synthesize a specific ETN batch. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms in ETN do not originate from one exclusive donor material, making linkage prediction more difficult. However, the large negative enrichments observed for both isotopes do provide powerful information to exclude suspected precursor materials as donor of ETN. Additionally, combing the isotopic data of all elements results in a higher discrimination power for ETN samples and its precursor materials. Combining the findings of our previously reported LC–MS analysis of ETN with this IRMS study is expected to increase the robustness of the forensic comparison even further.

In electrochemical screening, 5 μg of explosive material was detectable in 10 s by multicomponent cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis on unmodified glassy carbon under ubiquitous environmental influences (i.e., trace water and dissolved oxygen). The explosives were identified with high recoveries under a battery of proof-of-concept testing scenarios in various matrices. In AN containing naturally dissolved oxygen (approx. 2 mM), the superoxide radical is co-electrogenerated during analyte reduction. Free superoxide yields prominent signals that the explosives attenuate quantitatively. To gain further insight into the electrochemical transformation mechanism, spectroelectrochemistry was employed to monitor changes in ultraviolet (UV) absorbance during CV and identify transient intermediates and product species, which could be targeted by future chemical sensors. Overlapping UV spectra of multiple species are deconvoluted using a new strategy, spectral regional baselining, for time- and potential-resolved spectroelectrochemical (SEC) analysis. This study shows that dissolved oxygen, hitherto an interferent purposefully removed from the solution, can be exploited advantageously in electrochemical sensing.

First, image preprocessing is carried out by a background estimation algorithm. Then, a new fusion operator based on defects discrimination is implemented in a visual attention model to integrate intensity, orientation, and edge conspicuity into a saliency graph, in which a saliency effect of defects is considered during the fusion process. Third, a saliency map is divided into image blocks based on the image variance. This allows for the extraction of image blocks including defects, the calculation of the weighted eigenvalue, and the determination of regions containing multidefect.

We used a tabletop microscope equipped with 0-4.5 km/s laser-launched flyer plates to study shock initiation of TATB, which was fabricated in the form of an array of hundreds of plastic-bonded explosive minicharges (X-TATB = 80% TATB + 20% Sylgard 182 polymer). The 4 ns shocks from the flyer plates were not effective in initiating TATB, but we also developed a two-layer array where flyers first initiated a plastic-bonded PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) charge (X-PETN = 80% PETN + 20% Sylgard), which drove an initiating 25 ns shock into the X-TATB. Thermal emission from shocked X-TATB was used to measure time-dependent temperature profiles with a resolution of 2 ns and to produce high-speed (5 ns) videos. In X-TATB, flyer plates produced 2500-3500 K hot spots and combustion at 2500 K. With X-PETN initiators, X-TATB had 3500-4000 K hot spots and a powerful volume explosion lasting a few nanoseconds.

The research on the interaction mechanism between TKX-50 and AP is very important for designing TKX-50-AP compounds and judging the formation feasibility of composite particles, which can lay a theoretical foundation for the preparation of TKX-50-AP mixed crystals and the application of TKX-50 in propellant, propellant and explosive. Herein, in order to research the interaction mechanism between TKX-50 and AP, density-functional theory calculation was applied to optimize three configurations of TKX-50-AP compounds. The geometry structure, electrostatic potential and binding energy of the compounds were predicted, and the electronic density topological analysis was also carried out. Then TKX-50-AP mixed crystals structures were constructed, and the radial distribution function of H–O and H–N in mixed crystals was calculated. Finally, solvent/non-solvent method was applied to prepare TKX-50-AP composites, and the infrared spectroscopy and the non-isothermal decomposition performance of the composites were characterized. Results show that the superposition of positive charges in TKX-50 molecule and negative charges in AP makes the electrostatic potential distributions of TKX-50-AP compounds different from that of TKX-50 and AP. The interaction energies of TKX-50-AP 1, TKX-50-AP 2 and TKX-50-AP 3 are 39.743 kJ/mol, 61.206 kJ/mol and 27.702 kJ/mol, respectively. The interaction between TKX-50 molecules and AP molecules in TKX-50-AP mixed crystals both depends on hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force, and the number and strength of hydrogen bonds are significantly greater than that of van der Waals force. The composition of AP and TKX-50 makes the absorption peak of the five-membered rings and NH3OH+ of TKX-50 shift to low wavenumber in the infrared spectroscopy. In general, TKX-50 interacts with AP via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The composition of TKX-50 and AP can also prolong the decomposition process. © 2019","2-s2.0-85075854990"

The sensors exhibit preferential binding towards 4-nitro toluene (4-NT) and 2,6-dinitro toluene (2,6-DNT) based on the conformational orientation of the oxacalix[4]arene-host cavity. Spectrofluorimetric and 1H NMR titration studies support drastic changes inferred due to the complexation of the nitroaromatic explosives with FON3PPh and PON3PPh. The linear concentration range of FON3PPh for 4-NT is 5 μM to 4.5 mM with the detection limit of 2.4 μM and for PON3PPh, the linear concentration range 2,6-DNT is 0.5 μM to 5 mM with the detection limit of 0.1 μM. The binding ability of FON3PPh and PON3PPh for 4-NT and 2,6-DNT was determined as 1.15 × 104 M−1 and 3.02 × 104 M−1, respectively. Further, Density Functional Theory (DFT) based conformational modeling suggested that the spatial orientation of the guests in conformationally different hosts (PON3PPh and FON3PPh) lead to a varied selectivity pattern. The calculations also reveal that the complexation is thermodynamically favorable and selective.

Known to be a promising candidate, the reaction mechanism of glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) at typical detonation temperatures higher than 3000 K has been theoretically studied in this work at the atomistic level. By analyzing and tracking the cleavage of characteristic chemical bonds, it was found that at the detonation temperature, GAP was able to release a large amount of energy and small molecule products at a speed comparable to commonly used explosives in the early reaction stage, which was mainly attributed to the decomposition of azide groups into N2 and the main chain breakage into small fragments. Moreover, N2 generation was found to be accelerated by H atom transfer at an earlier reaction step. The dissociation energy of the main chain was lowered with structure deformation so as to facilitate the fragmentation of the GAP chain. Based on this analytical study of reaction kinetics, GAP was found to have higher reactivity at the detonation temperature than at lower temperatures. The small molecules' yield rate is of the same order of magnitude as an explosive detonation reaction, indicating that GAP has the potential to improve the performance of composite explosives.

Here we demonstrate a facile and rapid method to synthesize a fluorescent metal-organic framework for the highly selective and sensitive detection of nitroaromatic explosives.

The synthesized material shows visible colour changes upon exposure to TNT from ivory to light red. In addition, fluorescence quenching is noted under UV illumination when the ZnQ@ZIF-8 is exposed to TNT. The ZnQ@ZIF-8-coated paper sensors show the highest fluorescence quenching at an emission wavelength of 455 nm with TNT concentration as low as 1 ppm.

The experimental results show that, at the same horizontal distance from the initiation point, the peak overpressure of explosive shock wave of composition B explosive, both in the air and on the ground, is less than that of RDX and aluminized explosives. At a distance of 3.0 m from the initiation point, the peak overpressure of aluminized explosives is slightly less than that of RDX explosives.

Conversely, in the field, canine detectors are expected to generalize and identify variations of the target odor, while discriminating from similar extraneous or background odors. This exemplifies the balance between generalization and discrimination required for effective canine detectors. This research explored the tendency for detection canines to generalize or discriminate between similar odorants. Two groups of related odorants were used in two separate studies; (1) odorants of similar functional groups with differing carbon chains, and (2) odorants of similar carbon chain length but differing functional groups. Within each odorant set, the effect of training was addressed by incrementally increasing the number of odorants each canine was trained to detect. Initially, discrimination increased with increasing molecular dissimilarity in both odorant groups. After further training on additional related odorants, generalization increased across the set of odorants of the same carbon chain length, but there were no significant changes in either generalization or discrimination across the set of odorants of the same functional group. The results suggest that the canines in this study were more likely to generalize across compounds of the same chain length with differing functional group than across compounds of the same functional group, but differing chain lengths. Furthermore, some variation in performance between individual canines indicated that the tendency to generalize differed with experience, breed, and other factors affecting olfaction. © 2020","2-s2.0-85085496008"

In the present study, a simple surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing based on monoethanolamine (MEA) - modified gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was expanded for high selectivity and sensitive detecting of TNT in an envelope, luggage, lake water, and clothing through a quickly sampling and detection process. The monoethanolamine molecule based on Meisenheimer complex lights up ultra-high Raman scattering of a nonresonant molecule on the superficial coat of gold nanoparticles. Using this detection sensor, a molecular bridge can be established to selectively detect trinitrotoluene with a detection limit of 21.47 pM. We were able to rapidly identification trinitrotoluene molecule with a powerful selective over the familiar interfering substances nitrophenol, picric acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 2,4-dinitrotoluene. The outcome in this work supply an efficient solution to the test of trinitrotoluene and to establishing a SERS sensor analytical strategy. The studies have demonstrated that the MEA-Au NPs based SERS sensing can be potentially used in field detection the trace amount of chemical explosives for public security. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85084860029"

In addition, another mixture based on BCHMX and HMX as energetic fillers bonded by the polymeric matrix of Semtex 1H (Sem-BC+HMX) was studied. The particle size distribution of each individual explosive was determined to obtain the optimum mixing conditions. Friction and impact sensitivities were determined. The velocity of detonation was reported practically and the detonation properties were calculated by EXPLO5 code. The explosive strength of each sample was measured by the ballistic mortar test. The conclusion confirms that the velocity of detonation of Sem-BC+HMX was the highest in comparison with the prepared samples. Sem-BC+RDX has the least impact and frictions sensitivities.

These compounds are not removed by biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants and they may affect the removal of ammonium, nitrate, organic nitrogen by these treatment systems. Therefore, this research proposes a new and innovative low-cost and easy-to-apply pre-treatment to treat low biodegradable and high nitrogen wastewaters, using explosive wastewaters as case study. The pre-treatment is composed by immediate one-step lime precipitation (IOSLM) and atmospheric CO2 carbonation (AC) processes. The novelty of the proposed pre-treatment is based firstly on the use of one reactant (hydrated lime) at high concentrations, added in one step, that produces immediately an abundant and insoluble precipitate able to sweep the organic matter and other contaminants from wastewater in a short time and ensure conditions (pH and Ca2+) for the AC process. Secondly, the AC process uses the sludge produced in IOSLM to keep pH high for longer, allowing ammonia removal while simultaneously the pH is reduced by spontaneous reactions with atmospheric CO2. IOSLM results showed 92.1 %, 98.2 % and 100 % of organic matter, oils and fats, and organic nitrogen removals, respectively, for the optimal hydrated lime dose (7.76 g L-1).

CL-20/HMX nano-plates were prepared by spray flash evaporation. To ensure co-crystallinity and nanostructures, powder X-ray diffraction and AFM investigations were performed. The results demonstrate that coherence lengths and particle dimensions are on a similar level though coherence lengths appear shorter than measured particle dimensions. According to this fact, defects inside the nano co-crystals are minimized. The co-crystallinity was additionally proven by confocal Raman spectroscopy. Here, marker bands for pristine CL-20 and HMX were chosen which appear in the CL-20/HMX spectrum in an intensity ratio of ∼2.5 : 1 (CL-20 : HMX). Afterwards surface investigations of single CL-20/HMX nano-plates were performed by AFM-TERS. Due to the surface sensitivity of TERS, these experiments reveal that the ratio of the Raman intensities between CL-20 and HMX inverts at CL-20/HMX nano-plate surfaces. Therefore, it is concluded that nano co-crystal surfaces consist of molecular layers of HMX. A theoretical approximation of the normal coordinates of the investigated marker vibrations supports this conclusion since it can exclude the occurrence of the intensity ratio inversion because of the given orientation between CL-20/HMX nano-plates and the Raman scattering system.

The quick dissipation of the excited photons is successfully controlled by the restriction of rotation of the phenyl units through the formation of a mesoporous network scaffold in a solid/thin film, which provides high quantum yields for the interlocked CMO system. Both the CMOS are sensitive and selective to the various nitroaromatic explosives, whereas CMO1 is more sensitive (Ksv = 2.6 × 106 M-1) toward picric acid. The increased quenching constant for CMO1 is due to its increased quantum yield and high energy-transfer efficiency. The mechanism for sensing has been studied in detail.

The thermal parameters, such as adiabatic temperature rise(ΔTad,r) and maximum temperature of the synthesis reaction (MTSR), were calculated for assessing the thermal hazard of HMX synthesis.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by IEDs results in different degrees of impairment of cognition and behavior, but the exact brain pathophysiological mechanism following exposure to blast has not been clearly investigated. Here, we sought to establish a rat model of closed-head blast injury using compressed gas to deliver a single blast only to the brain without systemic injuries. The cognitive functions of these bTBI models were assessed by Morris Water Maze test (MWM test). The HE staining, flow cytometry, ELISA and Western Blotting were used to measure the effects of shock wave on general histology, regulatory T (Treg) cells percentage, inflammatory reactions, the expression and phosphorylation level of tau, respectively. In addition, the brain water content and 24 -h mortality were also assessed. As the distance from the blast source increased, the input pressure did not change, the overpressure decreased, and the mortality decreased. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting 24 -h mortality using peak overpressure fits with the following areas under ROC curves: 0.833. In 2 weeks after blast injury, cognitive tests revealed significantly decreased performance at 20 cm distance from the blast (about 136.44 kPa) as demonstrated by increased escape latency in the acquisition phase, and decreased crossing numbers in the probe phase of MWM test. Interestingly, a single blast exposure (at 20 cm) lead to significantly increased tau phosphorylation at the Thr205 epitope but not at the Ser404 and Ser262 epitopes at 12 h, 24 h, 3d, and 7d after blast injury. Blast decreased the percentage of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, Treg cells and lymphocytes at different time points after blast injury, and blast increased the percentage of neutrophils at 12 h after blast injury and significantly increased IL-6 production at 12 h, 24 h and 3d after blast injury. In addition, blast lead to an increase of brain edema at 24 h and 3d after blast injury. However, no obvious alterations in brain gross pathology were found acutely in the blast-exposed rats. In conclusion, we established a rat model of simple craniocerebral blast injury characterized by impairment of cognitive function, Thr205 phosphorylation of tau, decreased Treg cells and increased inflammatory reactions and brain edema.

In order to predict ignition and deflagration of propellants containing these ingredients, their thermal decomposition behaviors must be thoroughly understood. In this study, the thermal decomposition of HMX was investigated using synergetic application of experimental and computational methods. Mole fraction profiles of the gaseous decomposition products evolving from the liquid-phase HMX were obtained using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for two types of thermolysis experiments – thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and confined rapid thermolysis (CRT). Four heating rates (5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min) in TGA experiments and four set temperatures (290, 300, 310 and 320 °C) in CRT experiments were considered. In the TGA and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, steep mass loss and rapid decomposition were observed after the melting of the HMX at 280 °C. CH2O and N2O were identified as the major decomposition products. Smaller quantities of H2O, HCN, NO and NO2, CO and CO2 were also formed. In the complementary computational study, liquid-phase elementary reactions were investigated using quantum mechanics calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). A zero-dimensional model was developed to simulate the TGA and CRT experiments based on conservation of mass and species in the condensed-phase and the gas-phase control volumes. The predicted mass loss and gas-phase mole fraction profiles of the decomposition products are in good agreements with the corresponding experimental results, indicating that the comprehensive mechanism proposed here captures the important reactions occurring during liquid-phase decomposition of HMX. © 2019","2-s2.0-85074163124"

Considering the utilization of a light source and the operating spectral region, the presented overview classifies the related HSI systems as active and passive systems in the long-wave and short-wave infrared spectra, and investigates the methods in each class with respect to the targeted explosives, illumination and capturing devices, target detection algorithms, and performance evaluation methodologies. The investigation has revealed the major challenges for a generic surveillance system as 1) a thorough experimental performance validation with respect to time, date, and orientation, 2) sufficient acquisition speeds to capture moving vehicles, 3) registration and regulation of different spectral bands captured at different positions of the movement in a dynamic scene, 4) lower false positive rates required for the dynamic scenes compared to static control points, and 5) white reference compensations for the reflectance conversion in a continuous and secure surveillance system.

Therefore, the investigation of thermal stability of HNBB can be important in the yield of preparation of HNS. The decomposition kinetic of HNBB and HNS are studied by non-isothermal gravimetric method. The TG/DTG curves in non-isothermal method are obtained in range of 25°C–400 °C at heating rates of 3 °C/min, 5 °C/min, 8 °C/min, 10 °C/min and 12 °C/min.

In many cases, such devices are plastic, or varied metallic objects containing rudimentary explosives, which are not visible to the naked eye and are difficult to detect autonomously. The most effective strategy for detecting land mines also happens to be the most dangerous. This paper intends to leverage the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to aid in the discovery of such IEDs. As part of a related project, an autonomous sensor array was used to detect the devices in terrains too hazardous for a human to survey. This paper presents a CNN and its training methodology, suitable to make use of the sensor system. This convolutional neural network can accurately distinguish between a potential IED and surrounding undergrowth and natural features of the environment in real-time. The training methodology enabled the CNN to successfully recognise the IEDs with an accuracy of 98.7%, in well-lit conditions. The results are evaluated against other convolutional neural systems as well as against a deterministic algorithm, showing that the proposed CNN outperforms its competitors including the deterministic method.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

This approach yielded LPCMP1-4, CMPs with significantly higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (more than 5 times higher) than other related BH-based CMPs. These CMPs possess not only high BET specific surface areas and high chemical and thermal stabilities, but also exhibit outstanding swellability. To the best of our knowledge, swellable behavior was studied in great detail for CMPs for the first time, with the greatest degree of swelling for methanol reaching 16.5 and 16.3 mL g-1 for LPCMP1 and LPCMP3, respectively. Owing to their excellent swellability, we further studied the adsorption capacity of these CMPs for different toxic organic vapors (including toluene and methanol). LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 adsorbed 124 and 117 mg g-1 toluene, respectively, at saturated vapor pressure. For methanol, the adsorption capacities of LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 were up to 250 and 215 mg g-1, respectively, which are the highest recorded values when compared with published data for CMPs, HCPs, MOFs, and porous carbons. These materials are promising candidates for the removal and elimination of hazardous organic vapors and chemical warfare agents. Moreover, all the polymers show high sensitivity to nitroaromatic explosives.

The copresence of diverse types of organic (TNT, RDX, and HMX) and inorganic pollutants (Pb, Cu, Cd, Ni, Cr, Zn, As, and Sb) can cause endless damage to the environment. Therefore the presence of these pollutants at a single site makes them a good option for studying the behavior and transformation mechanisms of both types of pollutants. Traditional remediation approaches can render the toxicity of pollutants at these sites. However, they are not preferred due to their high cost, low public acceptability, indirect harm to the environment, and more labor involvement. Contrary to it, such sites that are highly contaminated with organic pollutants, metals, and metal(loid)s can be managed by using various approaches like bioremediation, bacterial degradation/transformation, phytoremediation, phytoextraction, immobilization, and combination of these techniques. Likewise the sites polluted with organic explosives, strategies like phytotransformation, bioremediation, bioaugmentation, and photolysis are recommended, which can reduce the levels of toxicants by their transformation, degradation, and conversion into nontoxic forms, whereas phytoextraction, bacterial transformation, in situ immobilization, and phytostabilization can deem the risk of inorganic pollutants at such sites. By undertaking these techniques and management practices, the harm to the environment from these polluted shooting ranges can be scaled down. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous studies have sought to connect various physical and chemical properties of the energetic molecules and materials to their measured impact sensitivities. Wenograd in the early 1960s demonstrated that there is a strong dependency of the drop-heights on the critical temperatures required for explosives to undergo prompt reactions. Reactive quantum molecular dynamics simulations with the lanl31 density functional tight binding model have been used to compute the delay time before the thermal explosion of the secondary explosives erythritol tetranitrate (ETN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), trinitrotolune (TNT), and 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) as a function of the initial temperature and pressure. The delay time to explosion data are consistent with Arrhenius chemical kinetics, which is expected for thermally activated processes in materials and in accord with experimental measurements. The critical temperatures required for the materials to undergo prompt explosions display the same dependence on drop height as was observed by Wenograd.

In this work, the sensing chromophores were dendritic side chains attached to a norbornenyl-derived polymer backbone. The sensing chromophore of each poly(dendrimer) was based on fluorene and carbazole moieties, both of which have been shown to be sensitive toward nitro-containing explosives. The monomers, and corresponding polymers, were screened against 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB) vapors and a range of household interferents such as mouthwash and ethanol. An important result of this work was the rapid and sensitive detection of DMNB, a taggant added to commercial plastic explosives, which is usually difficult to detect via fluorescence quenching due to its relatively low electron affinity and spontaneous diffusion out of the sensing film. Testing of the poly(dendrimer)s was also performed with a hand-held prototype detector for explosives. Selectivity was demonstrated with a range of interferents and explosive or taggant vapors, with the interferents giving an increase in fluorescence intensity and the explosive related materials a quenching of the luminescence. The results show that organic semiconductor poly(dendrimer)s are an interesting class of material for the detection of nitro-based explosives and taggants, especially DMNB.

The theory of the fluorescence quenching was used to analyze the principle of explosives sensing. The effects of the refractive index (RI) and thickness of the fluorescence film on the light intensity at the core inner wall were analyzed theoretically and numerically. The results show that when the RI of the fluorescence film was close to 1.45 and the thickness was close to 150 nm, the normalized intensity of the light field energy at the core inner wall was 9.72%. The HC-PCF fluorescence explosive sensor was fabricated by a multiple cleaving filling technique and a pressure driven coating method. The experimental results show that the sensitivity of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection was 0.309/ppb and the minimum detection limit was 0.340 ppb for the sensor with a film thickness of 155 nm.

Our numerical model allowed us to estimate the peak overpressure of a blast wave around an underground magazine with or without a dike. We varied the internal length-to-diameter ratio of the underground magazine to compare the effects of magazine length. We found that the dike prevented the blast wave and detonation products from expanding along the exit direction and mitigated the peak overpressure near the dike. Our simulated results for peak overpressures outside the magazine on the ground agreed well with experimental results. The azimuthal characteristics, how the peak overpressure was reduced by the increment of the azimuth angle, were independent of the internal length-to-diameter ratio of the magazine. The presence of a dike, however, does change the shape of the iso-peak overpressure zone around the magazine exit which would determine the explosive safety quantity–distance. With a dike, the iso-peak overpressure zone is a circle, and it is an ellipse without the dike on the ground.

Both neat AN and AN containing various contaminants are examined, however quantitative kinetics results are not encompassed. Also not included is the performance of AN as the oxidizer in rocket propellants or in explosives such as ANFO. The review is intended to be the most comprehensive review of decomposition reactions of AN since Berthelot's treatise of 1892. Despite hundreds of papers on the topic that have appeared in the intervening years, understanding of decomposition mechanisms remains only modestly more complete than it was in Berthelot's day. However, some additional reaction steps and mechanisms have been identified and these are discussed. Explosions of AN most commonly involve fire as the proximate cause, yet chemical-mechanism research on the topic is nil. A modest number of studies have explored the potentiation of AN decomposition by organic contaminants. These have, thus far, not produced guidance useful for promoting of safety from fire-related causes. Contamination from inorganic sources, notably chlorides is better understood and some mechanisms have been studied.

Prior to pure explosive preparation into PBX, the interactions between the components must be evaluated. Examination of interactions between bistetrazole ionic salt and ammonium nitrate explosive in thermal decomposition is beneficial in revealing the interactive mechanism of these two kinds of energetic materials in decomposition, as well as in the evaluation of compatibility, safety, and reliability of PBX explosive based on TKX-50, ABTOX, HMX, and RDX. Herein, the thermal decomposition behavior of TKX-50/HMX, ABTOX/HMX, TKX-50/RDX, and ABTOX/RDX is investigated. Ammonium nitrate explosives can significantly reduce the thermal decomposition peak temperature of the bistetrazole ionic salt. For example, HMX reduces the decomposition peak temperatures of the first and second stages of TKX-50 by 4 and 15 K, respectively, and ABTOX by 26 K (heating rate 5 K min−1). Utilizing HMX, the interaction mechanism between ammonium nitrate explosives and bistetrazole ionic material in thermal decomposition was investigated in detail. Changes in gas products, morphology, and molecular structure of the materials during decomposition show that TKX-50 induces HMX to HONO elimination decomposition, while ABTOX induces HMX open-loop decomposition. Furthermore, the heat generated by HMX decomposition accelerates the decomposition of TKX-50 and ABTOX. Moreover, the melting characteristics of HMX and molten product formation in the decomposition of TKX-50 and ABTOX promote the interaction between solid phase materials. Additionally, using calculation simulation, we confirmed that NH3OH+ in TKX-50 transfers hydrogen to the HMX nitro group, resulting in the HONO elimination of HMX, while the bistetrazole N-oxide anion in ABTOX and its alkaline decomposition intermediate product captures the hydrogen of the HMX main ring and causes HMX ring-opening decomposition. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85074754684"

We report a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based gas sensor functionalized with a peptide receptor to detect dinitrotoluene (DNT), which is a byproduct of trinitrotoluene (TNT). We fabricated the multi-arrayed rGO sensor using spin coating and a standard microfabrication technique. Subsequently, the rGO was subjected to photolithography and an etching process, after which we prepared the DNT-specific binding peptide (DNT-bp, sequence: His-Pro-Asn-Phe-Se r-Lys-Tyr-IleLeu-HisGln-Arg-Cys) and DNT non-specific binding peptide (DNT-nbp, sequence: Thr-Ser-Met-Leu-Leu-Met-Ser-Pro-Lys-His-Gln-Ala-Cys). These two peptides were prepared to function as highly specific and highly non-specific (for the control experiment) peptide receptors, respectively. By detecting the differential signals between the DNT-bp and DNT-nbp functionalized rGO sensor, we demonstrated the ability of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) targets to bind to DNT-specific binding peptide surfaces, showing good sensitivity and selectivity. The advantage of using the differential signal is that it eliminates unwanted electrical noise and/or environmental effects. We achieved sensitivity of 27 ± 2 × 10−6 per part per billion (ppb) for the slope of resistance change versus DNT gas concentration of 80, 160, 240, 320, and 480 ppm, respectively. By sequentially flowing DNT vapor (320 ppb), acetone (100 ppm), toluene (1 ppm), and ethanol (100 ppm) onto the rGO sensors, the change in the signal of rGO in the presence of DNT gas is 6400 × 10−6 per ppb whereas the signals from the other gases show no changes, representing highly selective performance.

Inspection services have limited manpower and means to perform extensive visual inspection.

Two emerging trace detection techniques, i.e., capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based inorganic oxidizer detector and infrared thermal desorption (IRTD) coupled with direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS), were investigated for their potential as screening tools. Detection of non-visible pyrotechnic trace residues from real-case seized parcels was demonstrated using both screening techniques.

In an explosive spin crossover complex, these changes could affect the mechanical and initiation sensitivity of the explosive and lead to the development of a new class of sensitivity switchable materials. To explore this relationship, the well-known spin crossover compound [Fe(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (1) was re-evaluated for its explosive properties, and its mechanical impact sensitivity was correlated to spin transition. A variable temperature impact test was developed and used to evaluate the impact sensitivity of 1 in the low spin (LS, S = 0), thermally accessed high spin (HS, S = 2), and mixed LS and HS states. For comparison, the structurally similar Ni compound, [Ni(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (2), which does not undergo a spin transition at accessible temperatures, was synthesized and characterized, and its explosive properties and variable temperature impact sensitivity measured. These results reveal a correlation between impact sensitivity and spin transition, where 1 exhibits lower impact sensitivity in the LS state and increases in sensitivity upon transition to the HS state. Density functional theory was used to predict structural changes that occur upon spin transition that correlate to the change in sensitivity.

Both at 25 °C and −40 °C, the fracture toughness of thick specimens is higher than that of thin specimens, and at low temperature the change is more obvious. A master curve of quadratic function for the fracture toughness was obtained. The influence of temperature on the fracture toughness is more obvious than that of the strain rate with double factor analysis of variance. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Identifying potentially successful working dogs as early as possible is important as rejection rates are high and training is costly. Earlier research has mainly concentrated on personality traits such as boldness, and there is only little knowledge on the possible association between cognitive traits and the actual working dog performance. This study investigated whether motor inhibition, persistence, problem-solving strategies, and spatial problem-solving are associated with explosive detection success in specially trained police dogs. Dogs (N = 24) were tested with a cognitive test battery, and subsequently they participated in an explosive detection test. The explosive searching situation and the location of the test was such that it would reflect as much as possible a real-life situation. Canine handlers also filled in a questionnaire regarding their dog's working behaviour. We found that those dogs that were more successful in explosive detection task had better motor inhibition in a cylinder task compared to dogs with lower success in an explosive search task. Furthermore, we found that dogs that made more errors in the cylinder task were generally more likely to give up searching sooner, as reported by their handlers, and also abandon sooner the problem-solving task in behavioural test. This study suggests that inhibitory control, specifically motor inhibition, may be an important aspect to consider when selecting suitable dogs for explosive detection tasks. Cylinder task is an easy and quick way to assess inhibitory control, although a larger dataset is needed to verify its association with working performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85079406671"

The ball drop impact sensitivity tester is a device in which a free-falling steel ball is dropped onto an unconfined sample, and is expected to produce more realistic results than the currently commonly used BAM method.

The most common methods currently employed for the detection of explosives involve colorimetric tests, which are known to be rapid and portable; however, they often display false positives and lack sensitivity. Other methods used include ion mobility mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which despite producing more reliable results often require large, expensive instrumentation and specially trained staff. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that utilizes the formation of a colored Janowsky complex with nitroaromatic explosives through reaction of the enolate ion of 3-mercapto-2-butanone. The colored complex is formed rapidly and can then be detected sensitively using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). We demonstrate that SERS can be used as a quick, sensitive, and selective technique for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexanitrostillbene (HNS), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl) with a detection limit of 6.81 ng mL-1 achieved for TNT, 17.2 ng mL-1 for tetryl, and 135.1 ng mL-1 for HNS. This method of detection also requires minimal sample preparation, can be done in a solution-based format, and utilizes the same precursor reagents for complex formation with each of the explosives which can then be identified due to the specificity of the unique SERS response obtained. We demonstrate the ability to simultaneously identify three explosive compounds within a total analysis time of 10 min. This method of detection shows promise for the development of rapid and portable SERS-based assays which can be utilized in the field in order to achieve reliable and quantitative detection.

Cocrystallization of CL-20 with other suitable HEMs and LEMs is considered as the best crystal engineering technique to reduce its sensitivity [2, 4–6] as it masks crystal defects which in turn are responsible for mechanical sensitivity. The present investigation reports on the scale up process for the synthesis of Energy-Energy Cocrystallization (EECC) of ϵ-CL-20 and RDX and focus on the process to optimize the structure and energetics of thus formed cocrystal (CRCC) through DFT study.

The sensor relied on attaching methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine dye with a planar structure, onto negatively charged AuNPs, and exploited the dye's electrostatic interactions with the large oxyanion, perchlorate. Ion-pair formation between MB@AuNP nanocomposite and AP led to nanoparticle aggregation, causing a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of AuNPs. This new peak emerged at around 650 nm, giving rise to the development of a ratiometric sensor by taking the ratio of 650 nm absorbance to that at 520 nm (pertaining to nanocomposite) and correlating this ratio to AP concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sensor for AP were 2.4 × 10−5 and 8.3 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively. The recovery of AP from ternary mixtures containing TNT and HMX was accomplished by water extraction using solubility differences.

Although the framework here is general, the particular material considered in this paper is pressed Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3,5-tetrazocine (HMX). To systematically delineate the effects of material heterogeneities, four material cases are considered. These cases are homogeneous material, material with granular microstructure but no voids, homogeneous material with voids, and material with both granular microstructure and voids. Statistically equivalent microstructure sample sets (SEMSS) are generated and used. Eulerian hydrocode simulations explicitly resolve the material heterogeneities, voids, and the coupled mechanical-thermal-chemical processes. In particular, it is found that both microstructure and voids strongly influence the SDT behavior and PP. The effects of different combinations of microstructure heterogeneity and voids on the SDT process and PP are quantified and rank-ordered. The overall framework uses the Mie–Grüneisen equation of state and a history variable reactive burn model (HVRB). A novel probabilistic representation for quantifying the PP is developed, allowing the calculation of (1) the probability of observing SDT at a given combination of shock pressure and run distance, (2) the run-distance to detonation under a given combination of shock pressure and prescribed probability, and (3) the shock pressure required for achieving SDT at a given run distance with a prescribed probability.

The performance of field-portable TD-GC-MS systems when deployed to multiple remote sites was studied, and a large variability in sensitivity and performance was observed when using the manufacturer-prescribed methods for calibration of instruments and normalisation of the data. This variability was remedied by the implementation of a non-interfering calibration that is pre-incorporated onto the sorbent media. Use of an in-situ calibration curve constructed using stable isotope labelled standards provided robust quantification, accuracy of measurement and diagnostic capabilities for malfunctioning fielded equipment. Pre-incorporation of isotopic analogues onto thermal desorption tubes in advance of field distribution greatly improves the accuracy and reproducibility of analyses and demonstrates, for the first time, definitive quantification of target analytes using field-portable GC-MS in an operational theatre. © 2020 Journal Compilation CSIRO 2020 Open Access.","2-s2.0-85072250335"

The growth in popularity of LIBS is rapid, with applications being published for most sample types. This is undoubtedly because of its capability to analyse in situ on a production line (hence saving time and money) and its minimally destructive nature meaning that both forensic and cultural heritage samples may be analysed. It also has a standoff analysis capability meaning that hazardous materials, e.g. explosives or nuclear materials, may be analysed from a safe distance. The use of mathematical algorithms in conjunction with LIBS to enable improved accuracy has proved a popular area of research. This is especially true for ferrous and non-ferrous samples. Similarly, chemometric techniques have been used with LIBS to aid in the sorting of polymers and other materials. An increase in the number of papers in the subject area of alternative fuels was noted. This was at the expense of papers describing methods for the analysis of crude oils. For nanomaterials, previous years have seen a huge number of single particle and field flow fractionation characterisations. Although several such papers are still being published, the focus seems to be switching to applications of the nanoparticles and the mechanistic aspects of how they retain or bind with other analytes.

Using SECDI, enhancements in the IMS signal for TNT and 2,6-DNT vapors at trace concentrations are as much as 2–26 times that observed with CD or SESI alone. The enhancement in sensitivity is hypothesized to result from an increase in ionization efficiency driven by a higher number of reactant ions associated with SECDI compared to either technique individually.

NC and NG are aliphatic nitrate ester compounds that are manufactured by nitrating through immersion in acid. Solid propellants are used in a wide range of both civilian and military applications, for example, as gas generators in airbags, as fuels in rocket motors or to shoot projectiles in guns. In all illustrations, the function of solid propellant is to generate gas, which is then employed to do mechanical work. The maximum pressure and the projectile velocity are important parameters of the interior ballistic process. The goal of the interior ballistic design of the gun is to attain a higher muzzle velocity under the smaller maximum chamber pressure. The burning rate of the propellant directly affects the formation rate of burning gases, which affects the ballistic parameters, either by diminishing the ballistic effectiveness or raising the safety hazard to the operator during firing. Note that the effect of the change of burning rate is not always negative; the fact is that we could change/control the burning rate to get better ballistic performances, includin ballistic efficiency as well as launching safety. Nevertheless, nitrate ester propellants are subjected to physical and chemical degradation during storage and this can modify the burning rate. Here we describe the effect of aging on the burning rate of spherical double-base propellants both qualitatively and quantitatively. We experimented unaged propellant, and propellant that was artificially aged at 71°C and 80ºC. The durations of heating at 71ºC were 10, 20, 30, 37, 48 and 62.5 days, respectively. The durations of heating at 80ºC were 1.8, 3.63, 5.41, 7.22, 9.02 and 10.83 days, respectively. The burning rate of investigating propellant was obtained by using closed-vessel experiments. The results show that towards low pressures, the burning rate increased with aging. Towards high pressure, the burning rate decreased as a function of aging. The effect of aging was quantified by the determination of defined aging sensitivity coefficients. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85071148297"

We demonstrate the computational capabilities by studying the effect of porosity on the reactive shock response of a coarse-grain (CG) model of the energetic material cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), the non-reactive equation of state for a porous representative volume element (RVE) of CG RDX, and utilization of available supercomputing resources for speculative sampling to accelerate hierarchical multiscale simulations. Small amounts of porosity (up to 4 %) are shown to have significant effect on the initiation of reactive CG RDX using large-scale reactive dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Non-reactive RVEs are shown to undergo a porosity-dependent pore collapse at hydrostatic conditions, and an existing automation framework is shown to be easily modified for the incorporation of microstructure while retaining reliable convergence properties.

Effective June 1, 2016, House Bill 2852 enabled all Class C fireworks to be sold within the state. The effects of this policy on fireworks-related injuries requiring immediate medical care are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this policy may have affected the fireworks-related injury rate and/or injury severity. Methods: Data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients treated by West Virginia University Medicine between June 1, 2015-May 31, 2017. The pre and post law periods were defined as June 1, 2015-May 31, 2016 and June 1, 2016-May 31, 2017, respectively. Fireworks-related injuries were identified via International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification codes and by free text searches of the electronic medical records. The rate of injuries pre and post-legislation were compared by Exact Poisson Regression, while demographic characteristics and injury severity were compared via Fisher's Exact tests. Results: 56 individuals were treated for fireworks-related injuries during the study period. The majority of patients were over 25 years of age (64%) and male (77%). Most of the injuries occurred within 7 days of a celebrated U.S. holiday (64%), and 28% were severe in nature. Age, sex, and injury severity did not significantly differ pre and post law passage. The injury rate per 100,000 patients was 39% higher after the law was enacted (p = 0.3475; incidence rate ratio 1.39, 95% Confidence Interval 0.74, 2.68). Conclusion: The law increasing access to Class C fireworks may have affected the injury rate, but not injury severity among treated patients.

Even though commercial and military explosives mainly rely on a small number of high-energy compounds, a great variety of additives and synthesis by-products can be found that can differ depending on the brand, manufacturer and application. This makes the identification of commercial and military explosives based on their overall composition a promising approach that can be used to establish a pan-European Forensic Substance Database on Explosives. In this work, three analytical techniques were employed to analyze 36 samples of commercial and military explosives from Germany and Switzerland. An HPLC-HRMS method was developed, using 27 analytes of interest that encompass high-energy compounds, synthesis by-products and additives. HPLC-HRMS and XRD were used to gather and confirm molecular information on each sample and XRF analyses were carried out to gain insight on the elemental composition. Combining the results from all three techniques, 41 different additives could be identified as being diagnostic analytes and all samples showed a unique analytical fingerprint, which allows for a differentiation of the samples. Therefore, this work presents a set of methods that can be used as a foundation for the creation and population of a database on explosives that enables the assigning of specific formulations to certain brands, manufacturers and countries of origin. © 2020","2-s2.0-85079123055"

The technique has been combined with optical emission detection schemes to evaluate energy release during detonation and post-detonation timescales from the combustion of metal powders and mixtures of metal powders and explosives. Recently, Al/Zr reactive composite powders have been synthesized via high energy ball milling with the aim of decreasing ignition thresholds while simultaneously increasing overall combustion efficiency and burn time. Here, we utilize LASEM to evaluate micron-sized 3Al:2Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr fuel powders and compare their behavior to micron-sized Al powder, a commonly used explosive additive. We observed a rapid ignition of Al/Zr powders instead of the delayed ignition of the secondary deflagration cloud that is observed for pure Al. The composites also demonstrated longer burn times compared to Al particles of similar size. We also observed enhanced laser-induced shock velocities for the composite samples, implying increased energy release in the microsecond time regime compared to Al. In addition, we present LASEM data using Al/Zr mixed with trinitrotoluene (TNT), and associated CHEETAH calculations. As expected, adding pure Al to TNT lowers the laser-induced shock velocity, and we observe a further decrease of this velocity when using composite additives.

Finally, ion-sputtering of Ag-nanoparticles (NPs) onto the ZnO MNSs was performed.

Accurate quantification of the tri-nitrated byproduct erythritol trinitrate (ETriN) was achieved by in-lab production of an ETriN standard and using custom-made standards of the two isomers of ETriN (1,2,3-ETriN and 1,2,4-ETriN). Large differences in levels of ETriN were observed between the two sample sets showing that, even when similar synthesis routes are employed, batches from different production locations can contain different impurity profiles. In one of the sample sets the ratios of the lesser partially nitrated impurities, EDiN and EMN, in the ETN samples could be determined. The impurity profiles enable prediction of post-synthesis work-up steps by reduction of the level of partially nitrated products upon recrystallization. However, impurity analysis does not enable predictions with respect to raw material or synthesis route used. Nonetheless, characteristic impurity profiles obtained can be used in forensic casework to differentiate or link ETN samples. However, forensic interpretation can be complicated by acid catalyzed degradation which can cause changes in impurity levels over time.

A thermal desorber and a multicapillary gas chromatography (GC) column are coupled to a secondary electrospray (SESI) ion source, so the adsorption sampling filters are thermally desorbed and the liberated vapors are separated in the GC column, prior to their ionization and mobility/mobility classification. The new fragmenter allows the fragmentation of the five explosives studied: RDX, PETN, NG, EGDN, and TNT.

An atmospheric background of only 2.5 pg (5 ppq) is found for TNT, being somewhat higher for the rest of explosives studied. The architecture GC-IMS2 is compared with GC-IMS obtaining a 100-fold increase of sensitivity in the first configuration, confirming the high selectivity provided by the fragmentation cell and the second IMS stage for the product ion mobility analysis.

Here, we report the development of a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based sensor system for highly sensitive detection of nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs). The sensor system is composed of a copolymer poly[(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-co-(Boc-Trp-EMA)] (RP) bearing tryptophan derivative in the side chain as donor and carbazole (CZ) as an acceptor. Primarily, the fluorescence of RP copolymer is quenched by non-radiative energy transfer to CZ which only happens once the two molecules are within Förster critical distance. The efficiency and rate of energy transfer process were calculated for this deliberated FRET system. This FRET pair exhibited a specific fluorescence response to NACs such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with 6.4, 5.9 and 1.4 μM limit of detections (LODs), respectively. Interestingly, the order of sensitivities of the FRET pair to NACs was very high. The sensing process occurs through a static and dynamic quenching pathway, confirmed by Stern−Volmer analysis of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence as well as UV–Vis Spectroscopy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85078760197"

Propagation limits are also of great significance for developing new-concept detonation engines. Due to the complex phenomena of near-limit detonation and the multiple competing mechanisms between the properties of mixtures and boundary conditions, development of a universal theoretical prediction model that can satisfactorily estimate the detonation velocity deficit (the difference between the actual detonation velocity and the theoretical CJ detonation velocity) near the limits is still extremely challenging. This work focuses on the essential relation between the detonation structure and prediction models. By analyzing the chemical length scales in the detonation structure of the ZND model, it is found that ΔI (induction length) and ΔR (exothermic length) are important length scales and that they are related to the reaction zone thickness (x) by: x = C·(ΔI + α·ΔR). In combination with Fay's boundary layer theory, a modified theoretical prediction model (MF) is proposed. The MF model is also compared with previous Fay models and experimental results. To verify the reliability of the MF model, three combustion mixtures (CH4-2O2, 2H2-O2 and C2H4-6N2O) and tubes with three different inner diameters (d = 36, 14 and 4 mm) are investigated. The results show that the MF model satisfactorily predicts the detonation deficit at the near-limit conditions. In the macroscale tube (d = 36 mm), the maximum difference with the experiment data is 9.3%. In the microscale tube (d = 4 mm), the maximum difference is 10.7%. If experimental measurement error is considered, the prediction of the MF model has reasonable accuracy. The results confirm that the detonation structure has an important impact on detonation limit predictions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85071933475"

For in-field detection of explosives, the devices should be portable and inexpensive and, at the same time, offer fast response and high sensitivity. Optical waveguide sensor is one of the most promsing platforms to realize on-chip nitroaromatics detection due to their capability of large-scale integration, high sensitivity, and immunity to electronmagnetic interference. Meanwhile, polymeric waveguide materials are inexpensive and highly flexible for functionalization. In this study, we synthesize a functional polycarbonate with side-chain donor-π-acceptor dipolar chromophores, and design and fabricate an all-polymer waveguide sensor for the detection of nitrobenzene (NB) and 2, 4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) vapors. The waveguide sensor is based on an unbalanced Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with two different arms coated with the synthesized polycarbonate. The phase difference between the two arms of the MZI is modulated by the refractive-index change of the coating, which originates from the interaction between dipolar chromophores and electron-deficient NB or DNT vapor in polycarbonate. Our fabricated sensor can reversibly detect NB vapor up to its equilibrium concentration in air (∼300 ppm) with a maximum wavelength shift larger than 8 nm. It can irreversibly detect DNT at a much lower concentration (ppb level) with a maximum wavelength shift larger than 5 nm. The response time of the sensor is shorter than 100 s.

The result shows that the addition of zirconium leads to the formation of a special structure inside the powder, promoting the oxidation of ZrAl3/Al composite fuels. Besides, non-selective oxidation of ZrAl3 played an important role in promoting the oxidation process. The oxygen bomb experiment was conducted to evaluate the combustion performance of ZrAl3/Al composite fuels. Oxygen bomb experiments show that the gravimetric combustion enthalpy of the composite fuels decreases linearly with the increase of zirconium content, and increases with the increase of oxygen partial pressure. However, the volumetric combustion enthalpy decreases first and then increases with the increase of zirconium content, and shows a general upward trend when the partial pressure of oxygen reaches 2.5 MPa or more.

The proposal of this work is to provide a survey of some luminescent sensors, addressing their quenching mechanisms and the misconceptions related to them. In addition, these sensors were tested for forensic screening to see if they are suitable for primary detection of explosives in cases of suspicion of explosive handling. For this purpose, three luminescent sensors, which have been claimed to be selective and have PET, were tested and used as probes: amine capped CDot (1S), [Eu2(BDC)3(H2O)2]·(H2O)2 (2S), and [Tb(BTC)]n (3S). UV/vis and time-dependent measurements, as well as corrected Stern Volmer plots, were used to demonstrate that the PET is not the main quenching mechanism in the 1S.

Finally, the suitability of these sensors for use in a screening test to detect explosives was evaluated, where false positive results are not desirable.

After successfully separating and detecting eight explosives via liquid analysis, three explosives were chosen as targets for the vapour analysis experiments. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene (TNB), 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-Trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (Tetryl) were successfully separated, detected and identified following the vapour extraction of explosive standards onto filter paper chads. Limits of detection for the liquid analysis were demonstrated to be 2.32 ng for TNB, 2.35 ng for Tetryl, and 3.25 ng for TNT. The minimum detectable mass found for the vapour analysis was 6.03 for TNB, 9.99 ng for TNT, and 14.22 ng for Tetryl. The average recovery from the paper chads was 29% for Tetryl, 47% for TNB, and 75% for TNT (n = 4), comparable with findings from previous studies. Results show that a minimum temperature of 40 °C is necessary to vaporize the compounds using acetone, while the best results were achieved when heating the vial to 80 °C. The use of a filter paper to collect the explosives residues, avoiding any additional extraction step, and the ability to analyze these compounds using a LOC instrument, makes this approach a future alternative method for explosive residues detection in the headspace. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85066783991"

In this study, we present a ratiometric sensor array for detection and discrimination of widely-used nitroaromatics (i.e., 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT)). In the design of sensor elements (SE) we employ blue emissive carbon dots (BCDs) in combination with yellow (SE-A) and red (SE-B) emissive cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs). The fluorescence intensity of BCDs, YQDs, and RQDs is quenched by TNT, DNT, and TNP in various degrees. Both TNT and TNP cause the quenching and spectral shift of BCDs (TNT causes a blueshift and TNP causes a redshift). However, DNT has no effect on CDs emission. The developed double-emitter sensor array is capable of discriminating nitroaromatics in the concentration range of 5.0–200.0 μmol L−1 with a limit of quantification as low as 5.0 μmol L−1. In addition, the sensor array demonstrates a promising capacity to detect structurally similar nitroaromatics in mixtures and complex media of soil and groundwater samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85064092757"

The results show that the HMX crystal surfaces are significantly stabilized by electrostatic adsorption between nitro-O and HTPB-H (both for alkyl and hydroxyl H). The corresponding electronic structure has an obvious modification, with some impurity states derived from HTPB in the forbidden band area. The initial reaction energy barrier may be reduced due to the extra active electron, but the earliest reaction sites of HMX thermal decomposition are not considerably changed. The thermal dissociation of HMX is mainly initiated with the breaking of the C-N bond, which is followed by NO2 elimination and alkyl dehydrogenation. After that, many HTPB-Hs are transferred to nitro-O to form water molecules, resulting in a delay of carbon and hydrogen oxidation of HMX. More intriguingly, the carbon chains of HTPB display considerable stability. Most of them even keep their original carbon backbone, which would act as an initial carbon nucleus and promote the carbon aggregation of small molecular residues. The presence of the HTPB binder should retard the reaction progress and reduce the reaction intensity of the HMX thermal decomposition. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85073210307"

To address this challenge, several non-detonable canine training aids have been designed for canine training. Bulk HMTD has a complex headspace, as shown by previous studies. This makes it a difficult odor to mimic and, in turn, makes evaluations and comparison of such training aids essential. In this work, five non-detonable HMTD canine training aids that are either commercially available or under development were evaluated with the goal of determining which most accurately represents the headspace of bulk HMTD. Of the five training aids, two were observed to reasonably mimic HMTD.

The energy characteristic of CL-20/RDX-CMDB propellants had also been calculated theoretically based on the principle of minimum free energy. The energy property of propellants with CL-20 was found to be evidently enhanced in comparison to those propellants containing RDX. The findings on combustion properties revealed that the combustion properties of CL-20-CMDB propellants were contrary to the of RDX-CMDB propellants. With the mass fraction of CL-20 increasing in the propellants, the burning rates of propellants can be enhanced significantly, but the burning rates of propellants containing RDX decreased. Analysis of the combustion residues for CL-20/RDX-CMDB propellants revealed that the C, Cu and Pb elements aggregated on combustion surface, which may be useful for guiding the regulation of combustion performance of high-performance CMDB propellants containing CL-20. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Furthermore, for the multicomponent insensitive explosive PBXC10 (70% TATB, 25% HMX, and 5% Kel-F800 by weight) with different explosive particle sizes, both shock initiation experiments and corresponding numerical simulations are performed, and there is satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and the available experimental data.

Two techniques for deposition of receptor layers were compared: Airbrush technology and electrospray ionization. A concentration of less than 5 ppb for TNT in the gas-phase, using electrospray deposition of the receptor layer, was detected. The cross-sensitivities to organic substances and further nitro-based explosives were compared. As a result, the sensitivity to TNT is about one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the explosives 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) or 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) and about four orders of magnitude higher than the organic substances phenol, ethanol, and acetone. The signal response of the sensor is fast, and the compact sensor design enables the deposition of different receptor layers on multiple optical micro-rings on one chip, which allows a more precise analysis and reduction of side effects and false alarms. © 2019 by the authors.

NGu based formulations are superior to those based on FOX-12 or TATB and are a close match with FOX-7 based explosives, the latter just having higher Gurney Energies (∼10%) and slightly higher detonation pressure (+2%). NGu based explosives even reach up to 78% of the detonation pressure, 82% Gurney energy and up to 95% of detonation velocity of HMX.

Quantification of total heat released and heat flow with aging time was conducted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal activity monitoring (TAMIII) respectively.

Herein, urea-functionalized poly(ionic liquid) photonic spheres were employed to construct a brand-new colorimetric sensor array for directly identifying five nitroaromatic explosives with a smartphone. It is found that the strong hydrogen bonding between the urea motifs and the nitro groups offers the spheres high affinity for binding the targets, whereas the existence of other abundant intermolecular interactions in poly(ionic liquid) units renders one single sphere eligible for prominent cross-responses to a broad range of analytes.

The energy characteristic data of TKX-50 are commonly generated via theoretical simulation and experimental measurements. Interestingly, the detonation velocity of TKX-50 is higher than HMX, but the specific kinetic energy of TKX-50 is the opposite. Thus, a systematic study on the decomposition mechanism of TKX-50 is important to establish the reasons for this variation in specific kinetic energy. Although the thermal decomposition mechanism of TKX-50 has been reported, the specific compositional changes of its gas products under different heating conditions remain unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism from the perspective of gas products. Herein, the gas products of TKX-50 and HMX in thermal decomposition and thermal explosion are investigated and compared. It was found that more TKX-50 is converted to ABTOX for further decomposition when the heating rate increases. ABTOX can decompose to C2N2, which is prone to polymerization, generating a solid residue under high temperature and pressure. Although polymerized C2N2 decomposes and burns during the explosion, it delays the time of TKX-50 reaching its maximum amount of outgassing, thereby affecting its specific kinetic energy. Furthermore, in the thermal explosion, compared with HMX, TKX-50 generates less H2 and CO. Since the combustion heat of hydrogen is much higher than that of carbon, the more hydrogen generated, the higher the detonation heat obtained. Therefore, TKX-50 has a lower detonation heat, which also affects its specific kinetic energy. © 2019 the Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-85063264113"

They are able to convert chemical energy into mechanical motion in their surrounding environment. Herein, a powerful, efficient and fast strategy of using nanosized reduced graphene oxide flake (n-rGO)-based self-propelled tubular micromachines for the removal of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) is described. This method relies on the integration of the rGO as a well-known adsorbent of aromatic compounds with chemically powered engines for the removal of explosive compounds such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Nanographene oxide reduced electrochemically inside the pores of the polycarbonate membrane to form an outer layer (n-rGO, adsorbent layer) of the micromachines. Subsequent electrodeposition of nickel (Ni, magnetic layer) and platinum (Pt, catalytic layer) resulted in the formation of n-rGO/Ni/Pt micromachines. Notably, the bubble-propelled micromachines were able to remove nitroaromatic compounds with high efficiency (∼90-92%) compared to the efficiency of magnetic-guided (22-42%) and static (2.5-7%) micromachines. Most importantly, the micromachines were regenerated and reused several times. The regeneration is based on an electrochemical method in which electron injection into the machine causes the expulsion of contaminants from the outer layer of the micromachines within a few seconds.

However, accidental ignition leading to a deflagration, and even detonation, may occur during manufacturing, handling and transport. Understanding how ignition depends on microstructural features, such as cracks and voids in the particles, and on the adhesive and mechanical properties of the binder through predictive numerical simulations and modeling will help to improve safety. Finite element simulations and experiments of a single high energetic material particle embedded in polymer binders are performed to investigate the effect of the material properties of the binder and the particle surface properties, on damage and temperature at an impact velocity of 10 m/s. Particles with low and high quality surface properties, and two different binders are analyzed. The simulations with the lower stiffness binder do not show a significant increase in temperature after impact. A polymer with higher stiffness induces more particle damage under impact contributing to a larger temperature rise. Furthermore, high quality surface and higher adhesion strength induces larger stresses and increase the temperature rise. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85065439264"

The investigation and monitoring of large contaminated areas requires new detection methods since the established ones are expensive and time-consuming. Hence, we established a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS) method using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene as the matrix substance and an internal standard for quantification. Analyzing standard substances, we found specific signals for radical and fragment ions of different nitrotoluenes and nitrobenzenes with good reproducibility and detection limits down to 0.25 ng/μL. The analysis of soil sample extracts from a former production site showed clear signals for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and the primary degradation products aminodinitrotoluenes. Furthermore, quantification gave results comparable to those obtained by conventional liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The MALDI-TOF MS method has a comparatively lower reproducibility, with relative standard deviations of 6% to 20% for multiple measurements of standard solutions and soil sample extracts. Nevertheless, a comparison of both methods revealed the advantages of MALDI-TOF MS analysis of explosive-contaminated areas with regard to costs, time, and handling.

The pressure-time histories in PBXC03 (87 % HMX, 7 % TATB, and 6 % Viton by weight) and PBXC10 (25 % HMX, 70 % TATB, and 5 % Kel-F800 by weight) are calculated by using the new mesoscopic reaction rate model, and the numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the shock initiation and detonation behaviors of PBXC03 with the dominant component of HMX is mainly controlled by the hot-spot ignition. The subsequent combustion reacts fast once the hot-spot is ignited and shows an accelerated reaction characteristic. While, with the dominant component of insensitive TATB, the critical initiation pressure of PBXC10 is high enough to make almost saturated reactive hot spots just behind the precursory shock-wave front, and the shock initiation behavior is basically determined by the combustion reaction, which is characterized by a stable reaction due to the slow combustion-wave velocity. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Unfortunately, the detection of explosives still poses a largely unmet arduous analytical problem, making their detection an issue of burning immediacy and a massive current challenge in terms of research and development. Although numerous explosive detection approaches have been developed, these methods are usually time-consuming, require bulky equipment, tedious sample preparation, a trained operator, cannot be miniaturized, and lack the ability to perform automated real-time high-throughput analysis, strongly handicapping their mass deployment. Here, we present the first demonstration of the ""direct"" electrochemical approach for the sensitive, selective, and rapid vapor trace detection of TATP and HMTD, under ambient conditions, unaffected by the presence of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide species, down to concentrations lower than 10 ppb. The method is based on the use of Ag-nanoparticles-decorated carbon microfibers air-collecting electrodes (μCF), which allow for the selective direct detection of the organic peroxide explosives, through opening multiple redox routes, not existent in the undecorated carbon electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate the direct and rapid detection of TATP and HMTD explosive species from real-world air samples. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85064175538"

A conventional PTR-MS apparatus with reagent ions H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0, 1, 2) can be converted to an ammonia-assisted PTR-MS with reagent ions NH4+.The new method was introduced to detect triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosive material. Results showed that the sensitivity is enhanced more than 37 times compared with TATP detection using conventional PTR-MS and the limit of detection (LOD) could reach 1.3 ppb. TATP in real complex matrixes can also be detected successfully using this method. Compared to conventional PTR-MS, ammonia-assisted PTR-MS has better sensitivity and better LOD for TATP detection, and the technique provides common users with a convenient and quick method to change reagent ions.

Upon exposure to sunlight, TNT is known to undergo both oxidation and reduction reactions with release of nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ions, followed by condensation reactions of the oxidation and reduction products. In this study, compound classes of transformation products from the aqueous and solid phase photodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have been identified by liquid and solid state 13C and 15N NMR. Aqueous phase experiments were performed on saturated solutions of T15NT in deionized water, natural pond water (pH = 8.3, DOC = 3.0 mg/L), pH 8.0 buffer solution, and in the presence of Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM; pH = 3.7), using a Pyrex-filtered medium pressure mercury lamp. Natural sunlight irradiations were performed on TNT in the solid phase and dissolved in the pond water. In deionized water, carboxylic acid, aldehyde, aromatic amine, primary amide, azoxy, nitrosophenol, and azo compounds were formed. 15N NMR spectra exhibited major peaks centered at 128 to 138 ppm, which are in the range of phenylhydroxylamine and secondary amide nitrogens. The secondary amides are proposed to represent benzanilides, which would arise from photochemical rearrangement of nitrones formed from the condensation of benzaldehyde and phenylhydroxylamine derivatives of TNT. The same compound classes were formed from sunlight irradiation of TNT in the solid phase. Whereas carboxylic acids, aldehydes, aromatic amines, phenylhydroxylamines, and amides were also formed from irradiation of TNT in pond water and in pH 8 buffer solution, azoxy and azo compound formation was inhibited. Solid state 15N NMR spectra of photolysates from the lamp irradiation of unlabeled 2,6-dinitrotoluene in deionized water also demonstrated the formation of aromatic amine, phenylhydroxylamine/ 2 amide, azoxy, and azo nitrogens.

For solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry-based methods (LC-HRMS), interferences from co-extracted matrix components can significantly affect recovery during extraction and/or detector signal. The aim of this work was to develop a new, improved and more generalisable extraction approach to trace explosives analysis in a range of matrices using dual-sorbent SPE with LC-HRMS. Recoveries of 44 organic explosives from model solutions were optimised and compared for seven different sorbents (Oasis HLB, HyperSep Retain PEP and Isolute ENV+, HyperSep SAX, HyperSep NH2, Strata Alumina-N and Bond Elut CN). On average, Oasis HLB and Isolute ENV+ yielded the best recoveries (>80%). For three sorbents, mean recoveries remained ≤1%, which made them potentially suitable for matrix removal when used in series with more analyte-selective sorbents. To evaluate matrix effects, a range of aqueous (river- and wastewater), solid (soil), dirty (road sign swabs), oily (oven hood swabs) and biological (dried blood) samples were selected based on complexity and forensic relevance. With the exception of river water, matrix effects were lowest using dual-sorbent SPE, with little/no compromise in recovery. Quantitative method performance assessment is presented for 14 selected explosives, representative of different classes, molecular weights and volatilities, and across three different matrices (i.e. untreated wastewater, cooking oil residues and dried blood). Limits of detection improved by ∼10-fold over a single sorbent approach, enabling low fg sensitivity in many cases. Finally, application of the method to untreated wastewater enabled detection of new explosives traces for the first time, which could be used to help identify clandestine manufacture or sources of environmental toxicity. This approach offered a versatile solution to sample preparation for robust and highly sensitive detection/quantification of large numbers of explosives residues in a range of complex sample types. © 2019 The Authors","2-s2.0-85065711797"

The 3D printing, especially the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method, has previously been utilized to fabricate carbon/polylactic acid (PLA) electrodes for electrochemical setups. Such electrodes require activation from their pristine state for improved conductivity, so far achieved by chemical treatment. Herein, a new simple physical thermal annealing method to activate graphene-based PLA electrodes is presented.

This study is part of the extensive historical and technical investigations performed since 1995 by Swiss authorities to provide a risk assessment. It aims to assess whether explosive monitoring by passive sampling is feasible in lake-bottom waters. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and Chemcatcher were first calibrated in a channel system supplied with continuously refreshed lake water spiked with two nitroamines (HMX and RDX), one nitrate ester (PETN), and six nitroaromatics (including TNT). Exposure parameters were kept as close as possible to the ones expected at the bottom of two affected lakes. Sixteen POCIS and Chemcatcher were simultaneously deployed in the channel system and removed in duplicates at 8 different intervals over 21 days. Sorbents and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes were separately extracted and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. When possible, a three-compartment model was used to describe the uptake of compounds from water, over the PES membrane into the sorbent. Uptake of target compounds by sorbents was shown not to approach equilibrium during 21 days. However, nitroaromatics strongly accumulated in PES, thus delaying the transfer of these compounds to sorbents (lag-phase up to 9 days). Whereas sampling rate (RS) of nitroamines were in the range of 0.06–0.14 L day−1, RS of nitroaromatics were up to 10 times lower. As nitroaromatic accumulation in PES was integrative over 21 days, PES was used as receiving phase for these compounds. The samplers were then deployed at lake bottoms.

The performance of both cocrystals is better than those of TNT. Thermal performance suggests that both the cocrystals have moderate thermal stabilities. Cocrystal 1 decomposes at 164.9 °C and cocrystal 2 has an exothermic peak at 221 °C. Both cocrystals are insensitive energetic explosives (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N). Methylimidazole compounds are rarely used as coformers to form cocrystals with CL-20, which possess good properties for a range of potential applications.

This paper discusses the TNT equivalence concept for bare charges using Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). At first, a review of different methods to derive TNT equivalence factors is given. After that, numerical simulations are conducted in order to obtain overpressure and impulse data, which is fitted by using the curve-fitting method. Meanwhile, the equations representing the fitted curves of peak overpressures and maximum impulses are employed to calculate the TNT equivalence factors for overpressure and impulse, respectively. Fitting these data, formulae are developed to calculate the TNT equivalence factors of PETN for overpressure and impulse. It is found that a single value, i.e. 1.258 for overpressure and 1.272 for impulse, can be used to convert the charge mass of PETN to TNT in the far field. This statement is confirmed by a series of free field air blast measurements. However, the TNT equivalence factors of PETN vary significantly in the near field.

The gas pressure depends on the amount of the released energy, including the afterburning energy. A new analytical model is presented to predict the gas pressure developed in a confined volume, for different types of explosives, as function of the charge weight (W) and the free confined volume (V), considering the afterburning effect. The model is based on the detonation chemical reaction and on the calculation of a full or partial afterburning energy release due to the reaction of the fuels in the detonation products with the surrounding oxygen. Considering the detonation energy and the possible additional afterburning energy, the model demonstrates the different behavior of the gas pressure variation with W/V for different types of explosives. The equivalent TNT charge weight is calculated for each explosive. According to the analysis performed, the TNT equivalent factor varies with W/V.

The results showed that the critical thickness decreased significantly with increasing RDX contents, and the detonation velocity at the critical thickness was almost unchanged for the different RDX contents.

This new method incorporated ethanolic eluents to facilitate direct coupling of IC and HRMS without auxiliary post-column infusion pumps that are traditionally used to assist with gas phase transfer. Ethanolic eluents also enabled better integration with an in-service protocol for direct analysis of high-order organic explosives by IC-HRMS, without requiring solvent exchange before injection. Excellent method performance was achieved, enabling both full scan qualitative and quantitative analysis, as required. In particular, linearity for 19 targeted compounds yielded R2 > 0.99 across several orders of magnitude, with trace analysis possible at the low-mid pg level. Reproducibility and mass accuracies were also excellent, with peak area %RSDs <10%, tR %RSDs <0.4% and δm/z < 3 ppm. The method was applied to targeted analysis of latent fingermarks and swabbed hand sweat samples to determine contact with a black-powder substitute containing nitrate, benzoate and perchlorate.

An additional 20 markers of GSR were tentatively identified in silico, in addition to the 15 anions detected during targeted analysis. This new approach therefore streamlines and adds consistency and flexibility to forensic analysis of ionic energetic material.

The quenching efficiency of the nanoaggregates can be ascribed to a combination of factors including efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer, inner filter effect and coulombic interaction between picric acid and the aggregated probe molecules. Further, random aggregation of the pyrene derivative could be controlled for the formation of fluorescent spherical nanoparticles using Pluoronics P-123 block copolymers as encapsulating agents.

The effectiveness, ignition energy as well as spark sensitivity of these explosives are governed by the velocity of detonation which needs to be determined before energetic material synthesis purposely to enhance safety and lessen the cost as well as the difficulties associated with material synthesis and evaluation. This present research work proposes hybridization of support vector regression (SVR) and genetic algorithm (GA) for estimation of the velocities of primary explosives for the first time. The performance of the proposed hybrid SVR-GA is compared with the existing Mohammad Jafari et al. model as well as the results of EXPLO5Code's prediction using four parameters for measuring model's performance. The proposed SVR-GA model shows superior performance compared with two existing models in the literature. The performance of the proposed SVR-GA model for explosive velocity estimation strengthens its practical application, circumvents the experimental challenges and minimizes the associated potential risk. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Considering the harsh environment in the explosion field, the acquisition of fireball temperature depends mainly on the radiation temperature measurement method. The content of research on radiation temperature measurement in the explosion field includes two main points, namely, (1) how to measure the fireball radiation energy accurately and (2) how to convert the measured radiation energy into fireball temperature accurately. Theoretical studies on infrared temperature measurement in the explosion field are scarce. No theory is suitable for modifying fireball temperatures measured by IR system.A temperature compensation formula is proposed based on geometrical optics and infrared radiation theory in this study to eliminate the measurement error of radiation energy caused by the test environment. The principle of the influence of distance and meteorological conditions on measurement accuracy is analyzed. After eliminating the temperature error, image gray level is introduced as an intermediate variable, and the temperature compensation relationship is derived based on error transfer theory. Subsequently, the correctness of the theory is verified through simulation experiments. The measured temperature of 3 Kg of HMX mixing powder is compensated for and corrected.

This ability is thought to be the product of both genetic and behavioural selection, allowing dogs to adapt to life with humans. Dogs' responsiveness to human gestures can also lead to suboptimal choices when dogs readily follow misleading cues despite directly contradicting perceptual information such as odour cues. However, this bias likely reflects pet dogs' enculturation with humans and thus may not be representative of other populations of dogs. We investigated the ability of young dogs in training for explosives detection (N = 77) to locate a hidden reward using olfactory cues when presented in conflict with a deceptive communicative gesture in an object-choice task. We assessed performance at 3, 6 and 11 months of age using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. We found that, contrary to previous findings with pet dogs, responsiveness to human pointing decreased with age, whereas the ability to locate the reward by scent increased. Furthermore, a lack of susceptibility to deceptive social cues was predictive of future success as a detection dog. These findings further indicate the influence of ontogenetic effects on canine social cognition and demonstrate potential applications for the identification of suitable detection dogs. © 2019","2-s2.0-85066397328"

Analysis of time-resolved transmission and emission at a 2 μs sampling rate shows the evolution of fireball infrared opacity in the first 10 ms after detonation.
