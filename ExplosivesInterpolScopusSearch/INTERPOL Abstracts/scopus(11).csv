In our experiment, a mid-infrared QCL with emission wavelength near 7.35 ?m was used as a laser source. Direct standoff PA detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) was achieved using an ultrasensitive microphone. The QCL output light was focused on explosive samples in powder form. PA signals were generated and detected directly by an ultrasensitive low-noise microphone with 1 in. diameter. A detection distance up to 8 in. was obtained using the microphone alone.With increasing detection distance, the measured PA signal not only decayed in amplitude but also presented phase delays, which clearly verified the source location. To further increase the detection distance, a parabolic sound reflector was used for effective sound collection. With the help of the sound reflector, standoff PA detection of TNT with distance of 8 ft was demonstrated. © 2013 Optical Society of America.","2-s2.0-84876532706"

An electrodeposited nanogold substrate was functionalised by deposition of self-assembled monolayers of 2-aminoethanethiol as linkers for the subsequent immobilisation of polyamidoaminic dendrimers. Our approach makes use of those dendrimers to anchor a trinitrobenzene-ovalbumin conjugate on the electrode surface. The immunosensor was tested and validated for the determination of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene showing high selectivity with respect to other nitroaromatic compounds, a limit of detection of 4.8 ng/mL and a limit of quantitation of 6 ng/mL. The immunosensor was tested for the quantification of the analyte in spiked soils and in a real sample of post-blast soil, evidencing a good recovery rate (113 %).

This requires the development of highly sensitive, portable, and stand-off sensors. Here, we present a wireless sensing unit based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) integrated with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry, which can effectively detect trace explosives and chemical agents. The response of SWNT sensors to Dinitrotoluene (DNT) (a byproduct of TNT) and Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) (an analog of nerve agent sarin) vapors is improved dramatically after decoration with single stranded-DNA (ss-DNA). The response of carbon nanotube sensors to DNT and DMMP vapors is reversible and repeatable. The nanosensors integrated on a CMOS chip are tested with DMMP (DNT) vapors with concentrations varying from 1.57 to 130.49 ppm (9.41-45.73 ppm), and the corresponding change in resistance of the SWNT sensor varied from 7.5% to 27.5% (6.53-22.76%). The detected signal is processed by off-chip components on a circuitry board and is transmitted wirelessly to a computer. This versatile sensing system provides a promising platform to detect explosives and chemical agents at a trace level in a wireless manner and stand-off distance. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84872247899"

Molecular weight of the polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography. The polymers exhibit purely electronic conduction and was confirmed by Wagner polarization technique. Sensitivities of the polymers were observed by monitoring the impedance response and current-voltage characteristics in presence of the vapor of analytes. The conduction level of PCUMA in presence of the analytes was found to be remarkably high compared to that of PCUA.

In the analysis step, a temperature ramp desorbed the two explosives into an entraining Ar flow. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was applied to detect the plasma generated atomic and diatomic radicals using a spectrometer at atmospheric pressure. For both test species, the detection limits reached values lower than 5 ppb. The effect of an at-sea environment was also evaluated.

When disposed of, explosives can cause seawater pollution. The detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in seawater has been examined on two different forms of graphene, mainly graphene prepared from the unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and from the exfoliation of stacked graphene nanofibers (SGNFs).

However, the signal can be amplified by several orders of magnitude, leading to the so-called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) phenomenon. Basically, the SERS effect is achieved when the target molecule (analyte) is adsorbed onto metallic nanoparticles, usually noble metals. This article presents an overview of the applications of SERS to cancer diagnosis and the detection of pesticides, explosives, and drugs (illicit and pharmacological). SERS is routinely applied nowadays to detect and identify analytes at very low concentrations, including for single-molecule detection. However, the application of SERS as an analytical tool requires reliable and reproducible SERS substrates, in terms of enhancement factors, which depends on the size, shape, and aggregation of the metallic nanoparticles. Therefore, the production of reliable and reproducible SERS substrates is a challenge in the field. Besides, the metallic nanoparticles can also induce changes in the system by possible interactions with the analyte under investigation, which must be taken into account. This review will present work in which, under certain specific experimental conditions, SERS has been analytically applied.","2-s2.0-84877971634"

One method that offers a possible route for the development of a detection system for such species is via an electrochemical regime, coupled to the use of disposable sensor technology. Within this study, the use of carbon screen-printed sensors for the detection and analysis of the classical explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) and the related dinitrotoluene (DNT) is described, with the eventual objective to develop an inexpensive, accurate and sensitive detection system for trace quantities of explosives in field settings. Commercially available screen-printed carbon sensors have been used as the base platform for this investigation and the electrochemistry of both TNT and DNT studied at these surfaces. Two reductive peaks and one oxidative peak were observed for both analytes. The best linear fits and sensitivities were obtained using the reductive peak at −0.72 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A linear range from 1 to 200 μM could be obtained for TNT and DNT in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer with limits of detection as low as 0.4 μM (TNT) and 0.7 μM (DNT). A second system which utilised the addition of the enzyme, nitroreductase, and the coenzyme, NADPH, into the solution matrix prior to electrochemical interrogations with screen-printed carbon electrodes was found to increase the resulting signal magnitude at the oxidation peak at +0.3 V, improving the performance of the sensor at these values. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","2-s2.0-84876097830"

The data obtained from the electrochemical measurements can be used to build statistical models able to assess physicochemical properties of the samples. The designed system has been applied to the detection and quantification of trinitrotoluene (TNT), which is one of the most common explosive materials.

TiO2-(B) in the form of nanowires has been demonstrated to be a promising material for the detection of explosive gases such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). However, the elimination of cross-sensitivity of the explosive detectors based on TiO2-(B) toward environmental humidity is still a major challenge. It was found that the cross-sensitivity could be effectively modulated when the thin film of TiO 2-(B) nanowires was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light during the detection of explosives under operating conditions. Such a modulation of sensing responses of TiO2-(B) nanowires to explosives by UV light was attributed to a photocatalytic effect, with which the water adsorbed on the TiO2-(B) nanowire surface was split and therefore the sensor response performance was less affected. It was revealed that the cross-sensitivity could be suppressed up to 51% when exposed to UV light of 365 nm wavelength with an intensity of 40 mW cm-2.

A panel of purified fluorescent protein isoforms (FPs) was screened for the ability to detect various explosives, explosive simulants, and toxic agents. In addition to their commonly used visible excitation wavelengths, essentially all FPs can be excited by UV light at 280. nm. Ultraviolet illumination excites electrons in endogenous tryptophan (W) residues, which then relax by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to the chromophore of the FP, and thus the FPs emit with their typical visible spectra. Taking advantage of the fact that tryptophan excitation can be quenched by numerous agents, including nitroaromatics like TNT and nitramines like RDX, it is demonstrated that quenching of visible fluorescence from UV illumination of FPs can be used as the basis for detecting these explosives and explosive degradation products. This work provides the foundation for production of an array of genetically-modified FPs for in vitro biosensors capable of rapid, simultaneous, sensitive and selective detection of a wide range of explosive or toxic agents. © 2013.","2-s2.0-84878235430"

A separation of desorption and ionization processes could be verified. The use of the diode laser is motivated by its low cost, ease of use, and small size. To achieve an efficient desorption, the glass substrates are coated at the back side with a black point (target point, where the sample is deposited) in order to absorb the energy offered by the diode laser radiation. Subsequent ionization is accomplished by a helium plasmajet generated in the dielectric barrier discharge source. Examples on the application of this approach are shown in both positive and negative ionization modes. A wide variety of multiclass species with low vapor pressure were tested including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and explosives (reserpine, roxithromycin, propazine, prochloraz, spinosad, ampicillin, dicloxacillin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, spinosad, cyclo-1,3,5,7-tetramethylene tetranitrate (HMX), and cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene trinitramine (RDX)).

It is based on a commercially available screen printed cell with graphite ink working and auxiliary electrodes and a silver ink quasi-reference electrode. The whole cell is covered with a thick layer of cation exchanging acrylic polymer molecularly imprinted with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.

The selectivity for TNT relative to other reducible compounds as, for example, nitroaromatic derivatives, and to other possible interfering substances, as negatively charged ions, is good.

The microcalorimeter consists of a suspended micromembrane with integrated heaters and thermistors and a carbon nanotube (CNT) interface layer in-situ synthesized on the membrane surface. Due to the large surface areas, the CNT interface layer improves adsorption to target chemical molecules. By operating the microcalorimeter in differential scanning calorimetry mode and differential thermal analysis mode, trace chemical detection is achieved through heating the adsorbed chemicals to deflagration and measuring the induced thermal response features and the total heat. The microcalorimeter is verified by explosive detection, and an equivalent limit of detection of 2.6 pg has been achieved by extrapolating the measurement results. Theoretically, detection is distinguishable upon 10-s fast exposure to saturated explosive vapors.

To our knowledge this is the first time standoff deep Raman spectroscopy of concealed substances in highly fluorescing coloured packaging is demonstrated. Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, spatially offset Raman spectroscopy and time-resolved spatially offset Raman spectroscopy have been compared to identify their selectivity towards the deep layers of a sample. The selectivity of time-resolved Raman spectroscopy towards the concealed chemical substances was found to be comparable to that of spatially offset Raman spectroscopy. However, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy did not require precise translation of the laser excitation beam onto the surface of the interrogated packaging as in the case of spatially offset Raman spectroscopy. Our results confirm that standoff time-resolved spatially offset Raman spectroscopy has significantly higher selectivity towards the deep layers of a sample when compared to the other deep Raman spectroscopy modes. The developed spectrometer was capable of detecting the concealed substances within 5 s of data acquisition. By using time-resolved spatially Raman spectroscopy, a Raman spectrum that is representative of the content alone was acquired without the use of sophisticated algorithms to eliminate the spectral contributions of the packaging material within the acquired spectrum as in the case of time-resolved Raman spectroscopy and spatially offset Raman spectroscopy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nitromethane is an interesting target for detection due to its uses in artisanal explosive compositions and also for its carcinogenic characteristics. Several techniques including electrochemistry have been developed but require laboratory equipment, preparative steps or complex working electrodes. We here describe the development of a robust, simple and commercially available electrochemical detection system. Square wave voltammetry was used for this purpose with a gold working electrode and a phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. The limits of detection (LOD) were 2.3 μM without dissolved oxygen in the solution and 12.5 μM in air. Furthermore, a mechanistic investigation enabled us to confirm, under these conditions, a 4-electron reduction mechanism from nitromethane to N-methylhydroxylamine. However, under real conditions of use, N-methylhydroxylamine is not the sole product of the reduction reaction. Other products have been identified by nuclear magnetic resonance characterization and a reaction scheme was established. The system could be minimized for on-site measurements by using screen-printed electrodes with a portable potentiostat.

This nanostructuration is achieved by an accurate control of the parameters of a-two-steps synthesis. The first step consists of the deposition, by a magnetron sputtering method, of a thick and dense metallic titanium layer on the silicon microcantilever. In the second step, this layer is anodized to form the aligned titanium dioxide nanotubes array. The influences of the deposition speed on the titanium film quality and of the anodization parameters on the nanotubes formation are discussed.

Therefore, all aspects that had an influence on the formation of such an atmosphere had to be considered. The most important influencing factors were permeation, air change in the freight container and ambient temperature. The first step was to investigate the permeation with different packaging materials, charge and temperatures. Furthermore, the air change rates of different freight containers were measured. A few climate tests with containers on ships, e.g. to Singapore, were performed to assess normal conditions of carriage. Another important point was measuring the solvent (toluene) concentration in the gas phase in a freight container loaded with plastic intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) filled with toluene. To confirm that the measured values were in the right range, the toluene concentration in the gas phase in a container was calculated with different packaging materials, air change rates and temperatures. The results of the measurements and calculations have shown that safety layers in the packaging wall, e.g. the copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and polyamide, can reduce the rate of permeation by more than a decimal power, but the lower explosive limit of toluene is easily reached within a few hours at 40°C charge temperature if there is no barrier.

In this cell reference TATP - spectra were collected under controlled conditions with a Bruker FTIR system (Typ OPAG 33).

We constructed a special double - T shaped chamber with stabile air conditions. In this chamber the dispersion kinetics of the TATP vapour could be tested. It turned out that the TATP vapours has the tendency to drop down. Therefore the highest TATP - concentrations were measured below the TATP sample.

By heating the CNT networks with an integrated heater, the explosive vapors adsorbed on the CNT surfaces are ignited to deflagration, which releases extra heat to deflect the microcantilever and thus changes the resistance of an integrated piezoresistor. This thermal-mechanical coupling transduction mechanism bridges the heat changes on the CNT networks and the mechanical deflection of the microcantilever. The large surface to volume ratio of CNTs enables fast adsorption of the chemical sensor to explosive vapors and improved equivalent limit of detection (LOD).

In this paper we focused on the capabilities of the MCNPX code (Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended) to follow the particle transport in semiconductor detector of fast neutrons. Semiconductor detector based on semi-insulating GaAs was the object of our investigation. As converter material capable to produce charged particles from the (n, p) interaction, a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was employed. As the source of fast neutrons, the 239Pu-Be neutron source was used in the model. The simulations were performed using the MCNPX code which makes possible to track not only neutrons but also recoiled protons at all interesting energies. Hence, the MCNPX code enables seamless particle transport and no other computer program is needed to process the particle transport. The determination of the optimal thickness of the conversion layer and the minimum thickness of the active region of semiconductor detector as well as the energy spectra simulation were the principal goals of the computer modeling. Theoretical detector responses showed that the best detection efficiency can be achieved for 500 μm thick HDPE converter layer.

A developing market is the detection and identification of energetic compounds through analysis of the resulting absorption spectrum. This work presents a selection of results from a prototype mid-infrared (MWIR) hyperspectral imaging instrument that has successfully been used for compound detection at a range of standoff distances. Active hyperspectral imaging utilises a broadly tunable laser source to illuminate the scene with light over a range of wavelengths. While there are a number of illumination methods, this work illuminates the scene by raster scanning the laser beam using a pair of galvanometric mirrors. The resulting backscattered light from the scene is collected by the same mirrors and directed and focussed onto a suitable single-point detector, where the image is constructed pixel by pixel. The imaging instrument that was developed in this work is based around a MWIR optical parametric oscillator (OPO) source with broad tunability, operating at 2.6 μm to 3.7 μm. Due to material handling procedures associated with explosive compounds, experimental work was undertaken initially using simulant compounds. A second set of compounds that was tested alongside the simulant compounds is a range of confusion compounds. By having the broad wavelength tunability of the OPO, extended absorption spectra of the compounds could be obtained to aid in compound identification. The prototype imager instrument has successfully been used to record the absorption spectra for a range of compounds from the simulant and confusion sets and current work is now investigating actual explosive compounds. The authors see a very promising outlook for the MWIR hyperspectral imager.

The large surface area-to-volume ratio and hence good gas accessibility endow the porphyrinated nanofibers with much more remarkable fluorescent quenching behavior toward trace TNT vapor than its spin-coating dense film counterparter.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been demonstrated to be an effective analytical technique for the detection and characterization of energetic materials. However, the major obstacle in the identification of explosives is their elevated spectral similarity with those compounds that share an analogous elemental composition. Despite that a number of different chemometric methods have been developed in the past for the detection of explosives, this hurdle remains latent today. Our recent efforts have been focused on the use of an alternative chemometric approach for improving the sensitivity and selectivity of LIBS for residue explosives identification. Through the survey of the spectral responses from the analysis of a variety of organic residues (either explosive or potential confusant materials) located on the surface of a support, relationships between the optical emission behaviors of residues and their corresponding hazardous nature have been extracted. By using the original intensities of the most relevant emission signals (C:CN:C2:H:N:O) properly projected onto 2D subspaces, different machine learning classifiers have been designed and trained. This approach has been demonstrated to be capable for the identification of organic explosive residues against several potential confusant materials when they are placed on the surface of an aluminum support. False positive and false negative rates better than 5% are achieved.

Six sensing materials have been prepared, of which SP, SD, SF were hydrophilic and SPh, SDh, SFh were hydrophobic. Template-free hydrophilic materials (SP, SD, SF) were obtained after repeated NH4NO3/ethanol extractions under temperature from as-synthesised (MP, MD and MF supports, respectively) solids. Hydrophobic materials (SPh, SDh, SFh) were prepared by using excess 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane with template-free hydrophilic (SP, SD and SF) materials.

SD and SDh exhibit the broad dansyl fluorescence band in the 450-600 nm range, whereas solids SF and SFh present sharp fluorescein emission centred at 525 nm.

Only nitroaromatic compounds were able to induce emission quenching. As a general trend, the quenching degree depended on the nature of the final material. The best response was obtained with explosives PA and Tetryl, which were able to significantly quench the emission of the sensing supports. The observed quenching was ascribed to the π-π stacking interactions between the electron-donor fluorophores and the electron-withdrawing nitroaromatic explosives. When using SPh for Tetryl and PA, the limits of detection were 8.5 and 1.4 ppm, respectively, whereas they were 14.4 and 1.2 ppm for SDh. Principal component analysis algorithms were applied to the fluorescence measurements taken with the six hybrid materials and the seven explosives.

To achieve a higher sample throughput, the electrochemical sensor was adapted in a flow injection system. Under optimal experimental conditions, the peak current response increases linearly with picric acid concentration over the range of 20-300 μmol L-1. The repeatability of the electrode response in the flow injection analysis (FIA) configuration was evaluated as 3% (n=10), and the detection limit of the method was estimated to be 6.0 μmol L-1 (S/N=3). The sample throughput under optimised conditions was estimated to be 550 samples h-1. Peroxide explosives like triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) were tested as potential interfering substances for the proposed method, and no significant interference by these explosives was noticed. The proposed method has interesting analytical parameters, environmental applications, and low cost compared with other electroanalytical methods that have been reported for the quantification of picric acid.

The former was used to detect the aromatic amines, and the protonated analytes generated were selected for the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The false-positive signals were excluded by tandem mass spectrometry. For the 6 analytes, linear signal responses were obtained, and each had a dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude.

This paper proposes an alternative: photoneutron spectroscopy using monoenergetic gamma rays. If monoenergetic gamma rays whose energies exceed the threshold for neutron production are incident on a given isotope, the emitted neutrons have a spectrum consisting of one or more discrete energies and the spectrum can be used as a fingerprint to identify the isotope. A prototype compact gamma-ray generator is proposed as a suitable source and a commercially available 3He ionization chamber is proposed as a suitable spectrometer. Advantages of the method with respect to the previously mentioned ones may include simpler spectra and low inherent natural neutron background. Its drawbacks include a present lack of suitable commercially available photon sources, induced neutron backgrounds and low detection rates.

Approaches to detect RDX compatible with remote, ""stand-off"" sampling that do not require preconcentration strategies, such as the swabs commonly employed in airports, will benefit military and civilian security. Such detection remains a significant challenge because RDX is 103 less volatile than 1,3,5-trinitrotoluene (TNT), corresponding to a parts-per-trillion vapor pressure under ambient conditions. Therefore, while fluorescence quenching of conjugated polymers is sufficiently sensitive to detect TNT vapors, RDX vapor detection is undemonstrated. Here we report a cross-linked phenylene vinylene polymer network whose fluorescence is quenched by trace amounts of RDX introduced from solution or the vapor phase. Fluorescence quenching is reduced, but remains significant, when partially degraded RDX is employed, suggesting that the polymer responds to RDX itself. The polymer network also responds to TNT and PETN similarly introduced from solution or the vapor phase. Pure solvents, volatile amines, and the outgassed vapors from lipstick or sunscreen do not quench polymer fluorescence.

However, despite of the high sensitivity exhibited for this application, LIBS suffers from a limited selectivity due to difficulties in assigning the molecular origin of the spectral emissions observed. This circumstance makes the recognition of fingerprints a latent challenging problem. In the present manuscript the sorting of six explosives (chloratite, ammonal, DNT, TNT, RDX and PETN) against a broad list of potential harmless interferents (butter, fuel oil, hand cream, olive oil, y), all of them in the form of fingerprints deposited on the surfaces of objects for courier services, has been carried out. When LIBS information is processed through a multi-stage architecture algorithm built from a suitable combination of 3 learning classifiers, an unknown fingerprint may be labeled into a particular class. Neural network classifiers trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt rule were decided within 3D scatter plots projected onto the subspace of the most useful features extracted from the LIBS spectra. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented algorithm sorts fingerprints according to their hazardous character, although its spectral information is virtually identical in appearance, with rates of false negatives and false positives not beyond of 10%.

Among them, we can list grain size and the fill rate for polycrystalline materials that both may significantly vary for a same material according to its way of production. Consequently, peak intensity may change significantly from one measurement to another one, thus increasing the risk of losing peaks. This instability is one of the many causes of false alarms.

The variety of targets, backgrounds and interferences increase the challenges. Infrared absorption spectroscopy with traditional infrared detection technologies, incandescent sources that offer broad wavelength range but poor spectral intensity, are particularly challenged in standoff applications because most photons are lost to the target, background and the environment. Using a brighter source for active infrared detection e.g. a widely-tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) source, provides sufficient spectral intensity to achieve the needed sensitivity and selectivity for explosives, CWAs, and TICs on surfaces. Specific detection of 1-10 μg/cm 2 is achieved within seconds. CWAs, and TICs in vapor and aerosol form present a different challenge. Vapors and aerosols are present at low concentrations, so long pathlengths are required to achieve the desired sensitivity. The collimated output beam from the QCL simplifies multi-reflection cells for vapor detection while also enabling large standoff distances. Results obtained by the QCL system indicate that <1 ppm for vapors can be achieved with specificity in a measurement time of seconds, and the QCL system was successfully able to detect agents in the presence of interferents. QCLs provide additional capabilities for the dismounted warfighter.

HMTD was prepared from hexamine using several different sources of hexamine under both controlled laboratory conditions and in field experiments that represent the less controlled conditions that are likely to be observed in forensic casework scenarios. Precursor and product carbon isotope δ values consistently fit a linear relationship regardless of precursor or conditions. The magnitude of the isotope fractionation observed is affected by the efficiency of the reaction, with greater yielding reactions giving rise to HMTD with δ values more similar to the precursor material than lower yielding reactions. Nitrogen isotope δ values comparing precursor with product show some linearity when the reaction conditions are carefully controlled; however, results indicate a poor fit with linearity when synthesis conditions are more variable. Despite the greater variation, the HMTD product consistently has a more positive δ value compared with the hexamine precursor. The results observed from these experiments suggest hexamine reacts to form HMTD in a 1:1 ratio.

The detection system provides continuous, real-time monitoring of particular vapor-phase analytes at concentrations of 1 ppb. The system is designed with a large free-surface-to-volume ratio microfluidic channel which allows for polar or hydrophilic airborne analytes to readily be partitioned from the surrounding gas phase into the aqueous phase for detection.

However, the reported fluorescence sensory materials (e.g., polymers) usually respond to a class of analytes (e.g., nitroaromatics), rather than a single specific target. Hence, the selective detection of trace amounts of trinitrotoluene (TNT) still remains a big challenge for fluorescence-based sensors. Here we report the selective detection of TNT vapor using the nanoporous fibers fabricated by self-assembly of carbazole-based macrocyclic molecules. The nanoporosity allows for time-dependent diffusion of TNT molecules inside the material, resulting in further fluorescence quenching of the material after removal from the TNT vapor source. Under the same testing conditions, other common nitroaromatic explosives and oxidizing reagents did not demonstrate this postexposure fluorescence quenching; rather, a recovery of fluorescence was observed. The postexposure fluorescence quenching as well as the sensitivity is further enhanced by lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the nanofiber building blocks. This in turn reduces the affinity for oxygen, thus allocating more interaction sites for TNT.

These dielectric-response functions provide the basis for analyses pertaining to the dielectric properties of explosives. In particular, these dielectric-response functions provide quantitative initial estimates of spectral-response features for subsequent adjustment with knowledge of additional information, such as laboratory measurements and other types of theory-based calculations. With respect to qualitative analyses, these spectra provide for the molecular-level interpretation of response structure.

IMS response for several common high explosives ranging from 0.1 ng to 100 ng was measured over a thermal desorber temperature range from 60 °C to 280 °C. Most of the explosives examined demonstrated a well-defined maximum IMS signal response at a temperature slightly below the melting point. Optimal temperatures, giving the highest IMS peak intensity, were 80 °C for trinitrotoluene (TNT), 100 °C for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 160 °C for cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and 200 °C for cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX). By modifying the desorber temperature, we were able to increase cumulative IMS signal by a factor of 5 for TNT and HMX, and by a factor of 10 for RDX and PETN. Similar signal enhancements were observed for the same compounds formulated as plastic-bonded explosives (Composition 4 (C-4), Detasheet, and Semtex). In addition, mixtures of the explosives exhibited similar enhancements in analyte peak intensities. The increases in sensitivity were obtained at the expense of increased analysis times of up to 20 seconds. A slow sample heating rate as well as slower vapor-phase analyte introduction rate caused by low-temperature desorption enhanced the analytical sensitivity of individual explosives, plastic-bonded explosives, and explosives mixtures by IMS. Several possible mechanisms that can affect IMS signal response were investigated such as thermal degradation of the analytes, ionization efficiency, competitive ionization from background, and aerosol emission. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","2-s2.0-84864268970"

The main difficulty for identification consists in fact that the mixtures have practically identical spectral properties both in the Stand-Off (reflection nearly at 90°) and Specular (reflection at 45°) mode. The presence of covering makes additional difficulties for identification because it distorts the spectral properties of the reflected THz signal.

Unfortunately, the production of high-quality antibodies is not trivial and often expensive. Therefore, excellent antibodies are a rare and limiting resource in fields such as biosensing, environmental analysis, diagnostics, cancer therapy, and proteomics. Here, we report the synthesis, bioconjugation, and application of the structurally optimized hapten 6-(2,4,6-trinitro)-phenylhexanoic acid to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of antibodies for the detection of one of the most important explosives, trinitrotoluene. With a conjugate of bovine serum albumin and a highly purified N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS)-activated hapten, two rabbits were immunized to obtain polyclonal antibodies. The immunization process was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to gain information about the progress of antibody titer and affinity. Finally, the polyclonal antibodies reached an affinity constant of (5.1 ± 0.6) × 10 9 l/mol (rabbit R1) and (2.3 ± 0.2) × 10 9 l/mol (rabbit R2). The respective assays show a minimum test midpoint (IC 50 value) of 0.1 ± 0.01 μg/l (R1) and 0.2 ± 0.02 μg/l (R2) and a working range of 0.005 to 150 μg/l (R1) and 0.007 to 200 μg/l (R2), which corresponds to more than four orders of magnitude for both. This is quite remarkable for a competitive immunoassay, which is often believed to have a narrow dynamic range. The limit of detection was calculated to 0.6 ng/l (R1) and 1.5 ng/l (R2), which is up to 100 times improvement in relation to the assay of Zeck et al. (1999) on the basis of a monoclonal antibody. The excellent selectivity of the polyclonal antibodies was comprehensively examined by determining the cross-reactivity to common explosives and other nitroaromatics including nitro musk components. The widely held belief that polyclonal antibodies generally display higher cross-reactivities than monoclonals could be disproved. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-84856433261"

Micrometer sized cantilevers are often used for label-free detection, and have previously been reported to be able to detect explosives. However, only a few measurements from 1 to 2 cantilevers have been reported, without any information on repeatability and reliability of the presented data. In explosive detection high reliability is needed and thus a statistical measurement approach needs to be developed and implemented. We have developed a DVD-based read-out system capable of generating large sets of cantilever data for vapor and liquid phase detection of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Gold coated cantilevers are initially functionalized with tetraTTF-calix[4]pyrrole molecules, specifically designed to bind nitro-aromatic compounds. The selective binding of DNT molecules on the chemically treated surfaces results in significant bending of the cantilevers and in a decrease of their resonant frequencies. We present averaged measurements obtained from up to 72 cantilevers being simultaneously exposed to the same sample.

The results of the experiments showed that azidodeoxy cellulose nitrate decomposes exothermally during three continuous steps at temperature range of 180-500°C. Also, azidodeoxy cellulose polymer decomposes exothermally at about 206°C in a single step. However, cellulose acetate nitrate decomposition occurs exothermally in a single step at about 208°C.

A tunable, near-infrared laser excites the target compound in the spectral region between 5800 to 6100 cm -1, and a microphone monitors the sound that they generate by non-radiative, collisional deexcitation processes. The photoacoustic signals result from first-overtone and combination absorptions of the energetic material's C-H vibrations, and the collisional processes enhance the signal at atmospheric pressure. The spectra reveal features that are unique to each measured material and these features can serve as a fingerprint for that material. We report the effects of laser energy and wavelength on signal intensity and estimate a detection limit for these compounds. © 2012 Society for Applied Spectroscopy.","2-s2.0-84865323252"

This has been driven primarily by increased incidents involving improvised explosive devices as well as their ease of assembly and leveraged disruption of transportation and commerce. With global expenditures for security-screening systems in the hundreds of billions of dollars, there is a pressing need to develop, apply, and harmonize standards for x-ray and gamma-ray screening systems used to detect explosives and other contraband. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been facilitating the development of standard measurement tools that can be used to gauge the technical performance (imaging quality) and radiation safety of systems used to screen luggage, persons, vehicles, cargo, and left-behind objects. After a review of this new suite of national standard test methods, test objects, and radiation-measurement protocols, we highlight some of the technical trends that are enhancing the revision of baseline standards.

The location of the buried conductive grid is determined by the time difference of reflected THz pulses between the front surface and the buried conductive grid. Since the wavelength of THz wave is usually larger than the roughness of unpolished optical surface and the period of conductive grid, the proposed method is insensitive to the surface condition. Furthermore, this is a non-contact and real-time measurement technique. The experimental result indicates that the accuracy of the measurement is at least on the order of 10 μm. Such kind of technique will be very helpful for enhancing the quality and reduce the cost of fabricating electro-optic windows with embedded conductive grids and/or wires. It can also be beneficial for some other applications. For example, since there are often embedded conductive wires in explosive devices, it can be used to detect the explosive devices because the proposed method can remotely determine the dimensions and locations of conductive wires embedded in dielectric enclosures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2-s2.0-84859062198"

Although many strategies have been successfully developed for the detection of TNT, it is not easy to differentiate the influence from TNP. Also, few methods were demonstrated for the selective detection of TNP. In this work, via a facile and versatile method, 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3)-based bluish green fluorescent composite nanospheres were successfully synthesized through self-assembly under vigorous stirring and ultrasonic treatment. These polymer-coated nanocomposites are not only water-stable but also highly luminescent. Based on the dramatic and selective fluorescence quenching of the nanocomposites via adding TNP into the aqueous solution, a sensitive and robust platform was developed for visual detection of TNP in the mixture of nitroaromatics including TNT, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and nitrobenzene (NB). Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the concentration of TNP in the range of 0.05-7.0 μg/mL with the 3σ limit of detection of 32.3 ng/mL. By handwriting or finger printing with TNP solution as ink on the filter paper soaked with the fluorescent nanocomposites, the bluish green fluorescence was instantly and dramatically quenched and the dark patterns were left on the paper.

Most techniques that offer eye-safe, long-range detection fail when unknown surfaces with no prior knowledge of the surface spectral properties are interrogated. Inhomogeneity in the surface concentration and optical absorption from background molecules can introduce significant reproducibility challenges for reliable detection when surface residue concentrations are below tens of micrograms per square centimeter. Here we present a coupled standoff technique that allows identification of explosive residues concentrations in the sub microgram per square centimeter range on real-world surfaces.

Organic explosives are difficult to analyze when present as residues on organic materials. Under these circumstances LIBS suffers from the limitations imposed by the limited spectroscopic information available for the analysis. Since ablation and subsequent plasma formation are sensitive to the beam focal conditions and the pulse energy deposited on the surface, the choice of an appropriate set of experimental conditions increases the surface sensitivity of the analysis and hence a selective inspection of the residue in the absence of spectral contribution from the organic support analyzed. 2-Mononitrotoluene (MNT), 2,6- dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) are used as model residues, whereas nylon and Teflon are used as illustrative surfaces of daily life objects. The results demonstrate that selective sampling is successfully achieved in all cases when the plasma formation threshold of the residues and the object is substantially different.

Rat olfactory epithelium was exposed to metal nanoparticles and odorant responses were quantified by EOG. Zinc nanoparticles added to explosive odorants strongly increased the odorant response in a dose-dependent manner.

Assuming smooth variations of the human body profile, objects' detection is performed by comparing the retrieved surface with a smoothed one.

Water soluble and surface unmodified GQDs, serving as a novel, effective and simple fluorescent sensing platform for ultrasensitive detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in solution by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching. The fluorescent GQDs can specifically bind TNT species by the π-π stacking interaction between GQDs and aromatic rings. The resultant TNT bound at the GQDs surface can strongly suppress the fluorescence emission by the FRET from GQDs donor to the irradiative TNT acceptor through intermolecular polar-polar interactions at spatial proximity. The unmodified GQDs can sensitively detect down to ∼0.495 ppm (2.2 μM) TNT with the use of only 1 mL of GQDs solution. The simple FRET-based GQDs reported here exhibit high and stable fluorescence. Eliminating further treatment or modification, this method simplifies and shortens the experimental process.

TPE-2PhOH nanoaggregates can be obtained from the nonsolvent-induced aggregation process. By alternately depositing 4,4′-biphenyldiazonium (BPD) salts and TPE-2PhOH nanoaggregates, layer-by-layer self-assembled films based on hydrogen-bonding interactions were successfully fabricated onto modified quartz slides. A more stable film was further prepared by subsequent decomposition of diazonium group (-N 2 +) under irradiation of UV light, which induces the conversation of the hydrogen-bond interaction between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of TPE-2PhOH nanoaggregates and diazonium groups into covalent bonds. The covalently linked self-assembled film exhibited highly fluorescence quenching sensitivity towards volatile of solid nitroanilines (2-nitroaniline (2-NA), 3-nitroaniline (3-NA) and 4-nitroaniline (4-NA)) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.

However, for most molecules of interest the double resonance is not realized with the excitation frequencies normally used in Raman. The latter may limit the practical applications of SERS for trace analysis. Here, we report that Raman-inactive trinitrotoluene (TNT) lights up the ultrahigh Raman scattering of off-resonated p-aminobenzenethiol (PABT) through the formation of charge-transfer TNT-PABT complex on the top-closed flexible silver nanotube array. Raman hot spots can spontaneously form in a reversible way by the self-approaching of flexible nanotubes driven through the capillary force of solvent evaporation. Meanwhile, the PABT-TNT-PABT bridges between self-approaching silver nanotubes possibly form by the specific complexing and zwitterion interactions, and the resultant chromophores can absorb the visible light that matches with the incident laser and the localized surface plasmon of a silver nanotube array. The multiple spectral resonances lead to the huge enhancement of Raman signals of PABT molecules due to the presence of ultratrace TNT. The enhancement effect is repeatedly renewable by the reconstruction of molecular bridges and can selectively detect TNT with a limit of 1.5 × 10-17 M.

In this work, the room-temperature and cryogenic terahertz spectra of two common improvised explosive oxidizers, namely, potassium nitrate (KN) and ammonium nitrate (AN), are presented, along with detailed solid-state density functional theory (DFT) analyses of the crystalline structures and spectral features. At both 294 and 78 K, KN exhibits two terahertz absorption features below 100 cm-1 that have been assigned through DFT simulations to arise from hindered nitrate rotations in the KN-II crystalline polymorph. The terahertz spectrum of AN exhibits a pronounced temperature dependence. The 294 K spectrum is free of any absorptions, whereas the 78 K spectrum consists of several narrow and intense peaks. The origin of this large difference is the polymorphic transition that occurs during cooling of AN, where room-temperature AN-IV is converted to AN-V at 255 K. The 78 K terahertz spectrum of AN is assigned here to various ion rotations and translations in the AN-V polymorph lattice. The analysis of the room-temperature AN-IV terahertz spectrum proved to be more complicated. The solid-state DFT simulations predicted that the room-temperature crystal structure of AN is not very well described using the standard Pmmn space-group symmetry as previously believed. The AN-IV polymorph actually belongs to the Pmn21 space group, and the perceived Pmmn symmetry results from vibrational averaging through nitrate rotations. This newly observed Pmn2 1 crystal symmetry for room-temperature AN is the reason for the absence of absorption features in the 294 K terahertz spectrum of AN and provides new insight into the polymorphic transitions of this ionic solid. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-80455168657"

The devices were produced via a combination of high precision micromilling and hot embossing. Mass transfer limitations were found in conventional microsystems and were minimized due to higher surface area to volume ratios that exceeded those possessed by conventional microdevices and capillaries.

These devices typically incorporate a polymer coating as an active layer that can bind the analytes of interest. Analyte adsorption causes a shift in the resonant frequency of the device proportional to the amount of adsorbedmaterial. Currently some of the polymer coatings used in these sensors utilize hydrogen bonding to adsorb analytes. Dipole-dipole type interactions can also be utilized to promote interaction of the analytes with the polymer coating. Polymer coating containing segments that have a permanent molecular dipole can interact with explosive taggants. In this study, novel polypropylene glycol based polymers that incorporate both hydrogen bonding moieties and segments having large permanent dipole moment (p-nitroazobenzene functional groups) were synthesized and tested. The precursor polymer was prepared by the polymerization of the diglycidyl ether end functionalized polypropylene glycol macromer and aniline. The precursor polymers were post functionalized by an azo-coupling reaction. The sensor response to saturated vapors of o-nitrotoluene, nitrobenzene and 2,4 dinitrotoluene (DNT) saturated vapors was evaluated. Incorporation of p-nitroazobenzene moieties in the polymer increased the sensitivity of detection of the analytes.

Despite the fact that both Raman spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) have shown their capability in standoff detection of explosives, such techniques are not exempt from certain limitations, in terms of sensitivity and selectivity, to carry out this purpose when they are used individually. For this reason, the idea for the fusion of data reported by these orthogonal techniques, Raman and LIBS, has been around for a while. The present manuscript proposes an approach for the combination of the spectral outputs of Raman and LIBS sensors (data fusion strategy) in order to obtain knowledge about the identity of compounds better than that achieved when each technique acts alone. After simple mathematical treatment, a new pattern of identification (two-dimensional, 2D, image) of several compounds (explosives, confusants, and supports) was generated from the assembly of their Raman and LIBS spectra. The efficiency of this strategy was evaluated by comparing the results obtained for differentiation between compounds using simple correlation coefficient values from the 2D images and those achieved using Raman and LIBS spectra separately. Additionally, the effect of two spectral pretreatments (autoscaling and normalization) on the generation of the 2D image was evaluated. The results derived from this study demonstrate that the 2D image improves the identification of compounds, mainly in those critical situations in which it is not easy to differentiate them when Raman spectroscopy or LIBS is used separately. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-80051758455"

Briefly, light (200-500 nm) is shone on a surface such as a piece of luggage at an airport or a parcel at a courier distribution center. Upon reflection, the light is collected with a spectrometer combined with a camera. A computer processes the data and produces in turn a differential reflection spectrum taken between two adjacent areas of the surface. This differential technique is highly sensitive and provides spectroscopic data of explosives. As an example, 2,4,6, trinitrotoluene (TNT) displays strong and distinct features in differential reflectograms near 420 nm. Similar, but distinctly different features are observed for other explosives such as RDX, PETN or ANFO.

NQR frequencies and relaxation times for the three ν+ and ν- lines of the ring 14N nuclei have been measured over the temperature range 230-330 K. The 1H NMR T1 dispersion has been measured for magnetic fields corresponding to the 1H NMR frequency range of 0-5.4 MHz. The results have been interpreted as due to hindered rotation of the NO2 group about the N-NO2 bond with an activation energy close to 92 kJ mol-1. Three dips in the 1H NMR dispersion near 120, 390 and 510 kHz are assigned to the ν0, ν- and ν+ transitions of the 14NO2 group. The temperature dependence of the inverse line-width parameters T2 of the three ν+ and ν- ring nitrogen transitions between 230 and 320 K can be explained by a distribution in the torsional oscillational amplitudes of the NO2 group about the N-NO2 bond at crystal defects whose values are consistent with the latter being mainly edge dislocations or impurities in the samples studied. Above 310 K, the 14N line widths are dominated by the rapid decrease in the spin-spin relaxation time T2 due to hindered rotation of the NO2 group. A consequence of this is that above this temperature, the 1H T1 values at the quadrupole dips are dominated by the spin mixing time between the 1H Zeeman levels and the combined 1H and 14N spin-spin levels. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A new optical detection system is proposed to address these issues by using the temporal and spectroscopic information generated by the surface plasmon coupling emission (SPCE) effect. Innovative SPCE optics have been designed using Zemax software to project the fluorescence signal into clear ""rainbow rings"" on a CCD with subnanometer wavelength resolution. The spectroscopic change of the fluorescence signal and the time history of such changes due to the presence of a certain explosive analyte are unique and can be used to identify explosives. Thanks to high optical efficiency, reporter depositions as small as 160-μm in diameter can generate a sufficient signal, allowing a dense array of different reporters to be interrogated with wavelength multiplexing and detect a wide range of explosives. We have demonstrated detection and classification of explosives, such as TNT, NT, NM, RDX, PETN, and AN, with two sensing materials in a prototype. © 2012 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84870207271"

Using the positive ion mode, molecular radical cations were easily generated for the detection of non-polar compounds (e.g., benzene, cyclohexane, etc.), while protonated molecular ions of polar compounds (e.g., acetonitrile, acetic ether) were readily produced for the detection. By dispensing the matrix in a relatively large space, this method tolerates highly complex matrices. For a given sample such as lily fragrances, more compounds were detected by the method established here than the EESI technique. An acceptable relative standard deviation (RSD 8.9%, n = 11) was obtained for the direct measurement of explosives (10 ppb) in waste water samples.

The aggregation of inter-dots induced by MHCs greatly influenced the light scattering property of the QDs in aqueous solution, and Rayleigh scattering (RS) enhancement at the defect-related emission wavelengths as well as its left side was observed with the excitation of CoD ZnS QDs by violet light. RS enhancement, combining with the quenching of the orange transition emission induced by TNT anions, resulted in a change in the ratiometric visualisation of the system being investigated.

This ratiometric probe can assay down to 25nM TNT in solution without interference from a matrix of real water sample and other nitroaromatic compounds.

Exposure to cyclic ketones results in a ratiometric fluorescence response. The thin films show orthogonal responses when exposed to cyclic ketones versus acyclic ketones.

RED incorporates compact IR quantum cascade lasers tuned to strong characteristic absorption bands and may be used to illuminate explosives present as particles on a surface. An IR focal plane array is used to image the surface and detect any small increase in the thermal emission upon laser illumination. We have previously demonstrated the technique at several meters to 10's of meters of stand-off distance indoors and in field tests [4,5], while operating the lasers below the eye-safe intensity limit (100 mWcm2) [6]. Sensitivity to traces of explosives as small as a nanogram has been demonstrated. By varying the incident wavelength slightly, we can readily show selectivity between individual explosives such as TNT and RDX. Using a sequence of lasers at different wavelengths, we increase both sensitivity and selectivity. A complete detection protocol can be performed in a sub-second time domain. More recently, RED has been used to emphasize measurements with cooled detectors in addition to examining the utility of filtering the collected thermal emission signal which is rich in analyte-specific spectroscopic information.

The utility of the COTS-ETD/API 2000 configuration for the characterization of the gas phase ion chemistry of COTS-ETD equipment was established by obtaining mass and tandem mass spectra in the continuous ion flow and selected mobility monitoring operating modes and by obtaining mass-selected ion mobility spectra for the explosive standard 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene (TNT).

The spectroscopic lidar setup allows for time resolved measurements with high temporal resolution. Raman spectra are observable, even in the presence of fluorescence. Experiments with low average laser power (tens of mWs) have shown the unambiguous capability to detect and identify explosives at distances ranging up to 20 m. Thanks to the combination of UV wavelength for higher Raman cross-sections and efficient gated detection the 355 nm prototype yielded the best compromise.

The first pulse is applied with frequency ν                             -                             , the second pulse with frequency ν                             0                             , and the third pulse with frequency ν                             -                             , but with a shifted phase. The NQR signal is detected at the frequency ν                             +                             . The maximal amplitude of the detected signal is obtained by tuning the pulse parameters at frequencies ν                             -                              and ν                             0                             .

First generation sensors, employing an isotopic source and NaI(Tl) gamma ray detectors, were deployed by Canadian Forces in 2002 as confirmation sensors on the ILDS teleoperated, vehicle-mounted, multi-sensor anti-tank landmine detection systems. The first generation TNA could detect anti-tank mines buried 10 cm or less in no more than a minute, but deeper mines and those significantly displaced horizontally required considerably longer times. Mines as deep as 30 cm could be detected with long counting times (1000 s). The second generation TNA detector is being developed with a number of improvements aimed at increasing sensitivity and facilitating ease of operation. Among these are an electronic neutron generator to increase sensitivity for deeper and horizontally displaced explosives; LaBr3(Ce) scintillators, to improve time response and energy resolution; improved thermal and electronic stability; improved sensor head geometry to minimize spatial response nonuniformity; and more robust data processing. This improved sensitivity can translate to either decreased counting times, decreased minimum detectable explosive quantities, increased maximum sensor-to-target displacement, or a trade off among all three. Experiments to characterize the performance of the latest generation TNA in detecting buried landmines and IEDs hidden in culverts were conducted during 2011. This paper describes the second generation system. The experimental setup and methodology are detailed and preliminary comparisons between the performance of first and second generation systems are presented. © 2012 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84875200874"

In particular, some opaque plastic containers and coloured glass bottles can be difficult to analyze using conventional backscatter Raman because the signal from the contents is often overwhelmed by the much stronger Raman signal and/or fluorescence originating from the container itself. SORS overcomes these difficulties and generates clean Raman spectra from both the container and the contents with no prior knowledge of either. This is achieved by making two, or more, Raman measurements at various offsets between the collection and illumination areas, each containing different proportions of the fingerprint signals from the container and content materials. Using scaled subtraction, or multivariate statistical methods, the two orthogonal signals can be separated numerically, thereby providing a clean Raman spectrum of the contents without contamination from the container. Consequently, SORS promises to significantly improve threat detection capability and decrease the false-alarm rate compared with conventional Raman spectroscopy making it considerably more suitable as an alarm resolution methodology (e.g. at airports). In this paper, the technique and method are described and a study of offset value optimization is described illustrating the difference between one and two fixed spatial offsets. It is concluded that two fixed offsets yield an improvement in the SORS measurement which will help maximize the threat detection capability. © 2011 SPIE.","2-s2.0-79960411381"

A sequence of images is recorded by the ICCD, where, for each recording, a different wavelength is selected by the tunable filter.

Among the range of different frequencies for electromagnetic excitation, the THz frequency range is of particular interest because of its nondestructive nature and ability to penetrate materials that are characteristic of clothing. Typically, the dielectric response properties for electromagnetic wave excitation at THz frequencies, as well as at other frequencies, are determined by means of experimental measurements. The present study, however, emphasizes that density functional theory (DFT), and associated software technology, is sufficiently mature for the determination of dielectric response functions, and actually provides complementary information to that obtained from experiment. In particular, these dielectric response functions provide quantitative initial estimates of spectral response features that can be adjusted with respect to additional information such as laboratory measurements and other types of theory-based calculations, as well as providing for the molecular level interpretation of response structure. This point is demonstrated in the present study by calculations of ground-state resonance structure associated with the high explosives RDX, TNT1, and TNT2 using DFT, which is for the construction of parameterized dielectric response functions for excitation by electromagnetic waves at frequencies within the THz range.

The method is based on electrochemical signals of an array of semiconductor gas sensors. In these sensor signals characteristic patterns of different substances are hidden. There are non-linear correlative relationships between the measured sensor signals and the chemical substances which are treated using two methods derived from statistical learning theory (Support Vector Machine - SVM, Maximum Likelihood Estimation - MLE) for the detection of the substance characteristics in the sensor signals. A key criterion for the presented pattern recognition is a newly developed type of features, which is specially adapted to the low frequency signals of semiconductor sensors. The presented features are based on the evaluation of the range of the transient response in the sensor signals in the frequency domain. To derive the new features, both real measurement data and synthetic generated signals were used. In the experiments the focus was set on the creation of reproducible sensor signals to get characteristic signal patterns. Synthetic signals were derived from a Gaussian Plume Model. With the new features, training data sets were calculated using the classification methods SVM and MLE. With these training data sets new sensor measurements may be assigned to the substances which are to be sought. The advantage of the presented method is that no feature reduction is needed and no loss of information occurs in the learning process. The classification results based on the new features have been compared with the classification based on a conventional method for feature extraction. It was proved that the recognition rate of the substances used with the new feature type is higher. The substance classification is primarily limited by the sensitivity of the semiconductor sensors, because sufficiently large sensor signals must have been provided to obtain appropriate substance patterns. At the present stage of development the method presented is suitable for the classification of substance groups, such as nitro aromatics or alcohols, but not for specific substances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The detected plasma was not stoichiometric and the line intensities, as well as their ratios, were changing even for an order of magnitude from one sampling point to another, particularly in the case of aromatic compounds. We explained some sources of such LIBS signal's behavior and this allowed us to establish a data processing procedure, which leads to a good linearization among the data sets.

The vaporized material is carried by air flows from the desorption unit to the inlet of the chemical analyzer, typically an ion mobility spectrometer. We have observed that the amount of explosives detected from a swipe varies with the physical location of explosives collected on the swipe. There are two issues that may contribute to this effect: inhomogeneous or insufficient heating of the swipe during desorption and low velocity air flows that inefficiently transport desorbed vapor during the instruments analysis time. To better characterize this effect, we have simulated the air movements within a generic desorption unit using commercially available computational fluid dynamics software. Simulations are three dimensional, symmetric and solved under steady, laminar flow conditions. The calculated velocity field correlates directly with experimental detector response to the high explosive RDX. Results suggest that the limiting factor in this model thermal desorption unit is the flow-field around the swipe and flow rate into the detector, rather than heat transfer to the swipe itself.

In addition, the neutron path length is obtained from a time-of-flight measurement, thus allowing the origin of the gamma rays inside the container to be determined. Information concerning the chemical composition of the target material is obtained from the analysis of the energy spectrum. The carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen relative count contributions must be converted to chemical proportions to distinguish illicit and benign organic materials. An extensive set of conversion factors based on Monte Carlo numerical simulations has been calculated, taking into account neutron slowing down and photon attenuation in the cargo materials. An experimental validation of the method is presented by comparing the measured chemical fractions of known materials, in the form of bare samples or hidden in a cargo container, to their real chemical composition.

It relies on the magnetic properties of some specific nuclei, such as nitrogen and chlorine, widely spread among explosives, narcotics or counterfeit medicines. In the basic NQR experiment, the signal (Free Induction Decay (FID)) is generated by a single radio frequency pulse. Because of its small amplitude, the signal is enhanced by averaging several measurements. However, the excitation cannot be repeated until the spin system relaxes back towards equilibrium and this recovery depends on the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1). This can be sorted out by using multi-pulse sequences. One type of multi-pulse sequence, Steady State Free Precession (SSFP), could be used when the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) of the compound is of the same order as T1.

The technology is further developed in order to enhance the sensitivity of the method and to be able to extend the field of applications. Raman scattering is a well-established technique able to detect substances down to single micrograms at standoff distances, however, one of the obstacles limiting the detection possibilities is interfering fluorescence, originating either from the substance itself or from the surrounding material. One main challenge for this technology is thus to either omit the excitation of the fluorescent process altogether or to be able to separate the two processes and only detect the Raman signal. Due to the difference in the temporal behavior of the two processes - Raman scattering occurs in the order of femtoseconds while fluorescence typically has a lifetime in the order of nanoseconds - one way to theoretically separate them is to limit the measurement to as short time as possible, cutting off most of the emitted fluorescence. The improvement depends on how much of the fluorescence can be omitted without decreasing the Raman signal. Experimentally, we have verified this improvement in signal to noise ratio when using a laser with picosecond pulses instead of nanosecond pulses, which has resulted in an improvement in SNR of up to 7 times for bulk ANFO.

In most practical situations, penetrating radiation is required, which restricts the problem to gamma rays and neutrons. The most successful reactions to date has been radiative thermal neutron capture (thermal neutron analysis) and prompt radiative emission following inelastic fast neutron scattering (fast neutron analysis). An alternative to these neutron-in, gamma ray-out reactions is photoneutron production. A gamma ray whose energy exceeds the threshold for neutron production in a particular atomic nucleus can cause a neutron to be emitted. For a given isotope and assuming monoenergetic photons, the emitted neutrons will have a spectrum consisting of one or more discrete energies. If the gamma ray source and neutron spectrometer are appropriately chosen, the neutron spectrum can be used as a fingerprint to identify the isotope. This photoneutron spectroscopy method has a number of potential advantages over thermal and fast neutron analysis, such as generally simpler spectra and low inherent natural neutron background. It also has drawbacks, such as possible induced neutron background and a present lack of suitable fieldable photon sources. This paper will describe the method and preliminary simulations and calculations to examine its feasibility.

Photothermal/photoacoustic interferometry (PTI), a variation of the aforementioned techniques, is a candidate for standoff detection as a result of its non-contact and non-destructive approach. In PTI, the transient PT/PA hydrodynamic response produced by impulsive infrared laser excitation(s) are detected by an overlapping focused probe laser beam. The return back-scattered/reflected probe laser beam is collected and coupled into a single-mode optical fiber. The PT/PA-induced perturbation on the return probe laser, in the form of phase or amplitude modulation or both, is extracted interferometrically. The resulting quadrature signals are digitized and processed to recover the minute PT/PA dynamics above background noise. Characteristic spectra for materials can be obtained by quantifying the PT response as a function of excitation(s) wavelength. The CW probe laser, operating in the 1550 nm range, and the constituents of the coherent detection system are commercial off-the-shelf components. A commercially available and continuously tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) with output pulse energies up to 50 nJ was employed to generate the PT/PA spectra in the 8.8-10.2 μm range. PTI detected absorption spectra were collected for HMX, RDX, and PETN, with the probe laser system positioned 5 meters away from the explosives targets.

In this paper we report a single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)-based chemiresistive immunosensor for label-free, rapid, sensitive and selective detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a small molecule. The newly developed immunosensor employed a displacement mode/format in which SWNTs network forming conduction channel of the sensor was first modified with trinitrophenyl (TNP), an analog of TNT, and then ligated with the anti-TNP single chain antibody. Upon exposure to TNT or its derivatives the bound antibodies were displaced producing a large change, several folds higher than the noise, in the resistance/conductance of SWNTs giving excellent limit of detection, sensitivity and selectivity.

In this approach, compact IR quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) tuned to strong absorption bands of trace explosives illuminate a surface of interest. An IR focal plane array is used to image the surface and detect any small increase in the thermal emission upon laser illumination. The technique has been previously demonstrated at several meters of stand-off distance indoors and in field tests with sensitivity to explosive traces as small as a single grain (∼1 ng), while operating the lasers below the eye-safe intensity limit (100 mW/cm2) at the tested wavelengths. By varying the incident wavelength slightly, selectivity between TNT and RDX has been achieved. A complete test and analysis can be performed in less than 1 second.

TNT sample volumes between 2 and 480 mL at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 ppb were passed through the DEB sorbents (imprinted or not imprinted for TNT) at pH 6 (sodium acetate) or at pH 7.4 (PBS). Release of target was accomplished using solvent mixtures of methanol/water with sodium acetate as electrolyte or acetonitrile/water with PBS components as electrolyte. Under these conditions, the TNT was released in <200 μL of the solvent mixture, and pre-concentration factors of >3000 can be achieved when using large volumes of trace TNT samples. When sample volumes of 2 mL were utilized, the sensing system gave a linear response between 20 and 500 ppb with an estimated limit of detection of 13 ppb. When pre-concentrating 480 mL of sample in either buffered solution or seawater, detection of 0.5 ppb TNT was achieved with a signal to noise ratio of 20.","2-s2.0-79957837953"

As coding additives (CAs), it is proposed to use aluminum alloy powders with dosed amounts of rare-earth coding elements (CEs). This choice is dictated by the fact that aluminum alloys are commonly used as efficient additives in explosive compositions, while rare-earth elements are used as additives in technological operations, but are absent in the composition of standard explosives. In this case, the key to information on a given explosive and its manufacturer is the ratio of CE concentrations determined when analyzing explosives, e.g., when investigating an act of terrorism.

In the first method, the threshold is set according to a general likelihood function corresponding to the energy channels of the spectrum. In this method, to improve the detection characteristics the number of counts in the channels must be multiplied by weighting factors. In the second method, the threshold is set according to the channel combinations. Here it is necessary to sort through the channel combinations. The calculations of the detection characteristics are performed for two setups: a neutron-activation channel is used in one and inelastic neutron scattering is used in the other.

In general, portable instruments are employed in close-contact applications like immovable artworks, contaminated soils and environmental diagnostic, while remote and stand-off instruments are normally used in analytical applications at distances where access to the sample is difficult or hazardous. Although remote and stand-off instruments are both used for chemical analysis at distances, the instrumental configurations are completely different.

Raman spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are two analytical techniques which share similar instrumentation and, at the same time, generate complementary data. These factors have been taken into account recently for the design of sensors used in the detection of explosives. Similarly, research on the proper integration of both techniques has been around for a while. A priori, the different operational conditions required by the two techniques oblige the acquisition of the response for each sensor through sequential analysis, previously necessary to define the proper hierarchy of actuation. However, such an approach does not guarantee that Raman and LIBS responses obtained may relate to each other. Nonetheless, the possible advantages arising from the integration of the molecular and elemental spectroscopic information come with an obvious underlying requirement, simultaneous data acquisition.

Recorded emissions demonstrate that it is possible to inject arbitrary signals into a radio's unintended emissions using a relatively weak stimulation signal.

Most showed remarkable sensitivity in the negative-ion mode, yielding limits of detection in the low picogram range, particularly when analyzed from a glass substrate heated to 120 °C. Ions typically formed from these molecules (M) by LTP include [M + NO2]-, [M]-, and [M - NO 2]-. The LTP-mass spectrometry methodology displayed a linear signal response over three orders of magnitude of analyte amount for the studied explosives. In addition, the effects of synthetic matrices and different types of surfaces were evaluated. The data obtained demonstrate that LTP-MS allows detection of ultratrace amounts of explosives and confirmation of their identity. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to confirm the presence of selected explosives at low levels; for example, TNT was confirmed at absolute levels as low as 0.6 pg. Linearity and intraand interday precision were also evaluated, yielding results that demonstrate the potential usefulness and ruggedness of LTP-MS for the detection of explosives of different classes. The use of ion/molecule reactions to form adducts with particular explosives such as RDX and HMX was shown to enhance the selectivity and specificity.

Although the resultant MHCs may quench the fluorescence at 430 nm, interdots aggregation can greatly influence the light scattering property of the aqueous QDs system, and therefore, dominant RS enhancement at defect-related emission wavelength was observed under the excitation of violet light of Mn-doped ZnS QDs, which was applied in chemodosimetry to image TNT in water. Meanwhile, Mn-doped ZnS QDs also exhibited a highly selective response to the quenching of the 4T1-6A1 transition emission (RTP) and showed a very good linearity in the range of 0.0025-0.45 μM TNT with detection limit down to 0.8 nM and RSD of 2.3% (n = 5).

In this study a non-imaging polarized THz passive system for detecting and identifying concealed explosives overcoming the forgoing shortcomings is developed. The system employs a polarized passive THz sensor in acquiring emitted data from a scene that may have concealed explosives.

A key challenge for stand-off sensors is to distinguish explosives, with high confidence, from a myriad of unknown background materials that may have interfering spectral peaks. To address this, we have investigated a new technique that simultaneously detects Raman spectra from multiple DUV excitation wavelengths. Due to complex interplay of resonant enhancement, self-absorption and laser penetration depth, significant intensity variation is observed between corresponding Raman bands with different excitation wavelengths. These variations with excitation wavelength provide a unique signature that complements the traditional Raman signature to improve specificity relative to single-excitation-wavelength techniques. We have measured these signatures for a wide range of explosives using amplitude-calibrated Raman spectra, obtained sequentially by tuning a frequency-doubled Argon laser to 229, 238, 244 and 248 nm. For nearly all explosives, these signatures are found to be highly specific. An algorithm is developed to quantify the specificity of this technique.

The telescope was coupled via a fibre optic bundle to an Acton standard series SP-2750 spectrograph with a PI-MAX 1024RB intensified CCD camera equipped with a 500-ps gating option for detection. Gating proved to be essential for achieving high signal-to-noise ratios in the recorded stand-off Raman spectra. In some cases, gating also allowed suppression of disturbing fluorescence signals. For the first time, quantitative analysis of stand-off Raman spectra was performed using both univariate and multivariate methods of data analysis.

For the univariate method, stand-off Raman spectra obtained at a distance of 9 m on sodium chloride pellets containing varying amounts of ammonium nitrate (0-100%) were used. For the multivariate quantification of ternary xylene mixtures (0-100%), stand-off spectra at a distance of 5 m were used.

To be effective over a wide range of cargo materials, in particular for hydrogenous cargo such as food, and to offer practical inspection times, the neutron source must be very strong, typically >1010 neutrons per second. Unfortunately there are currently no reasonably compact and economical neutron generators with the required intensities. The insufficiency and inadequacy of intense neutron sources are especially conspicuous in the ≤2.5 MeV range (low voltage (d,D) generator). This energy range is needed if the strong signature of prompt fission neutrons (≈3 per fission) is to be detected and discerned from the numerous source neutrons. The photonuclear reactions of x-rays from commercial linacs in appropriate converters can provide ample intensities of neutrons. These converters have a very low (γ,n) energy threshold: 1.67 MeV for beryllium and 2.23 MeV for deuterium. The intense x-ray beams provided by commercial x-ray systems, more than compensate for the relatively low (γ,n) cross-sections which are in the milli-barn range. The choice of converter material, the geometrical shape, dimensions and location relative to the x-ray source, determine the efficiency of the neutron conversion. For electron accelerators with less than 10 MeV, the preferred converters, Be and D2O, are also very good neutron moderators. Thus, while increasing the converters' thickness leads to an increase in the overall neutron yield, this causes the softening of the neutron spectrum, which reduces the neutron penetration especially in hydrogenous cargos. Photoneutron sources can be optimized to meet specific needs such as maximum fission signals in various cargo materials of interest. Efficient photoneutron sources with different energy spectra were investigated. Conversion efficiency of more than 10-4 neutron per 9 MeV electron yielding neutron intensities of more than 1011 n/s for commercial 100 μAmp electron accelerators has been modeled and designed.

The ability of two first-generation dendrimers comprised of bifluorene-containing chromophores to sense explosive analytes was compared with the chemically related polymer poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluoren-2,7- diyl). One dendrimer was planar with a single chromophore with the second having four chromophores tetrahedrally arranged around an adamantyl center. All the materials had high photoluminescence quantum yields of around 90% and were able to sense explosive analytes via quenching of their fluorescence. The three-dimensional dendrimer based upon the adamantyl core was found to have the highest Stern-Volmer constants for all the analytes tested with the planar dendrimer also proving to be on average superior to the polymer. The TRPL measurements showed that sensing occurred by a combination of collisional and static quenching with the proportion of collisional quenching being based on the number of aromatic units in the analyte. Steady-state fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements of the three materials revealed that for the three-dimensional dendrimer an exciton can migrate between all of the chromophores, meaning that an exciton formed on one chromophore of the dendrimer can be quenched by an analyte interacting with a second chromophore.

Our THz system, a time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) system, is based on a femtosecond laser whose radiation is converted into THz radiation by a low-temperature grown GaAs photoconductive switch. A similar switch detects the reflected signal. The advantage of using a TDS system is that pulses reflected from the barrier and the actual explosive, arrive at different instances at the detector. This simplifies the separation of the barrier signature from the explosive signature, compared to a frequency domain system. However, partial temporal overlap between the two pulses makes it challenging to completely separate the spectral characteristics of the explosive from the characteristics of the barrier. Also, in addition to attenuating the THz-pulses, transmission through barrier materials may add spectral features to the reflected signal, hampering recognition of the explosive.

It is noteworthy that an ethylhexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide bilayer surrounding each individual nanoparticle not only is responsible for these periodic gap structures, but also tends to promote the adsorption of TNT on the composite NPs, thus resulting in a considerable increase of Raman signal.

The idea is based on the close similarities in the chemical structures of the widespread explosives and herbicides, with the latter known to inhibit functioning of the PS II by attaching to the binding site of the QB mobile plastoquinone electron acceptor. The gold screen-printed electrodes (Au-SPE) functionalized with PS II-enriched particles were used for the detection of explosives in a droplet biosensor configuration. A crude preparation of PS II produced from spinach leaves, known as BBY particles, was employed to modify the Au-SPE working electrode employing BSA-glutaraldehyde-based immobilization procedure. Inhibition of the PS II functioning was detected by photo-electrochemical measurements in the presence of a mediator (either non-native quinone or ferricyanide). The biosensor was highly responsive to herbicides (as expected) as well as to picric acid, with limits of detection in the nanomolar range, but trace detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) was not effective. The detection limit for picric acid was 25 nM as compared to ∼400 nM for TNT with duroquinone mediator.

Signals of both the B-CARS and spontaneous Raman scattering under similar conditions were monitored to compare their sensitivities. In addition, the dependence of the B-CARS signal on the distance was measured at short ranges and the standoff detection capabilities of the method at long distances estimated. The measurements imply that B-CARS allows favorable detection as compared to Raman. However, an inherent drawback of the developed narrowband B-CARS method is the need to scan the Stokes beam frequency to monitor the different vibrational levels of the detected species.

By imaging the surface using multispectral imaging Raman technique the explosive particles can be identified and displayed using color-coding. The technique has been demonstrated by detecting fingerprints containing significant amounts of 2,4-dinitrotoulene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoulene (TNT) and ammonium nitrate at a distance of 12 m in less than 90 seconds (22 images × 4 seconds)1.

Therefore, LIBS is a viable technology for the detection of substances of interest in near real-time fielded remote sensing scenarios. Of particular interest to military and security operations is the detection of explosive residues on various surfaces. It has been demonstrated that LIBS is capable of detecting such residues, however, the surface or substrate on which the residue is present can alter the observed spectra. Standard chemometric techniques such as principal components analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis have previously been applied to explosive residue detection, however, the classification techniques developed on such data perform best against residue/substrate pairs that were included in model training but do not perform well when the residue/substrate pairs are not in the training set. Specifically residues in the training set may not be correctly detected if they are presented on a previously unseen substrate. In this work, we explicitly model LIBS spectra resulting from the residue and substrate to attempt to separate the response from each of the two components. This separation process is performed jointly with classifier design to ensure that the classifier that is developed is able to detect residues of interest without being confused by variations in the substrates.

In this paper, we consider the scattering of α particle in the D-T reaction chamber wall is the main reason to the resolution of time spectrum. A measured device of time spectra based on associated α particle technique was built. A cone-shaped α particle collimator was designed to restrain the gamma induced by the neutron which is correlated to the scattering α particle. Thus, the resolution of the time spectrum was improved. Measurements show that with and without the collimator, the resolutions of the time spectrum are 1.8 ns and 6.4 ns, respectively.","2-s2.0-77958505918"

For the first time, a method of directly modifying a siloxane sensing bilayer on an SiO2 surface is proposed to replace the conventional self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols on Au to avoid the trouble from long-term unstable Au-S bonds. For modifying the long-term reliable sensing bilayer on the piezoresistor-integrated micro-cantilevers, a siloxane-head bottom layer is self-assembled directly on the SiO2 cantilever surface, which is followed by grafting another explosive-sensing-group functionalized molecule layer on top of the siloxane layer. The siloxane-modified sensor has experimentally exhibited a highly resoluble response to 0.1ppb TNT vapor. More importantly, the repeated detection results after 140days show no obvious attenuation in sensing signal. Also observed experimentally, the specific adsorption of the siloxane sensing bilayer to TNT molecules causes a tensile surface stress on the cantilever. Herein the measured tensile surface stress is in contrast to the compressive surface stress normally measured from conventional cantilever sensors where the sensitive thiol-SAMs are modified on an Au surface. The reason for this newly observed phenomenon is discussed and preliminarily analyzed. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-77953482532"

The traditional view of ""trace"" level residue may lie within the detection limit capabilities of bench-top instrumentation. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry, often the main stay of many trace evidence analysis laboratories can readily deliver nanogram and now potentially upper picogram detection limits. Today, emerging technologies continue to push the limits of detection, and sub-nanogram restrictions give way to picogram and femtogram opportunities. As instrument technologies become more sensitive, the need to work at continually lower detection levels is expressed. Generation of reliable, reproducible ultra-trace samples for the testing, analysis and evaluation of those technologies is challenged by the chemical properties of the very samples under investigation. Unlike testing against bulk quantities of explosives, at the picogram level unforeseen sublimation and sorption phenomena may potentially disrupt an otherwise well-planned test. While it may be valid to assume that the properties of bulk samples of most explosives are relatively constant with respect to time, it may not be safe to assume the same is true of ultra-trace level deposits of explosive residue. The vapor pressures of many common military explosives are low, but they are not zero. This fact cannot be ignored when working with trace levels of explosive residue. Failure of an inexperienced technician to consider these factors when conducting an evaluation may unnecessarily introduce bias into the data, and may result in the misrepresentation of a sensor's capabilities. The analyst is now faced with the complication of working with amounts of explosive so potentially low, that loss of a few picograms of material due to evaporation, air currents, poor laboratory technique or some other diluting factor represents a significant percentage of the total sample mass. Added to the complication are sample and substrate matrix, carry-over, and potential cross contamination effects that may now pose a significant effect rather than a slight background nuisance. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","2-s2.0-77955856971"

They were chosen because intensive characterization of the materials already existed including shock sensitivity and cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) impurity levels.

The organic composite used was a combination of P3HT (poly 3-hexylthiophene), CuTPP (CuII tetraphenylporphyrin) and ADB (copolymer of diethynyl-pentiptycene and dibenzyl-ProDOT). The incorporation of ADB into P3HT/CuTPP composite makes the film porous and thereby increases the sensitivity of the sensors by increasing the permeability of the analyte into the sensing polymeric matrix. Secondly, it increases the surface roughness which eventually increases the surface area resulting in an increased sensitivity. Along with an improved sensitivity (enhances the response by around 30% to nitro based explosive compounds), the sensors exhibit an excellent selectivity for nitro based explosive analytes like TNT, RDX, DNB as compared to the vapors of non-explosive oxidizing agents such as nitrobenzene (NB), benzoquinone (BQ) and benzophenone (BP).

We have investigated the suitability of Drosophila receptors as detectors for volatiles with applications in law enforcement, emergency response, and security. We first characterized responses of the majority of olfactory neuron types to a set of diagnostic odorants. Being thus able to correctly identify neurons, we then screened for responses from 38 different types of neurons to 35 agents. We identified 13 neuron types with responses to 13 agents. As individual Drosophila receptor genes have been mapped to neuron types, we can infer which genes confer responsiveness to the neurons. The responses were confirmed for one receptor by expressing it in a nonresponsive neuron. The fly olfactory system is mainly adapted to detect volatiles from fermenting fruits.

The elemental density ratios (C/O, N/O, H/N, etc.) of explosives are different from the other substances. The explosives are characterized by low H and C concentration and high N and O concentration. The elemental composition of explosive materials can be found by measuring the γ-rays produced due to the activation of explosive material by 14MeV neutrons. A pulsed fast neutron system is used for the identification of H, N and O. Ammonium nitrate sample has been irradiated by pulsed 14MeV neutrons of 108 neutrons/pulse and the pulse width less than a microsecond. The material has been irradiated with 5-7 neutron pulse in order to increase the γ-ray count. The resulting γ-ray spectrum due to the activation of ammonium nitrate is recorded and presented in this work. The γ-ray spectrum has been recorded using 3"" × 3"" Bismuth Germanium Orthosilicate (BGO) and fast digitizer with sampling rate of 2 GS/s.

The result is a change of propellants' physical, chemical, thermal, ballistic and mechanical properties. The final consequence is reduction of performances and decrease of safe service lifetime of propellants. Reduction of mechanical properties of a propellant grain during ageing can be the factor that limits rockets safe service time. On the other hand, the change in amount of nitroglycerin significantly affects mechanical properties. This is the reason why the evaporation of nitroglycerin from double base propellants is a subject of great importance. In this work we have studied a very early stage of evaporation of nitroglycerin from a double base rocket propellant applying isothermal thermogravimetry experiments. The experiments were done with a propellant containing 27% nitroglycerin, using thin plate samples having a thickness of 0.2-0.4 mm and weighing ∼4 mg. It was found that at a very early stage the evaporation can be described by the zero-order reaction model, while the entire process is characterized by power law decrees of the evaporation rate with time. The Langmuir vaporization equation, and equations proposed by Pieterse and Focke, and by Beverley et al. are used to relate nitroglycerin mass loss data and the vapor pressure.

Biologically derived odorant receptors have potential as the explosive recognition element in novel biosensors. Caenorhabditis elegans' genome contains over 1,000 uncharacterised candidate chemosensory receptors. It was not known whether any of these respond to volatile chemicals derived from or associated with explosives. Methodology/Principal Findings: We assayed C. elegans for chemotactic responses to chemical vapours of explosives and compounds associated with explosives. C. elegans failed to respond to many of the explosive materials themselves but showed strong chemotaxis with a number of compounds associated with commercial or homemade explosives. Genetic mutant strains were used to identify the likely neuronal location of a putative receptor responding to cyclohexanone, which is a contaminant of some compounded explosives, and to identify the specific transduction pathway involved. Upper limits on the sensitivity of the nematode were calculated. A sensory adaptation protocol was used to estimate the receptive range of the receptor.

Today, the standard sampling procedure involves physical removal of particulate matter from surfaces of interest. A variety of collection methods have been used including air-jetting or swabbing surfaces of interest. The sampled particles are typically heated to generate vapor for analysis in hand held, bench top, or portal detection systems. These sampling methods are time-consuming (and hence costly), require a skilled technician for optimal performance, and are inherently non-selective, allowing non-explosives particles to be co-sampled and analyzed. This can adversely affect the sensitivity and selectivity of detectors, especially those with a limited dynamic range. We present a new approach to sampling solid particles on a solid surface that is targeted, non-contact, and which selectively enhances trace explosive signatures thus improving the selectivity and sensitivity of existing detectors. Our method involves the illumination of a surface of interest with infrared laser light with a wavelength that matches a distinctive vibrational mode of an explosive. The resonant coupling of laser energy results in rapid heating of explosive particles and rapid release of a vapor plume. Neighboring particles unrelated to explosives are generally not directly heated as their vibrational modes are not resonant with the laser. As a result, the generated vapor plume includes a higher concentration of explosives than if the particles were heated with a non-selective light source (e.g. heat lamp). We present results with both benchtop infrared lasers as well as miniature quantum cascade lasers. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","2-s2.0-77955884953"

The effects of the growth conditions such as concentrations of the reagents and applied potentials on the morphology and structure of as-prepared tree-like nanostructures have also been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the silver nanodendrites (AgNDs), the diameter of the trunk is around 100-200 nm with length up to 10-40 μm, and the length of its branches can reach 10 μm. In addition, the electrocatalytic behavior of this modified electrode was exploited as a sensitive detection system for the reduction of RDX high explosive, hydrogen peroxide and hexacyanoferrate (HCF) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Also, the obtained results were compared to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and bulk silver electrodes.

In the one-laser technique, a laser tuned to 226 nm excites the energetic material and both generates the characteristic NO photofragments and facilitates their detection by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) using their A-X (0,0) transitions near 226 nm. In contrast, in the two-laser technique, a 454 nm laser generates the analyte molecule in the gas phase by matrix-assisted desorption, and a second laser tuned to 226 nm both photofragments it and ionizes the resulting NO. We report the effects of laser energy, analyte concentration, and matrix concentration on the ion signal and determine the rotational temperatures of the NO photofragments from Boltzmann, rotational distribution analysis of the REMPI spectra.
