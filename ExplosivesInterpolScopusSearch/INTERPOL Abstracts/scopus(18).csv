The experiments are conducted in a direct impact configuration, where a polycarbonate projectile is directly shot onto polymer bonded sugar samples at different impact velocities. During the deformation process, the images are captured at five million frames/second using an ultrahigh speed camera. For the macro scale experiment, the images are captured at a resolution of 75 μm/pixel and for the mesoscale experiments, the magnification factor is 10 μm/pixel. The deformation field is obtained using digital image correlation technique. From the macroscale displacement field, the spatial stress distribution is calculated using a nonparametric method. The meso-scale experiments are used to explain the deformation mechanisms observed at the macroscale. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2019.","2-s2.0-85061261873"

The research was carried out to determine the pressure and macroscopic temperature variation occurring in the specimen by using a pressure sensor and a thermocouple. High-speed photography was used to reveal the macroscopic ignition phenomena. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the material composition of raw and recovered specimens. The results of the experiments described here clearly show that specimens underwent crush, melt and ignition from impact to reaction. At the same time, the relative content of aluminium decreased. Compared to the direct impact results from split Hopkinson compression-shear bar tests, the drop-weight loading pulse is longer, so PBX specimens ignite more easily. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Hotspots occur due to several dissipation mechanisms, including viscoplasticity, viscoelasticity, and internal friction along crack surfaces. To analyze the contributions of these mechanisms, we quantify the ignition probability, energy dissipation, damage evolution, and hotspot characteristics of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) with various levels of constituent plasticity of the energetic phase and internal crack face friction. Using PBX9501 consisting of HMX (Octahydro-1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,2,3,5-Tetrazocine) and Estane as a reference material, we analyze variants of this material with several values of the yield stress of the energetic phase and coefficients of internal crack face friction, while other parameters are kept unchanged. The impact loading involves piston velocities between 200 and 1200 m/s. The analysis uses a Lagrangian cohesive finite element framework that explicitly accounts for finite-strain elastic-viscoplastic deformation of the grains, viscoelastic deformation of the binder, arbitrary crack initiation and propagation in the grains and the binder, debonding between the grains and the binder, contact between internal surfaces, friction and frictional heating along internal surfaces, heat generation resulting from inelastic bulk deformation, and heat conduction. To determine the ignition status of the material or “go” or “no-go” state, we use a criterion based on a criticality threshold obtained from chemical kinetics calculations. For PBX with various levels of HMX plasticity and friction, the probability of ignition, the evolution of dissipation caused by plasticity and friction, the density of cracks, and the locations of cracks are quantified. Results show that samples with higher levels of constituent plasticity (lower yield strengths) or lower levels of internal friction are less likely to ignite. The relative importance of plasticity and friction depends on load intensity, with frictional heating decreasing as load intensity increases. Although the overall viscoplastic heating outweighs the overall frictional heating, friction plays a very important role in hotspot development at all load intensities analyzed, owing to the fact that frictional heating is more localized than viscoplastic heating. The predicted thresholds and ignition probabilities are expressed in a load intensity-load duration relation for PBX with different constituent properties. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85058169273"

The results indicated that, the thermal conductivity of PBX was only slightly improved with very low GNP loading (0.05 wt% and 0.15 wt%). However, a remarkable enhanced effect was observed at a relatively high GNP loading (0.5 wt% and 1 wt%). The thermal conductivity of PBX had a nonlinear dependence on the GNPs loading. The nonlinear dependence of the thermal conductivity on GNPs content was fitted by an analytical model which incorporated all the effects. And the thermal conduction mechanism of GNPs based composite could change from series thermal structure to parallel thermal structure with the GNP loading increasing. Additionally, the calculated thermal shock resistance and thermal stress distribution of PBX was both enhanced with the GNP loading. Finally, the sensitivity of sensitive hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) based PBX composition could be improved by GNPs due to enhanced thermal conductivity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84971300780"

A sluggish structural transformation is identified, which started at ∼2.4 GPa and completed at ∼10.6 GPa. The crystal structure of high pressure (phase II) is refined to possess a symmetry of P2. The structural transformation is indicated by the obvious changes in XRD patterns, Raman spectra, and discontinuities of peak positions. Variations in lattice constants and volume of unit cell of the ambient structure (phase I) up to ∼10.0 GPa are also presented. The compressibility of phase I is anisotropic. The compression ratio of b axis is larger than that of a and c axes. The bulk modulus of phase I is B0 = 24.5(4) GPa, and its first pressure derivative is B0′ = 4.5(2). The phase transition is reversible, as the XRD pattern transformed to the initial profile upon release of pressure. On the basis of the Raman and XRD analysis, the high-pressure-induced phase transition of ammonium perchlorate is proposed to be associated with rearrangement of hydrogen-bonded networks. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85049353508"

A new method for the synthesis of HMX from 3,7-dipropionyl-1,3,5,7-tetraazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (DPPT) was investigated. Two important intermediates, 1,5-dipropionyl-3-nitroso-7-nitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (DPNNO) and 1,5-dipropionyl-3,7-dinitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (DPDN), were isolated from the reaction mixture. The reaction mechanism, involving a nitrolysis-nitrosolysis-nitrolysis-nitrolysis process, was proposed and verified by the 1H-NMR tracking. Based on the reaction mechanism, a stepwise method to prepare HMX from DPPT was developed. DPPT could be efficiently and smoothly converted to DPNNO in red fuming nitric acid with excellent yield up to 94.2 %. The influence factors on the yields of HMX such as reaction temperature, loading amounts of N2O5 were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, HMX was obtained with a satisfactory yield of 85.0 %. The overall yield of the stepwise procedure was as high as 80.0 %. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Structure, sensitivity, thermal and hygroscopicity performances of the UF-AP based composites were systematically studied by scanning electron microscopy, sensitivity tests, thermal experiments, contact angle, and hygroscopicity analysis. The results showed that both the impact and friction sensitivity of UF-AP can be remarkably reduced, respectively, with only a small amount of 2 % (in mass) desensitization agents. Meanwhile, improved thermal decomposition was gained, and the hygroscopicity can also be reduced to a large extent. Propellants containing 10 % coated UF-AP in mass were processed and tested, the burning rate reached 45.7 mm s−1, 50 % higher compared with that of normal AP, with remarkably reduced impact sensitivity from 11.5 J to 29.6 J and friction sensitivity from 76 % to 28 %. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The principle of NACs detection is simple since any explosive emits a rather small, but detectable number of molecules. Thus, numerous detection techniques have been developed throughout the years, but their common limitations are rather large sizes and weights, high power consumption, unreliable detection with false alarms, insufficient sensitivity and/or chemical selectivity, and hyper-sensitivity to mechanical influences associated with very high price. Thus, there is a strong need of cheap, rapid, sensitive, and simple analytical methods for the detection and monitoring of these explosives in air. Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOs) allow the preparation of gas sensors able to partially or totally overcome these drawbacks, and this paper aims to shortly review the most recent SMOs nanocomposites able to sense explosives. © 2018 by the authors.

Modified double base (MDB) propellant based on stoichiometric binary mixture of oxidizer-metal fuel (Ammonium perchlorate/Aluminum), and energetic nitramines (HMX) offered enhanced thrust as well as combustion characteristics. This study is devoted to evaluate the impact of such energetic additives on thermal behavior, chemical stability, and shelf life. Extruded MDB formulations were manufactured by extrusion process. Artificial aging at 80 °C for 28 days was conducted. Shelf life assessment was performed using Van't Hoff's equation. Quantification of evolved NOx gases with aging time was performed using quantitative stability tests. MDB formulation based on HMX demonstrated extended service life of 16 years compared with (AP/Al)-MDB which demonstrated 9 years. This finding was ascribed to the reactivity of AP with nitroglycerin with the formation of perchloric acid. Thermal behavior of aged MDB, exhibited an increase in heat released with time; this was ascribed to the auto-catalytic thermal degradation during artificial aging. The increase in released heat by 31% was found to be equivalent to evolved NOx gases of 6.2 cm3/5 g and 2.5 cm3/1 g for Bergmann-Junk test, and Vacuum stability test respectively. This manuscript shaded the light on a novel approach to quantify evolved NOx gases to heat released with aging time.

So far only limited attempts have been made to scale up the production to tens or maximally a few hunderds of grams. This paper provides a review of these small scale production methods as well as characterization techniques for nanometric explosives and oxidizers. As a result of the limited scale-up, the application of energetic nanomaterials in typical propellant and explosive formulations is currently very limited. This might be caused by the fact that a clear and commonly shared view on which energetic nanomaterials and production processes it would be economically beneficial and feasible to invest in is lacking at the moment. Furthermore, a considerable number of technical challenges can be expected regarding the processing of energetic nanomaterials on a composition level. To manage these challenges, this review proposes several technical solutions which may contribute to a better understanding of the benefits, risks and costs involved in the use and scale-up of energetic nanomaterials and, if considered economically feasible, a more widespread application of these nanomaterials in the defense and space domains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85048729581"

We have observed dramatically increased handling sensitivity of ETN in the molten state, using temperature controlled drop-weight impact sensitivity measurements. Impact testing was performed using ERL Type 12 drop hammer equipment using a 2.5 kg weight, a 0.8 kg striker, an anvil and sound detection equipment. Most experiments were performed in the absence of standard grit paper, due to the elevated temperature measurements with a liquid. At room temperature, ETN exhibited an impact sensitivity of 14.7 ± 3.4 cm, which changed to 1.0 ± 0.6 cm in the liquid state at 65 °C. The change in sensitivity in the liquid state was found to be reversible upon solidification, and did not appear to correlate with temperature. Control experiments were performed in the same setup using standard explosives pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP). This is the most sensitive material that we have been able to measure using our instrumentation, and indicates that ETN be handled with extreme caution during the melt-casting process. © 2019 The Authors","2-s2.0-85059819983"

Due to these complex competing chemical and physical elements, a unifying relationship between molecular framework, crystal structure, and sensitivity has yet to be developed. In order to move towards this goal, ideally experimental studies should be performed on systems with small, systematic structural modifications, with modeling utilized to interpret experimental results. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a common nitrate ester explosive that has been widely studied due to its use in military and commercial explosives.

We relate the handling sensitivity properties of each PETN derivative to its structural properties, and discuss the potential roles of thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity and heat of formation, thermal stability, crystal structure, compressibility, and inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding on impact sensitivity.

This article studied the thermal properties transformed from thermal decomposition to thermal explosion for a less violent nitrocellulose sample (nitrogen content: 10.92%). Four experiments were implemented: XPS analysis and SEM analysis, DSC-TG analysis, and small-scale thermal explosion experiment. From XPS analysis and SEM analysis, high temperatures led to the decrease of N1s and O1s (O-NO2 bond) and the break or even “melt” of the nitrocellulose fibers. The results demonstrated that nitrocellulose would become more unstable if it was exposed to high temperature. From the DSC-TG analysis and small-scale thermal explosion experiment, the upper critical ambient temperatures (UCATs) of the nitrocellulose were calculated. The UCATs of the nitrocellulose sample would decrease from 132.5ºC to 96.4ºC with the dimensions increased from 0.1 m to 1.6 m.

However, at the time of the airbag inflation, the gas generators release toxic combustion gases such as CO, NH3, and NOx. In this study, we investigated the combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of GN/BCN mixture, focusing primarily on their exhaust gas composition. As a result, when the exhaust gas of the combustion under constant pressure in an inert gas stream was analyzed using a detection tube, the amount of NOx (mainly NO) yielded greater decrease with increasing atmospheric pressure as compared to the amounts of CO and NH3. Thus, provided GN/BCN is ignited in a closed container, a large amount of NOx is presumed to have been released during the initial stage of combustion, which yielded comparatively low pressure. Results of the thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG/DSC/FTIR) indicated that the GN/BCN mixture caused endothermic decomposition at 170 °C and exothermic decomposition at 208 °C, which was accompanied by 66% mass loss.

Trends from pulse-chromatographic iGC-investigations are mostly followed in breakthrough and thermal desorption experiments using a 1000 ppm nitromethane source. In these experiments, HKUST-1 proves the peak substance, with enrichment factors being 109-fold higher than for Tenax, followed by MIL-53. In case of HKUST-1, this factor is successfully reproduced for a 1 ppm concentration scenario. This shows that archetype MOFs can be suitable or even superior candidates for a sensitive sensing of nitroalkane explosives from the gas phase by a concept of preconcentration. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The evolution of shock into the detonation of TATB requires academic attention and research. A multi-points laser interferometer termed a photon Doppler velocimeter and a rotating mirror streak camera were used to study the shock initiation of detonation in a pressed solid explosive formulation, JBO-9021, which contained 85 wt.% TATB, 10 wt.% HMX and 5 wt.% Kel-F binder. In conventional experiments, the test explosive was assembled by using several columniform explosives with different external diameters. A new device was designed to solve complex problems. This device comprised a wedge-shaped explosive sample and a transparent window, and by using this device, the particle-velocity histories of eight shock positions and the shockwave velocity could be obtained. A series of shock-initiation experiments on high explosive JBO-9021 was performed, and the explosive samples were initiated at different intensity input shocks by an explosive-driven attenuator. The photon Doppler velocimeter was used to detail the growth from an input shock to detonation, and the increase in particle velocity in unreacted JBO-9021 was also obtained in low-intensity shock-initiation experiments. The shock velocity was measured with a rotating mirror streak camera in one experiment. Hugoniot data for JBO-9021 in the form of a shock velocity versus a particle velocity and the initial shock pressure versus a distance-to-detonation relationship (Pop-plot) were obtained. Based on the experimental results, the shock-sensitivity characteristic of JBO-9021 was described. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim","2-s2.0-85057590385"

It showed that the mixed explosives are more sensitive than pure powdery explosives. Hard salt particles could greatly enhance the burning probability of powdery explosives because frictional heat between salt particles and target explosive powders, stress concentration, and new generated fragments of large granule jointly contribute to heat accumulation at the junction of dissimilar materials.

Such sensitivities could be controlled by adjusting the surface area or (in)organic additives; however, increased stability leads to a decrease in the explosives' performance. Here, high-energy-density molecules hosted in inverse opal-like porous carbon (IOC) nanocomposites demonstrate the mechanical stabilization and desensitization of RDX and HMX inside the carbon nanostructure using host-guest chemistry techniques. For this strategy, the uniform, vacant voids of the IOC were used to provide internal crystallization for the impact/frictional stabilization of explosives, and also to enhance the thermal reactivity by the high heat conductivity of IOC initiating detonation by thermally induced hotspot. The weight percentage of high explosives hosted by recrystallization at high temperatures and in vacuum reached ∼70%. After high explosives were embedded inside the IOC, the impact, friction and electrostatic stability was greatly increased (2-2.15-fold, 1.86-1.92-fold, and 1.25-2-fold, respectively) compared with free RDX and HMX.

To expand the forensic strategy, elemental analysis of the plastic caps which are present in these items was performed. Both x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis was performed to explore the possibilities for differentiation. The inherent inhomogeneity of the plastics resulted in high variations, especially for LA-ICP-MS trace analysis. In addition, due to the lack of suitable reference materials the LA-ICP-MS results can only be used for qualitative comparisons. Although XRF is less sensitive it allows for semi-quantitative analysis and the effect of inhomogeneity is significantly reduced due to the larger sample areas. Therefore, XRF is the method of choice for elemental analysis of intact plastic caps. In this scenario initial differentiation based on visual examination is combined with elemental analysis to obtain the highest degree of discrimination. In post-explosive scenarios, using XRF is not as straightforward due the irregular shapes of the burned plastic cap residues and contamination by explosive residues. For the analysis of these post-explosive caps, LA-ICP-MS proved to be useful for characterization and differentiation. Overall, it was found that blue caps contain a considerable higher amount of elements than the white caps, mainly due to additives related to the coloring process. This limits differentiation for the flash bangers containing white caps. Therefore, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis was performed to increase the differentiation potential. Based on carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios additional sets could be distinguished, both for flash bangers containing white and blue caps, that otherwise have similar visual and elemental characteristics. With the elemental and isotopic analysis of the plastic caps, an analysis strategy has been introduced that is not based on the pyrotechnic charge and therefore provides a unique opportunity to perform characterization and differentiation of flash bangers in pre- and post-explosive casework. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85050120435"

While each of these application categories is very distinct in terms of the analytical challenges posed, there are a number of common themes than can be identified from an examination of the relevant literature appearing over the review period. The traditional atomic spectrometry techniques (e.g. AAS, OES, XRF, ICP-MS) are relatively mature, but reports continue to appear that seek to address perceived limitations in sensitivity in certain applications, but increasingly more frequently in relation to sample handling and preparation/extraction methodologies, validation and creation of SRMs and methods. However, it is equally clear that because of that very maturity such techniques are more often cited as analytical reference methods to support the development of other approaches (e.g. GD-OES, GD-MS, PIXE, PIGE, RBS, SEM-EDS, SIMS, TXRF, micro- and macro-XRF, XAS, XPS) that provide either direct sampling or depth and lateral elemental profiling capabilities. Consequently, a variety of techniques may now be routinely applied within an individual study to characterise samples to the extent it is hard to comment critically on the particular analytical novelty that lies at the heart of the work. It is fair to say that in some cases, the significance of the research now involves revealing the features of the sample (including examining surface modifications, coatings, thin films and multilayers, or even the characteristics of a device, functional component, or object, or complex mixture) rather than in the development of the analytical approach itself. That said, certain trends in technique development still expand the range of applications that can be addressed. For example, interest in LIBS continues to command attention and is heavily cited in most application sections of this review. The technique offers certain unique advantage for elemental analysis in rapid direct sampling, portability and operating in remote and harsh environments (including industrial production) where low level detection is not essential. Clearly sensitivity remains the Achilles' heel for LIBS but developments in measurement technique such as pulse delay are resulting in better optimised procedures. The development in laser solid sampling technology is providing benefits applicable to other techniques such as ICP-MS and newer variants such as laser ionisation MS. Indeed, lasers, flames, plasmas and other electrical discharges have been used regularly in the fabrication of samples. The atomic spectrometry techniques with which they have been associated are now employed to study such production processes in situ. The development of nanomaterials has given rise to new approaches to particle size distribution and single particle characterisation where the atomic spectrometric determination produces a size rather than a concentration. There is evidence too in the review of research work going on to understand the environmental consequences of the widespread use of new technologies using data analysis approaches to examine source, provenance or impact. Consequently, while the fundamental analytical questions: ""What?"" and ""How much?"" continue to be relevant to researchers increasingly these must now be qualified in many situations by providing answers to enquiries such as ""Where?"" and ""How big (or small)?"". © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.","2-s2.0-84993969583"

However, they suffer from sintering and incomplete combustion, leading to poor reactivity and low energy utilization efficiency. In order to enhance the energy output and combustion performance of nanothermites, ammonium perchlorate (AP) was introduced into the Al/CuO nanothermites. The nanothermites with varied content of AP were prepared by electrospray. The morphological characterization of the nanothermites confirms that the nanoparticles are homogeneously mixed without agglomeration. Heat release, specific impulse, and peak pressure of gaseous products exhibit remarkable enhancement with increasing AP content. Specifically, the nanothermites with 7.5 wt % AP produce specific impulse and heat energy of ∼2.7 and ∼1.4 times higher than those of Al/CuO-based nanothermites without AP. In addition, the ignition delay time of the nanothermites containing AP is not greatly increased, enabling fast response during practical applications. Thermal analysis implies that the thermite reaction between Al and CuO can be divided into two steps in the presence of AP: solid-solid phase and liquid-solid phase diffusion reaction. These results provide facile strategy to enhance the output performance of nanothermites, which may facilitate the practical propulsion and combustion applications of nanothermites. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85046467208"

Overpressure sensors, an infrared thermal imager, and a high-velocity photography system were used to compare the explosive fireball temperature, scattering movement, and post-combustion characteristics of composite charges with different non-detonative materials. The fireball temperature distributions of the active non-detonative materials (rubber containing various proportions of aluminum powder) were not uniform, and the heat radiation power, heat flux, and overpressure were relatively high and first decreased and then increased with increasing aluminum powder content. The active non-detonative materials had two high-temperature regions in the lateral direction. Oxygen-free explosions, anaerobic combustion, and post-combustion processes occurred during the energy-release reaction of the composite charges. The temporal evolution of the throwing radius of the explosion products of the composite charges was investigated, and the rate of scattering of the non-detonative materials was analyzed. The rate of scattering was higher than that of an inert non-detonative material (polyurethane) and first increased and then decreased with increasing aluminum powder content.

Design/methodology/approach: Following a short introduction, this first considers remote gas detection using the DIAL technique. Remote gas cloud imaging is then discussed, and this is followed by a review of chemical warfare agent detection technologies. A selection of research activities and product developments aimed at remotely detecting explosives are considered and, finally, brief concluding comments are drawn. Findings: Remote gas sensing is now a practical reality, and products are available which can remotely detect, identify, quantify and in some cases visualise a wide range of toxic and environmentally threatening gases. These satisfy numerous industrial, environmental and military applications. Remotely detecting explosives poses a significant technological challenge, and despite some commercialisation, it remains the topic of an extensive research effort, much involving LIBS and Raman techniques. Importantly, much of this work also has potential in non-military applications, with several developments being shown to detect various industrially important compounds.

Fillers of these PBXs are nitramines 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and β-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5-tetrazocane (β-HMX), cis-1,3,4,6-tetranitro-octahydroimidazo-[4,5-d]imidazole (bicyclo-HMX, BCHMX) and ε-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (ε-HNIW, CL-20) which are bonded by polyfluoro-elastomers, polydimethyl-siloxane, poly-glycidyl azide, polyisobutylene, polystyrene-butadiene, poly-acrylonitrile-butadiene and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene in addition to a melt cast compositions based on 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. For thirty two of these PBXs the relationships are specified and analyzed between heats of their combustion and relative explosive strengths; by means of these relationships it might be possible to estimate, which groupings in the macromolecule of binder could be liable to their primary fission in the PBXs initiation. Similarly, for forty two of these explosives, the relationships are described and analyzed between their enthalpies of formation and impact sensitivities; here is especially attention paid to PBXs filled by BCHMX. Specific rate constants from Vacuum Stability Test (VST) of four nitramines and twenty PBXs are introduced into relationships with their enthalpies of formation. Regarding to all the mentioned cases, increasing of energy content of the studied explosives leads to increase of the relative explosive strength or initiation reactivity, respectively. Exception with the opposite trend, the outputs of VST are for BCHMX, where in PBXs are matrices with the esteric plasticizers or the energetic poly-glycidyl azide. Admixture of RDX or HMX, respectively, into the BCHX PBXs gives ternary PBXs whose thermal stability, in the sense of applied VST, is higher comparing to the original binary explosives. © 2018 The Authors","2-s2.0-85059354510"

Much research has been carried out to aid in the vapor detection of traditional explosives, such as the nitro-based explosives like trinitrotoluene (TNT) and black and smokeless powders. Many of these explosives have extremely low vapor pressures, thus related vaporous components of the vapor signature are used for detection by proxy. As most of these explosives are extremely stable, their vapor signatures do not change significantly with time or environment. In contrast, comparatively little research has been done on the vapor detection of homemade explosives (HMEs), whose unique chemistries make vapor signature analysis a more complex problem.

It was shown that the burning rate of the DB propellants can be significantly enhanced by both the nanocomposite catalysts, with reduced pressure exponent. In particular, the Cu2O−PbO/GO induced a burn rate enhancement for DB propellant in pressure range of 2–14 MPa, with the maximum catalytic efficiency of 3.87 at 2 MPa. More interestingly, it resulted in “mesa” burning of DB propellant in the pressure range of 12–20 MPa (n=-0.05). The CuO−Bi2O3/GO have the same effect with a burning rate increasing from 2.15 to 8.57 mm s−1 at 2 MPa. Similarly, for the RDX-CMDB propellant, the GO-based composites of Cu2O−PbO/GO and CuO−Bi2O3/GO showed evident catalytic activities. Plateau combustion was achieved in their presence, which is of great importance for practical applications.

Forensic chemists have been spearheaded to develop information-rich confirmatory technologies and techniques and apply them to a broad array of forensic challenges. The purpose of these confirmatory techniques is to provide alternatives to presumptive techniques that rely on data such as color changes, pattern matching, or retention time alone, which are prone to more false positives. To this end, the application of separation techniques in conjunction with mass spectrometry has played an important role in the analysis of forensic evidence. Moreover, in the past few years the role of liquid separation techniques, such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry, has gained significant tractions and have been applied to a wide range of chemicals, from small molecules such as drugs and explosives, to large molecules such as proteins. For example, proteomics and peptidomics have been used for identification of humans, organs, and bodily fluids. A wide range of HPLC techniques including reversed phase, hydrophilic interaction, mixed-mode, supercritical fluid, multidimensional chromatography, and nanoLC, as well as several modes of capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry, including capillary zone electrophoresis, partial filling, full filling, and micellar electrokenetic chromatography have been applied to the analysis drugs, explosives, and questioned documents.

By use of ultrasound to induce intense, localized frictional heating at the surface of crystals embedded in a flexible polymer, we have created a new method for the initiation of microexplosions under conditions where temporal and spatially resolved observations can be made. Specifically, we report the use of ultrasound to flash-heat polymer-embedded <500 μm RDX (CH2NNO2)3 and HMX (CH2NNO2)4 crystals at rates >10000 K/s. By using this extremely rapid heating on small samples, we were able to confine the explosion to narrow regions in time and space. The explosion was measured using dual thermal imagers providing temporal and spatial resolutions of 1 μs and 15 μm. Surprisingly, the explosions always occurred in two stages, an initial 0.1 ms stage and a subsequent 100 ms stage. The first stage of RDX explosion (2500 K lasting 140 μs) was less violent than that for HMX (4400 K lasting 70 μs), which is consistent with the general observation that HMX is regarded as a higher-performance explosive. The origin of the two-stage explosion originates from how the explosive chemistry is modulated by the mechanical behavior of the flexible polymer at the interface with the explosive crystal.

The thermal PA spectra of samples were recorded using fourth harmonic wavelength i.e. 266 nm of pulse duration 7 ns and repetition rate 10 Hz obtained from Q-switched Nd: YAG laser system. Under the influence of UV radiation, the explosive molecules in vapor phase follow the photodissociation process and converted into their byproducts such as NO, NO2 and N2O etc. due to π* ← n transitions, which are responsible for the generation resultant PA signal at 266 nm wavelength. The results obtained from PA spectra as a function of temperature are cross verified with Thermo gravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) to ascertain the thermal stability of these samples. The comparative PA spectra of samples were analyzed and shown the behavior of acoustic modes with respect to incident laser energy, and data acquisition time.

The damage mechanisms and the corresponding fracture modes of PBX under different impact loadings were analyzed.

The changes in the structure and reactivity of AP as a result of mechanical processing were studied by methods of synchronous thermal analysis with registration of mass spectra, x-ray diffraction, microscopy and elemental analysis. Mechanical treatment reduces the particle size from 1000 μm to a fraction of μm and leads to formation of agglomerates of submicron particles with sizes of 5–10 μm. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the absence of the formation of new phases and a substantial broadening of the diffraction lines. As a result of mechanical activation, the temperature of AP thermal decomposition decreases by more than 100 °C, accompanied by the rapid release of oxygen at temperatures of 250–260 °C, immediately after the phase transformation in AP.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to predict the stability, sensitivity, energetic performance and mechanical properties of cocrystal models. The binding energy, trigger bond length distribution, interaction energy of trigger bond, cohesive energy density, detonation parameters and mechanical properties were calculated and compared. The influences of adulteration crystal defect on comprehensive properties of CL-20/TNT cocrystal explosive were explored and estimated. The results show that compared with primitive model, binding energies of defective models are decreased by 0.91–14.67%, i.e., the intermolecular interaction energy is decreased and stability is weakened. The maximum trigger bond length is increased by 0.33–4.36%, while the interaction energy of trigger bond is decreased by 1.33–12.27% and cohesive energy density is decreased by 0.45–11.24%, indicating that sensitivity is increased and safety is decreased. The density, detonation velocity and detonation pressure of defective models are decreased by 0.11–7.75%, 0.13–6.47%, 0.32–16.41%, respectively, illustrating that the power and energy density are decreased.

DAAF has safety characteristics (impact, friction) similar to triaminotrinitrobenzene and shock sensitivity similar to HMX. The present article describes the thermal analysis and sensitivity study of DAAF with RDX and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). DAAF has been evaluated as a possible replacement for RDX in TNT-based, aluminized as well as nonaluminized melt cast formulation. DAAF-based melt cast formulations were characterized for their sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, bomb calorimetric analysis, and thermal decomposition behavior. The thermal analysis reveals the compatibility of DAAF with benchmark explosives like RDX and TNT in explosive formulations. The composition DT (DAAF + TNT) and DTA (DAAF + TNT+ Al) is more friction and impact insensitive as compared to RT (RDX + TNT) and RTA (RDX + TNT+ Al) compositions. The bomb calorimetric values of DT composition as well as DTA composition are higher than RT and RTA compositions.

Based on the proposed method, the dynamic response of concrete and energy output of RDX/Al/wax with four different aluminum reaction rates were calculated. The results indicate a positive correlation between the crushed region radius and the aluminum reaction rate, and that the cracked region radius is inversely proportional to the aluminum reaction rate. For the energy output of RDX/Al/wax, the shock wave energy grows with increasing aluminum reaction rate, while the detonation products expansion energy increases and then drops with rising aluminum reaction rate, peaking at 2.37 MJ/kg when the Al reaction rate constant M=0.02.

We used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of the parameters to determine the sensitivity of the model to variation in the parameters. We also successfully validated the model using one-dimensional time-to-explosion (ODTX and P-ODTX) data from a different laboratory. Our SITI test matrix included 1) different densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.63 g/cm3, 2) free gas volumes ranging from 1.2 to 38 cm3, and 3) boundary temperatures ranging from 170 to 190 °C. We measured internal temperatures using embedded thermocouples at various radial locations as well as pressure using tubing that was connected from the free gas volume (ullage) to a pressure gauge. We also measured gas flow from our vented experiments. A borescope was included to obtain in situ video during some SITI experiments. We observed significant changes in the explosive volume prior to ignition. Our model, in conjunction with data observations, imply that internal accumulation of decomposition gases in high density PBX 9407 (90% of the theoretical maximum density) can contribute to significant strain whether or not the experiment is vented or sealed. © 2018","2-s2.0-85054434943"

Detonation failure, here defined as a weakly supported shock wave traveling with a decaying velocity, of aluminized ammonium nitrate (AN/Al) was considered to investigate the relationship between the detonation failure process and shock sensitivity. Previous work has shown that the Al additive particle size alters the failure diameter, a measure of shock sensitivity, of AN/Al. Microwave interferometry was used to measure the transient shock wave velocity in the explosive system, which was lightly confined at a diameter below its critical diameter, in response to an overdriven shock insult in a small-scale experiment. An array of mixture ratios and particle size distributions of the explosive system was used to vary the sensitivity of the explosive and to facilitate exploration of the relationship between the shock velocity decay rate, initiation mechanisms, and large-scale shock sensitivity. Resulting shock velocity profiles in AN/Al indicate that micron-sized and larger Al particles can contribute to the detonation process. It is concluded that the rate at which the transient shock velocity approaches that of a compressive wave with no supporting reaction corresponds to the relative shock sensitivity of the system; it is therefore proposed that the measured shock velocity decay rate of an overdriven sub-critical diameter charge of AN/Al reveals quantifiable information about the relative shock sensitivity of a large-scale charge. © 2018 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85047365878"

This chapter provides an overview of the main developments of the three types of nanoexplosives (nano-individual explosives, nanocomposites, and nano-cocrystals) from preparation and characterization of properties, using a comparison of different approaches for preparing nanoexplosives. Attention is also paid to the relationships between particle size at the nanoscale and performance. Finally, research challenges and future trends are also discussed.

CAN is also frequently used to make homemade explosives. The potential of using elemental profiling and chemometrics to match both pristine and reprocessed CAN fertilizers to their factories of origin for use in future forensic investigations was examined. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentrations of 64 elements in 125 samples from 11 CAN stocks from 6 different CAN factories. Using Fisher ratio and degree-of-class-separation, the elements Na, V, Mn, Cu, Ga, Sr, Ba and U were selected for classification of the CAN samples into 5 factory groups; one group was two factories from the same fertilizer company. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was used to develop a classification model which was tested on a separate set of samples. The test set included samples that were analyzed at a different time period and samples from factory stocks that were not part of the training set. For pristine CAN samples, i.e., unadulterated prills, 73% of the test samples were matched to their correct factory group with the remaining 27% undetermined using strict classification. The same PLSDA model was used to correctly match all CAN samples that were reprocessed by mixing with powdered sugar. For CAN samples that were reprocessed by mixing with aluminum or by extraction of AN with tap or bottled water, correct classification was observed for one factory group, but source matching was confounded with adulterant interference for two other factories. The elemental signatures of the water-insoluble (calcium carbonate) portions of CAN provided a greater degree of discrimination between factories than the water-soluble portions of CAN. In summary, this work illustrates the strong potential for matching unadulterated CAN fertilizer samples to their manufacturing facility using elemental profiling and chemometrics. The effectiveness of this method for source determination of reprocessed CAN is dependent on how much an adulterant alters the recovered elemental profile of CAN. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85020039731"

The main goal of this article is to present a comprehensive Life-Cycle Assessment of civil explosive production and assess the environmental impacts of five alternative explosive compositions in order to identify the compositions with lower impacts and opportunities for improvement. A detailed inventory was implemented, based on data collected from a specific European company. Three complementary Life-Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods were used to assess primary energy, six environmental impacts (CML method) and three toxicity impacts (USEtox method). The results obtained with the CML and USEtox were compared with a recent LCIA method (ReCiPe), aiming at improving the robustness of our conclusions and understanding the differences between LCIA methods. The results showed that the main contributor for the ten impact categories is the emulsion explosive composition, mainly due to ammonium nitrate production. The comparison of five alternative emulsion explosive compositions showed that the inclusion of sodium nitrate leads to a reduction in impacts. A contribution analysis carried out with ReCiPe provided similar conclusions with those calculated with CML; however ReCiPe and USEtox calculated different toxicology impacts, due to different substances coverage and characterization factors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

On this basis, much has been said about the possible benefits resulting from the use of molecular and atomic information for the detection of explosives. The orthogonal nature of the spectral and compositional information provided by Raman spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) makes them suitable candidates for an optimal combination of their data, thus achieving inferences that are not feasible using a single sensor. The present manuscript evaluates several architectures for the combination of spectral outputs from these two sensors in order to compare the benefits and drawbacks of data fusion for improving the overall identification performance. From the simple assembling (concatenation or addition) of Raman and LIBS spectra to signals' processing on the basis of linear algebra (either the outer product or the outer sum), different identification patterns of several compounds (explosives, potential confusants and supports) have been built. The efficiency on target differentiation by using each of the architectures has been evaluated by comparing the identification yield obtained for all the inspected targets from correlation and similarity measurements. Additionally, a specific code integrated by several of these patterns to identify each compound has also been evaluated. This approach permits to obtain a better knowledge about the identity of an interrogated target, mainly in those decisive cases in which LIBS or Raman cannot be effective separately to reach a decision. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Under optimised conditions maximum degradations of 70% and 54% for TATP and HMTD, respectively were achieved at 162 μL min-1, and 9% degradation for MEKP at 180 μL min-1. Flow rates were precisely controlled in this single source pneumatic pressure driven multi-channel FIA system by model experiments on mixing of easily detectable component solutions. The linear range for detection of TATP, HMTD and H2O2 was 1-200 μM (r2=0.98-0.99) at both flow rates, while that for MEKP was 20-200 μM (r2=0.97) at 180 μL min-1.

In this endeavour, carbon and silver nanoparticle impregnated graft polymers of poly(vinylalcohol) and polythiophene are synthesized via a single step free radical polymerization reaction for sensing nitroaromatic compounds via fluorescence measurements. The key role of the conducting nanoparticles is to enhance the π-electron density of the luminescent polymer. These electron rich nanocomposites are successfully utilized for highly selective and ultrasensitive detection of electron deficient nitroaromatic explosives based on a fluorescence quenching method. Quenching efficiencies of the carbon and silver nanocomposites for highly electron deficient picric acid (PA) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) are found to be 99% and 95% respectively. Mechanistic studies have been further explored in detail and it is observed that in most of the analytes including picric acid, a combination of excited state Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) leads to quenching of fluorescence. On the other hand, in analytes such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 1,4-dinitrobenzene and nitrobenzene excited state PET is the only reason behind fluorescence quenching.

A quantitative evaluation of explosives in the treated soil, compared with untreated soil, was applied to assess explosive removal. The immobilization of HMs was assessed by toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tests, and by investigating the migration of HMs fractions.

Here we examine the cycling and fate of TNT in the coastal marine systems by spiking a marine mesocosm containing seawater, sediments, and macrobiota with isotopically labeled TNT (15N-[TNT]), simultaneously monitoring removal, transformation, mineralization, sorption, and biological uptake over a period of 16 days. TNT degradation was rapid, and we observed accumulation of reduced transformation products dissolved in the water column and in pore waters, sorbed to sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM), and in the tissues of macrobiota. Bulk δ15N analysis of sediments, SPM, and tissues revealed large quantities of 15N beyond that accounted for in identifiable derivatives. TNT-derived N was also found in the dissolved inorganic N (DIN) pool.

These include magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and strontium (Sr). Samples with a similar elemental profile may be differentiated based on their isotopic composition.

We conducted a series of kinetic and equilibrium batch experiments to characterize the fate of NTO in soils and the effect of soil geochemical properties on NTO-soil interactions. A set of experiments was also conducted using sterilized soils to evaluate the contribution of biodegradation to NTO attenuation. Measured pH values for NTO solutions decreased from 5.98 ± 0.13 to 3.50 ± 0.06 with increase in NTO concentration from 0.78 to 100 mg L-1. Conversely, the pH of soil suspensions was not significantly affected by NTO in this concentration range.

Freestanding silicon QDs may represent a benign alternative with a high degree of chemical and physical versatility. Here, we investigate dodecyl and amine-terminated Si-QD luminescence response to the presence of nitrobenzene and dinitrotoluene (DNT) in various solid, solution, and vapor forms. For dinitrotoluene vapor the 3σ detection limit was 6 ppb for monomer-terminated QDs.

A key limitation of all currently utilized field techniques is that they require close proximity or physical interaction with the object being analyzed.

A piezoelectric inkjet printhead located atop a drying tube produces precise droplets containing defined quantities of analyte. Droplets solidify into microparticles with known composition and size as they traverse down the drying tube. Because this is a drop-on-demand printing process, a known number of droplets are produced providing quantitative particle delivery to a variety of substrates. Particular emphasis is placed on the development and characterization of the drying tube in this work. The drying tube was modeled using computational fluid dynamics and experimentally evaluated using laser-based flow visualization techniques. A notable design feature of the drying tube is the ability to push heated air through the tube rather than the need to pull air from the exit. This provides the ability to place a known number of well-defined particles onto almost any substrate of interest, rather than having to collect particles onto a filter first and then transfer them to another surface. Several types of particles have been produced by this system, examples of which are pure particles of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine ranging from 10 μm to 30 μm in diameter, and ammonium nitrate particles of 40 μm diameter.

However, up to now, the effects of substrate (such as morphology, size, material composition) on the performance of electrochemical sensors have been mainly focused on metal platform, while the investigation about metal oxide substrate has not been reported in detail. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a technologically important semiconducting material with large band gap energy between 3.2 and 3.4 eV at room temperature which has attracted widespread attentions. In previous reports, the nanostructured ZnO was randomly formed on graphene layers. The control of morphology or size of nanostructures is a prerequisite for the nanostructure for fabricating various types of nanocomposites. Here, we used graphene oxide (GNO) as the supporting material for constructing a series of synchronously electrochemically reduced graphene oxide and zinc oxide composites (rGNO-ZnO) with different morphologies for comparing their morphology-dependent electrochemical sensing behaviors. The experimental parameters, such as the electrodeposition potential, time, and concentration of electrolyte, would influence the composite morphology and further bring different electrochemical sensing ability. Among them, rGNO-ZnO with nanowalls morphology (noted GZNWs), obtained from the conditions of 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 electrolyte, -1.0 V electrodeposition potential and 30 min electrodeposition time, presented an optimal ability for DNA detection and 2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) electrocatalysis. The fine nanowall structure may be able to provide more accessible sites, and the synergistic effect between rGNO and ZnO may enlarge the electrochemical activity. The electrochemical DNA sensor based on GZNWs exhibited the steepest slope with the detection range, as well as the highest sensitivity when compared with other electrodeposition potentials. In order to further explore the other electrochemical performances (for instance the electrocatalysis), the GZNWs was used to detect the nitroaromatic compound (such as 2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene, TNT).

While a number of classifiers exhibiting high discriminatory power have been reported, efforts in establishing the subset of relevant spectral features that enable a fundamental interpretation of the segmentation capability and avoid the 'curse of dimensionality' have been lacking. Using LIBS data acquired from a set of secondary explosives, we investigate judicious feature selection approaches and architect two different chemometrics classifiers -based on feature selection through prerequisite knowledge of the sample composition and genetic algorithm, respectively. While the full spectral input results in classification rate of ca.92%, selection of only carbon to hydrogen spectral window results in near identical performance. Importantly, the genetic algorithm-derived classifier shows a statistically significant improvement to ca. 94% accuracy for prospective classification, even though the number of features used is an order of magnitude smaller.

Loss of munitions constituents from the sorbent phase after uptake was observed for the ""pesticide"" POCIS configuration but not for the ""pharmaceutical"" configuration.

Under constant exposure conditions, TNT, ADNTs, DANT, RDX, and atrazine (a common environmental contaminant) accumulated at a linear rate for at least 14d, with sampling rates between 34mL/d and 215mL/d. When POCIS were exposed to fluctuating concentrations, analyte accumulation values were similar to values found during constant exposure, indicating that the sampler was indeed integrative. In contrast, caffeine (a common polar contaminant) and TNX did not accumulate at a linear rate and had a reduction in accumulation of greater than 50% on the POCIS during fluctuating exposures, demonstrating that POCIS did not sample those chemicals in an integrative manner. Moreover, in a flow-through microcosm containing the explosive formulation Composition B, TNT and RDX were readily measured using POCIS, despite relatively high turnover rates and thus reduced water concentrations.

A queuing network was applied for theoretical modeling of the SSCP performance, and a DES model using Arena Version 12 was used for an empirical approach. Data were collected from both literature and by manual collection during the peak operating time of the airport that was modeled. The simulation model was verified and validated qualitatively and quantitatively by statistical testing before experimentation. After validation, a sensitivity analysis was performed on baggage volume of passengers (PAX) and the alarm rate of baggage screening devices, where SSCP throughput and PAX cycle time, were the dependent measures. The theoretical queuing network proved an accurate method of predicting cycle time for the system while in steady state but was subject to various assumptions. The empirical model and sensitivity analysis showed that SSCP throughput and cycle time are both highly sensitive to alarm rate. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis showed that SSCP throughput was completely resilient to baggage volume, while cycle time was moderately sensitive to baggage volume.

Initial materials-based coarse segmentations, generated using the Dual-Energy Index (DEI), are refined by partitioning at automatically detected regions. Partitioning is guided by a novel random forest based quality metric, trained to recognise high-quality, single-object segments. A second novel segmentation quality measure is presented for quantifying the quality of full segmentations based on the random forest metric of the constituent parts and the error in the number of objects segmented. In a comparative evaluation between the proposed approach and three state-of-the-art volumetric segmentation techniques designed for single-energy CT data (two region-growing [1,2] and one graph-based [3]) our method is shown to outperform both region-growing methods in terms of segmentation quality and speed. Although the graph-based approach generates more accurate partitions, it is characterised by high processing times and is significantly outperformed by the proposed method in this regard. The observations made in this study indicate that the proposed segmentation technique is well-suited to the baggage security-screening domain, where the demand for computational efficiency is paramount to maximise throughput. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The present work reports the enhancement of lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) by employing copper chromium as a catalyst. The LiClO4 decomposition rate depends on the catalyst characteristics, such as chemical composition, specific surface, and crystalline structure. Scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction analyses were used to characterize CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts. The samples are prepared using the sol-gel method with different mole ratios. Furthermore, the samples are tested to evaluate their effect on the LiClO4 decomposition at various temperatures. The blank tests comparison shows that the CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts strongly enhance the LiClO4 decomposition. Moreover, CuCr2O4 is formed in the CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts. The Cr-Cu binary composite catalysts show smaller crystallites, larger surface area, and better catalytic performance than the pure CuO samples because of the interaction of Cr and Cu ions.

However, most of the previous chemiresistor sensors for explosive detection are suffering from limited responses and long response time. Here, a transition-metal-doping method is presented to remarkably promote the quantity of the surface defect states and to significantly reduce the charge transfer distance by creating a local charge reservoir layer. Thus, the sensor response is greatly enhanced and the response time is remarkably shortened. The resulting sensory array can not only detect military explosives, such as, TNT, DNT, PNT, PA, and RDX with high response, but also can fully distinguish some of the improvised explosive vapors, such as AN and urea, due to the huge response reaching to 100%. Furthermore, this sensory array can discriminate ppb-level TNT and ppt-level RDX from structurally similar and high-concentration interfering aromatic gases in less than 12 s.

Recently, ultrasonic excitation has been shown to generate heat within plastic-bonded energetic materials. To investigate the impact of crystal morphology on this heating, samples of elastic binder are implanted with single ammonium perchlorate crystals of two distinct shape groups. Contact piezoelectric transducers are then used to excite the samples at ultrasonic frequencies. The thermal responses of the crystals are recorded using infrared thermography, and the rate of heating is estimated. Surface temperature increases up to 15 °C are found to arise after 2 s of excitation, with much higher heating levels expected near the inclusions themselves as demonstrated by the chemical decomposition of some crystals under favorable excitation conditions. The rates of heat generation are compared to various crystal morphology features through 2D estimates of length scale, perimeter and irregularity. It is observed that crystals grown in the lab, featuring sharp geometric facets, exhibit a higher probability of significant heat generation than inclusions with more spherical shapes. However, no statistical link is found between the rates of heat generation and the crystal morphology in those samples that do generate significant heating, likely because variations in surface roughness cannot be entirely eliminated during experimentation.

The government agencies in various countries are equipped with the devices that can detect explosives. However, often they are bulky in nature and they are publicly visible and expensive. Therefore it is not feasible to use them in the present condition in public places such as railway stations, airports, bus stations and so on.

This method uses a controlled flow of vapor from a solid-phase HMTD source that is presented to an ambient-pressure-ionization mass spectrometer equipped with a secondary-electrospray-ionization (SESI) source. The subpart-per-trillion sensitivity of this system enables direct detection of HMTD vapor through an intact [M + H]+ ion in real time at temperatures near 20°C. By calibrating this method using vapor sources of cocaine and heroin, which have known pressure-temperature (P-T) curves, the temperature dependence of HMTD vapor was determined, and a Clausius-Clapeyron plot of ln[P (Pa)] vs 1/[T (K)] yielded a straight line with the expression ln[P (Pa)] = {(-11091 ± 356) × 1/[T (K)]} + 25 ± 1 (error limits are the standard error of the regression analysis). From this equation, the sublimation enthalpy of HMTD was estimated to be 92 ± 3 kJ/mol, which compares well with the theoretical estimate of 95 kJ/mol, and the vapor pressure at 20°C was estimated to be ∼60 parts per trillion by volume, which is within a factor of 2 of previous theoretical estimates. Thus, this method provides not only the first direct experimental determination of HMTD vapor pressure but also a rapid, near-real-time capability to quantitatively measure low-vapor-pressure compounds, which will be useful for aiding in the development of training aids for bomb-sniffing canines. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84948415520"

SEM and TEM images of the xerogels revealed that 3D networks consisting of numerous nanofibers were formed in the gels of TC3T and PC3P. It should be noted that the obtained xerogels based on TC3T and PC3P emit strong blue and bluish green light, respectively, under UV irradiation. Upon exposure to the vapors of TNT and DNT, the emission of TC3T and PC3P in nanofiber-based films can be quenched obviously. The steady-state Stern-Volmer plots reveal that the fluorescence quenching of carbazole derivatives induced by aromatic nitro compounds is due to photo-induced electron transfer.

Of critical importance is the selection of dogs that are emotionally suited for this highly specialized application. The goal of our study was to develop an emotional reactivity test (ERT) as a screening tool for the selection of IDDs. The ERT included a series of subtasks that expose each dog sequentially to visual, auditory, and experiential stimuli with an associated grading scale used by trained observers to rate individual dog responses. In this study, 16 Labrador retrievers that met initial selection criteria as candidate IDDs were assessed using the ERT, measurement of plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations (pre- and post-ERT), and an independent open-field test of anxiety in response to sound stimuli. Based on the sum of its responses, each dog was assigned an aggregate ERT score. Aggregate ERT scores from independent trained observers were highly concordant [Shrout-Fleiss's intraclass correlation (2,1)= 0.96] suggesting excellent inter-rater reliability. The aggregate ERT scores were also negativelycorrelated with the dogs' scores on the open-field anxiety test (Spearman rank correlation, n= 16, r=-0.57, P= 0.0214). In addition, there were significant increases in salivary (Wilcoxon signed rank, n=16, S= 38.5, P= 0.0458) and plasma (Wilcoxon signed rank, n= 16, S= 68, P < 0.0001) cortisol levels after the ERT, compared with baseline, suggesting that exposure to the ERT test elements produced a physiological stress response. We conclude that the ERT is a useful pre-training screening test that can be used to identify dogs with a low threshold of emotional reactivity for rejection, and dogs with a high threshold of emotional reactivity for entry into the IDD training program. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-84924348248"

Catalytic influence was evident from the lowering of activation energy for the catalyzed decomposition reactions.

Described here is a comparison of the Alleghany Ballistic Laboratory (ABL) friction data and Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM) friction data for 19 HME and military standard explosives. Two methods were employed to reduce the data - modified Bruceton analysis (F50) and the threshold initiation level analysis (TIL). The study provides a full list of friction sensitivity data for the 19 materials by both ABL and BAM friction testing equipment. Specific results highlight the differences more than the similarities of the two methods. PETN and KClO3/sugar mixtures exhibit the most sensitivity of the materials studied by both testing methods. On the other hand, H2O2/fuel mixtures exhibit no sensitivity in ABL testing, but exhibit some sensitivity in BAM testing. For the UNi mixtures, the behavior was the opposite, no sensitivity in BAM but some sensitivity in ABL. KClO4/Al mixtures exhibit high sensitivity in the ABL method, but only moderate sensitivity in the BAM method. Other differences are seen in the relative sensitivities underscoring the differences in the mechanisms of how each test method operates. In some cases, data could not be attained because of the physical nature of the material. Comparison between the two friction methods on a material-by-material basis using absolute values not surprisingly yielded essentially no systematic correlations. Even the relative order showed little correlation between the two methods. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded this effort. Each participating testing laboratory uses identical test materials and preparation methods. However, the test procedures differ among the laboratories.

Following this need we have succeeded in using microthermal analysis to sensitively identify and discriminate between RDX and PETN explosive vapors at trace level. Once the explosive vapor is trapped in a porous material, heating the material at a fast rate of 3000 K/s up to 350 °C will result in a thermal pattern specifically corresponding to the explosive and its interaction with the porous material. The explosive signatures obtained make it possible to simultaneously identify the presence and the nature of the explosive vapor in just a few milliseconds. Therefore, this also allows the development of multitarget devices using porous material for capturing the vapor combined with microthermal analysis for fast detection and identification.

A combination of laser-induced breakdown (LIB) and selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) methods was used. The surface of the bulk samples was irradiated by a sequence of 10 laser pulses, 150 mJ each, in an argon atmosphere to simulate the explosion or combustion on a microscopic laboratory scale. The gas from the reaction zone was analysed in real time by SIFT-MS. The concentrations of the decomposition products (NH3, HCN, HCHO, NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, DMNB, C2H6CO, C2H2 and nitroglycerine) were determined and statistically processed using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). The results revealed that there are similarities in the quantitative compositions of the decomposition products for similar explosives and similar propellants. PCA visualisation highlights that characteristic combinations of compounds correspond to the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitrocellulose-based propellants (including trade mark Lovex), and different combinations correspond to various plastic explosives (trade mark Semtex).

Non-aromatic hantzsch 2, 4-dihydropyridine ester (DHPE) is proposed here as a reducing agent and in turn through the acquirement of aromaticity, DHPE provides a general route for the fast synthesis of these bimetallic nanoparticles. The Au-M (M=Pd, Pt) nanostructures are of typically core-shell type structure where Au forms the core and the shell is made of either Pd or Pt. Overwhelmingly, the same synthetic strategy leads to the formation of alloy nanostructures for Pd-Pt. The growth kinetics, reaction mechanism as well as the morphology of the particles could be supported with the redox properties of the precursor salts. The well-recognized catalytic activity of both Pt and Pd has been capitalized here in Pd-Pt alloy particles, which bring synergistic effect to engender its highest electrocatalytic performance and stability towards ethylene glycol oxidation reaction in comparison to the other electrocatalysts (Au-Pd, Au-Pt and commercial Pt/C).

The ability of Si4Pic+Cl- to adsorb anionic metal complexes such as AuCl4- ions allowed well-dispersed nAu to be obtained with an average particle size of 4.5nm. The liquid suspension of nAu-Si4Pic+Cl- was deposited by the drop coating method onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface to build a sensor (nAu-Si4Pic+Cl-/GCE) which was used for the detection of o-nitrophenol (o-NP) and p-nitrophenol (p-NP). Under optimized experimental conditions the reduction peak current increased with increasing concentrations of both nitrophenol isomers in the range of 0.1-1.5μmolL-1. The detection limits were 46nmolL-1 and 55nmolL-1 for o-NP and p-NP, respectively.

The heat of detonation of the explosive compound, peak pressure, and temperature of the blast wave are important blast parameters. A blast wave generated due to explosion propagates into the air medium at supersonic speed until the pressure in the blast zone is released completely. The intensity of the impact by the blast wave on any intervening solid object depends on the blast parameters and the speed of propagation of the blast wave. A theoretical analysis is carried out to predict the pressure produced in the expanding blast zone as function of distance and time by analytically solving the governing equations. The initial peak pressure and temperature of blast wave, which are required in the theoretical analysis, were calculated making use of the blast wave theory. For comparison, experiments were conducted by detonating different weights of high explosives, and pressures were recorded at various distances from the blast point.

Those simulations consisted of simplified target geometry; artificially collimated neutron source; and generalized organic, hydrogenous, or metallic types of cargo materials. In this study, the MCNP5 simulation was expanded to include a more accurate representation of the neutron source, target geometry, detector response, and realistic and varied container contents. The flags found using the earlier simulations were applied to the more realistic scenario models in order to determine the feasibility of the use of flags in a detection algorithm. Additional flags utilizing the simulated detector response were also investigated. The conditions under which specific flags were preferable were also examined. It was found that many flags performed well independent of the cargo type while others, such as those using only neutron backscatter, were more highly dependent on cargo type.

However, challenges arising from the acquisition, storage, handling, and transportation of explosives have given rise to the development of ""pseudo-explosive"" training aids. These products attempt to emulate the odor of real explosives while remaining inert. Therefore, a canine trained on a pseudo-explosive should respond to its real-life analog. Similarly, a canine trained on an actual explosive should respond to the pseudo-explosive as if it was real. This research tested those assumptions with a focus on three explosives: single-base smokeless powder, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and a RDX-based plastic explosive (Composition C-4). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with solid phase microextraction as a pre-concentration technique, we determined that the volatile compounds given off by pseudo-explosive products consisted of various solvents, known additives from explosive formulations, and common impurities present in authentic explosives. For example, simulated smokeless powders emitted terpenes, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, diphenylamine, and ethyl centralite. Simulated TNT products emitted 2,4- and 2,6-dinitrotoluene. Simulated C-4 products emitted cyclohexanone, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and dimethyldinitrobutane. We also conducted tests to determine whether canines trained on pseudo-explosives are capable of alerting to genuine explosives and vice versa.

Accurate ion discrimination depends on the precise solution of nonlinear relationships and is essential for accurate identification of ion species for applications. So far, all the nonlinear relationships of ionmobility obtained are based at low electric fields (E/N <65 Td). Microchip FAIMS (μ-FAIMS) with small dimensions has high electric field up to E/N= 250 Td, making the approximation methods and conclusions for nonlinear relationships inappropriate for these systems. In this paper, we deduced nonlinear functions based on the first principle and a general model. Furthermore we considered the hydrodynamics of gas flow through microchannels. We then calculated the specific alpha coefficients for cocaine, morphine, HMX, TNT and RDX, respectively, based on their FAIMS spectra measured by μ-FAIMS system at ultra-high fields up to 250 Td. The results show that there is no difference in nonlinear alpha functions obtained by the approximation and new method at low field (<120 Td), but the error induced by using approximation method increases monotonically with the increase in field, and could be as much as 30% at a field of 250 Td.

This is the second paper to report the testing data on monolithic tempered glass windows. While the first paper reports the glass panel response and failure modes, the current paper concentrates on the glass fragments induced by the blast loadings. Thermally tempered glass has been often adopted for monolithic windows to reduce ejecting fragment hazards after window fracture. However, previous blast tests conducted on monolithic tempered glass reported that in addition to small cubic fragments the shattered glass panes could break into large and jagged fragments similar to the cases in annealed glass which poses much more debris threats than expected. A thorough study on tempered glass fragments produced by air blast pressure is therefore necessary for better protection of human safety. In this paper, fragment characteristics of monolithic tempered glass windows observed in blasting tests are analyzed and presented. 1.5. m × 1.2. m monolithic panes of two commonly used thicknesses, i.e. 6. mm and 10. mm, fully clamped onto the opening of an enclosed RC frame were tested with 5-10. kg TNT charge detonated at 4.5-12.3. m stand-off distances. Glass fragment mass and splash distributions both in front of and behind the windows were evaluated with respect to reflected pressure and glass specification. Fragment size and shape were also analyzed. High-speed cameras were used to monitor glass window fracture processes. Fragment velocities were determined by post-processing the high-speed camera images. Fragment ejecting velocities were evaluated with respect to the reflected impulse. Negative pressure was found to significantly influence the fragment ejecting velocity and fragment splash distributions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84903483817"

Here we focused on the discrimination of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), an explosive with military and civilian applications, using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratios. Our goal was to understand some of the factors influencing the isotope ratios of commercially manufactured PETN. PETN was isolated from bulk explosives using preparative HPLC, which reduced chemical and isotopic within-sample variability. We observed isotope ratio variation in a survey of 175 PETN samples from 22 manufacturing facilities, with δ13C values ranging from -49.7% to -28.0% and δ15N values ranging from -48.6% to +6.2%. Both within-sample variability and variation of PETN within an explosive block were much smaller than between-sample variations. Isotopic ratios of PETN were shown to discriminate explosive blocks from the same manufacturer, whereas explosive component composition measurements by HPLC were not able to do so. Using samples collected from three industrial PETN manufacturers, we investigated the isotopic relationship between PETN and its reactants, pentaerythritol (PE) and nitric acid. Our observations showed that δ13C values of PETN were indistinguishable from that of the reactant pentaerythritol. Isotopic separation between nitric acid and PETN was consistent within each sampled manufacturer but differed among manufacturers, and was likely dependent upon reaction conditions. These data indicate that δ13C variation in PETN is dependent on δ13C variation of PE supplies, while δ15N variation in PETN is due to both nitric acid δ15N and reaction conditions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84907509208"

The dynamic strength of concrete material is normally higher than the static strength. Based on extensive experimental data, a number of empirical DIF (dynamic increase factor) relations have been proposed to model concrete material strength increment at high strain rates. Most of these empirical relations are obtained by fitting the scattered dynamic testing data. It is commonly acknowledged that the induced structural effects such as lateral inertia confinement effect are inevitable in high-speed impact tests. Therefore directly fitting the laboratory testing data may not necessarily obtain the true dynamic concrete material properties. Some recent studies investigated the contributions of lateral inertia and end friction confinement effects on DIF of concrete materials in laboratory tests, and proposed relations to remove these influences to obtain the true DIF for concrete materials. The present study carries out numerical simulations of a reinforced concrete wall under different blast loadings. Different DIF relations including CEB defined DIF, DIF proposed in previous studies after removing structural effect in laboratory tests, and NO DIF, i.e., neglecting dynamic strength increment, are considered in numerical simulations. Verification of the numerical model is made through the comparisons of the numerical simulation results with field test data. The results demonstrate that using the new DIF model yields the best prediction of the structural responses. The responses of a typical RC wall under blast loads with a 5. m stand-off distance but different TNT explosive charge weights are also simulated using different DIF relations. The responses of RC wall obtained from numerical models with different DIF relations of concrete material are compared. From the numerical simulation results, the range of scaled distance that DIF relation has significant influences on the numerical simulation results is identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84901054491"

The explosives were found to be ammonium-nitrate based, as shown from the preliminary analysis of water soluble residues and ion-chromatographic experiments. The characteristic features of the explosives, i.e. the absence of fuel oils and presence of the waxes, were confirmed from gas chromatography-mass spectrometric measurements of the acetone-soluble and ether-soluble extracts of the explosive residues. The presence of wax was also confirmed from fluorescence measurements of the ethereal extracts and comparative studies of TICs of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of normal waxes and wax in the ethereal extracts of the experimental samples. But the most important aspect of the study was the presence and identification of a biomarker 28-Nor-17.beta.(H)-hopane both in normal wax samples and fire debris residues. The results conclusively showed the ordinary wax to be the fuel, and the source of the fuel was the same in all cases. Mass spectra of 28-Nor-17.beta.(H)-hopane was confirmed by library matching.

The synthesized materials were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The resulting nano-MMIP particles were suspended in TNT solution and then collected on the surface of a carbon paste electrode via a permanent magnet, situated within the CP electrode. The extracted TNT was analyzed on the CP electrode by applying square wave voltammetry (SWV). It was found that the oxidative signal of TNT is much favorable for TNT detection on the resulting magnetic carbon paste electrode. The electrode with nano-MMIP showed distinctly higher signal to TNT, compared to that containing magnetic non-imprinted polymer (MNIP) nanoparticles. All parameters influencing the method performance including extraction pH, extraction time and sorbent amount were evaluated and optimized.

A single S 2p core level doublet is observed for 4-mercaptobenzoic acid and 11-(1-pyrenyl)-1-undecathiol, which is assigned to the S-Au bond. The S 2p core level for l-cysteine, 6-mercaptohexanol, and DL-thioctic acid consist of two doublets, where one is S-Au bond and the other is the S-Zn bond.

In spite of considering barrier detectors based on AIIIBV bulk compounds and type-II superlattices as having theoretically a better performance than those based on HgCdTe, the latter compound is also used to fabricate barrier detectors.

In FNRR, the neutron energy spectrum transmitted through an object carries information about the elemental composition of thatobject. The principal elements present in most explosives are: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen andhydrogen. Explosives are characterized by high fractions of nitrogen and oxygen as well as low fractions of carbon and hydrogencompared to benign materials. Detection of explosives in cargo employing FNRRis based on determination of the local areal densities of these four elements and their ratios. In our measurements, the transmission spectrum is usually divided in 100 - 500 energy bins, representing 100 - 500 linear equations containing four unknown areal densities of HCNO. This is an overdetermined problem, which allows us to derive not only the fourexpectation values of their areal densitiesbut theirprobability distribution as well. For this purpose, a model was formulated and implemented within a software package which performs Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC).

To address known deficiencies of metal detectors and x-rays, an UWB 3D microwave imaging scanning apparatus using FMCW stepped frequency working in the K and Q bands and with a planar scanning geometry based on an x y stage, has been developed to screen suspicious luggage and footwear. To obtain microwave images of the concealed weapons, the targets are placed above the platform and the single transceiver horn antenna attached to the x y stage is moved mechanically to perform a raster scan to create a 2D synthetic aperture array. The S11 reflection signal of the transmitted sweep frequency from the target is acquired by a VNA in synchronism with each position step. To enhance and filter from clutter and noise the raw data and to obtain the 2D and 3D microwave images of the concealed weapons or explosives, data processing techniques are applied to the acquired signals. These techniques include background subtraction, Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), thresholding, filtering by gating and windowing and deconvolving with the transfer function of the system using a reference target. To focus the 3D reconstructed microwave image of the target in range and across the x y aperture without using focusing elements, 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) techniques are applied to the post-processed data.

The results are often represented as run distance or time versus input shock pressure on Pop plots. In practice, however, input shocks to explosives are often not 1D. Instead, they may be oblique or non-planar. Here, we present results from a series of experiments in which a PBX 9502 slab was bonded on one side to a PBX 9501 slab. The faster detonation in the PBX 9501 slab drove an oblique shock in the PBX 9502. The result was a two-dimensional (2D) shock structure consisting of a region of delayed reaction, referred to as an initiating layer, immediately adjacent to the PBX 9501/9502 interface, and a transition to detonation further from the interface. The initiating layer thickness varied with the input shock pressure, which was controlled by the thickness of the PBX 9501 layer. The results of seven such tests are presented in run-time versus input-shock-pressure space and compared to Pop plots generated with data from 1D experiments. Good agreement was observed, with the 2D results showing similar run-times to detonation, but more scatter for a given input shock pressure. The good correlation between the 1D and 2D data suggests the transverse component of the initiating shock does not have a significant effect on the initiation physics. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Separate analysis of the AN component ions ammonium and nitrate would add discriminatory power to these techniques. METHODSAmmonium ions in dissolved AN solution were isolated from samples by precipitation using sodium tetraphenylborate solution. We tested the isolation of ammonium from nitrates using solutions of ammonium and nitrate salts with different 15N/14N isotope ratios. Ammonium tetraphenylborate and AN were separately analyzed for their 15N/14N isotope ratios using EA-ConFlo-IRMS, and the 15N/14N isotope ratios of the nitrate ions were calculated using mass balance. Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen isotope ratios were plotted as two separate variables. RESULTSIsolation of ammonium precipitate from solutions containing dissolved nitrates did not influence the nitrogen isotope ratios of test ammonium salts. A survey set of 42 AN samples showed that the ammonium and nitrate 15N/14N isotope ratios were not significantly correlated, and the paired mean differences were not statistically significant. Both ammonium and nitrate were depleted in 15N relative to their theoretical atmospheric sources. CONCLUSIONSIsolation of the ammonium ion from AN adds another dimension for the discrimination of forensic AN samples. This technique using sodium tetraphenylborate is robust and does not require specialized equipment. Our observations indicated that ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen have independent sources of isotopic variation. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-84901453689"

Molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensors have proved useful for the determination of different compounds in different matrices with the required sensitivity and selectivity. In this work, a highly sensitive and selective molecularly imprinted polymer with electrochemical capabilities for the determination of TATP has been developed. The molecular imprinting has been performed via electropolymerisation onto a glassy carbon electrode surface by cyclic voltammetry from a solution of pyrrole functional monomer, TATP template and LiClO4. Differential Pulse Voltammetry of TATP, with LiClO4 as supporting electrolyte, was performed in a potential range of −2.0 V to +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Three-factor two-level factorial design was used to optimise the monomer concentration at 0.1 mol·L−1, template concentration at 100 mmol·L−1 and the number of cyclic voltammetry scan cycles to 10. The molecularly imprinted polymer-modified glassy carbon electrode demonstrated good performance at low concentrations for a linear range of 82–44,300 μg·L−1 and a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.996. The limits of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) achieved were 26.9 μg·L−1 and 81.6 μg·L−1, respectively. The sensor demonstrated very good repeatability with precision values (n = 6, expressed as %RSD) of 1.098% and 0.55% for 1108 and 2216 μg·L−1, respectively.

In the quantum mechanical analysis, the B3LYP/6-311+G∗∗, B3LYP/aug-c-pVDZ, M06HF/aug-cc-pVDZ, and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ methods were employed for geometrical optimization and single point calculations of chemical properties of the compound. Such properties include highest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) - lowest occupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) separation, dipole moment, atomization energy, and vibrational frequencies. Experimental analysis and validation showed that the energy minimized structures acquired from the quantum mechanical analysis were very similar to those obtained by X-ray crystallography. The 6-NO2 groups twist out of plane with respect to the benzene ring in both the crystallographic and energy minimized structures. The 4-NO2 group exhibits co-planarity with the phenyl ring in both the crystallographic and energy minimized structures as well. Unlike TNT, however, the energy barrier to orthogonal conformation is only 3.8 kcal/mol. In addition, considerable discrepancies between results obtained from the MP2 and B3LYP methods were observed, which suggest that it has to be very careful when applying B3LYP method to study such class of compounds. Through this study, a more accurate description of the chemical properties of dispersion-dominated aromatic systems was acquired.

Nanothermites have twice the energy density of 2,4,6-trinitroluene, and their nanostructures, functions, energy release, and reaction performance are continuously being improved. However, these materials suffer from low pressure because of low gas expansion from the reaction and incapability of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). Fast DDT is necessary to substantially improve the reaction velocity and output pressure not only of nanothermites but also of other monomolecular organic energetic materials, such as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and octogen. Accordingly, this study aims to produce energetic composites material that are safe, green, and free from heavy metals. A strategy of rapid DDT acceleration is proposed by fabricating quasi-core/shell structured materials of RDX@Fe2O3-Al based on Fe2O3-Al nanothermites. A surface modifying and ultrasonic synthesis technology is also demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations prove that the material comprises an RDX core and an Fe2O3-Al nanothermite shell. Results of closed vessel combustion tests show that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al combustion velocity accelerates to an average pressurization rate of 2.527MPa/μs. DDT tube tests further confirm that DDT accelerates to a primer explosive level in which the run-to-detonation distances of DDT is below the test-condition limitation (<15mm). Sensitivity tests also reveal that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite has low sensitivity to impact, friction, and electric spark. Therefore, the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite with a quasi-core/shell structure is a potential green and safe fast DDT energetic material that is easy to synthesize and applicable to other quasi-core/shell structures. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84920084561"

The two-dimensional model is constructed in full two-phase, and based on a highly coupled system of partial differential equations involving basic flow conservation equations and some constitutive relations borrowed from some one-dimensional studies that appeared in open literature. The whole system is solved using an optimized high-order accurate, explicit, central-difference scheme with selective-filtering/shock capturing (SF-SC) technique, to augment central-diffencing and prevent excessive dispersion. The sources of the equations describing particle-gas interactions in terms of momentum and energy transfers make the equation system quite stiff, and hence its explicit integration difficult. To ease the difficulties, a time-split approach is used allowing higher time steps. In the paper, the physical model for the sources of the equation system is given for a typical explosive, and several numerical calculations are carried out to assess the developed code. Microscale intergranular and/or intragranular effects including pore collapse, sublimation, pyrolysis, etc. are not taken into account for ignition and growth, and a basic temperature switch is applied in calculations to control ignition in the explosive domain. Results for one-dimensional DDT phenomenon are in good agreement with experimental and computational results available in literature. A typical shaped-charge wave-shaper case study is also performed to test the two-dimensional features of the code and it is observed that results are in good agreement with those of commercial software. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84897552261"

After detonation, the shockwave quickly strikes nearby structures. The bubble oscillation may then substantially damage the structures, even if the bubble pulse is not large.

This study applied the Eulerian Technique using ABAQUS software to simulate the process of underwater bubble explosion, pulsation and collapse. This approach allows many materials to be used in an Eulerian element and manages with large deformation of materials such as flows and gases. The simulated bubble is equivalent to a bubble generated by 55 g of TNT.

In both cases (either CMO or CE), the sensor surfaces are chemically functionalized with a layer of APhS (trimethoxyphenylsilane) molecules, which give the strongest sensor response for TNT. The construction and calibration of a vapour generator is also presented. The measurements of the sensor response to TNT are performed under equal conditions for both systems, and the results show that CE system with ultrasensitive electronics is far superior to optical detection using MEMS. Using CMO system, we can detect 300 molecules of TNT in 10+12 molecules of N2 carrier gas, whereas the CE system can detect three molecules of TNT in 10+12 molecules of carrier N2. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","2-s2.0-84903434098"

A method based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been used in this study. Excitation and ionization of TNT molecules has been occurred at atmospheric pressure. A dependence of TNT ion spectrum on standing time of TNT molecules on pSi surface has been demonstrated. The ion type has changed from (TNT-H) - to (TNT-NO2) - which indicates a slow chemical reaction between pSi surface and TNT molecules. The first step of (TNT-NO2) - formation has been found to be a result of laser stimulated surface dissociation and subsequent desorption of a neutral TNT-NO2 fragment. The second step of (TNT-NO2) - formation is a capture of an electron emitted from the pSi surface under laser irradiation.

The increased interest in improving the safety of operations has been driven largely by a series of recent catastrophes that have occurred in the United States and the rest of the world. A continuous review of past incidents and disasters to look for common causes and lessons is an essential component to any process safety and loss prevention program. While analyzing the causes of an accident cannot prevent that accident from occurring, learning from it can help to prevent future incidents. The objective of this article is to review a selection of major incidents involving ammonium nitrate in the last century to identify common causes and lessons that can be gleaned from these incidents in the hopes of preventing future disasters. Ammonium nitrate has been involved in dozens of major incidents in the last century, so a subset of major incidents were chosen for discussion for the sake of brevity.

By decreasing the pulse width of a femtosecond laser from 80 to 35fs, a molecular ion was drastically enhanced and was measured as one of the major ions in the mass spectrum. The detection limits obtained using the molecular (M+) and fragment (C2H3O+) ions were similar or slightly superior to those obtained using conventional mass spectrometry based on electron and chemical ionization. In order to improve the reliability, an isotope of TATP, i.e., TATP-d18, was synthesized and used as an internal standard in the trace analysis of TATP in a sample of human blood. TATP could be identified in a two-dimensional display, even though numerous interfering compounds were present in the sample.

In spark ignition, a monolayer of powder was placed on a conductive substrate and heated in air by a pulsed electrostatic discharge. In shock ignition, an individual particle was targeted by a miniature, laser-driven flyer plate accelerated to a speed in the range of 0.5-2 kms-1. In both experiments, time-dependent optical emission produced by the ignited material was monitored and recorded. The heating rates achieved in the present experiments are on the order of 109--1011 Ks-1. These ignition methods result in a very fast combustion with characteristic burn times reduced by 1-3 orders of magnitude compared to the burn times measured previously for the same material ignited in the CO2 laser beam, where it was heated at a much lower rate of about 106--10 7 Ks-1.

Incorporating processing and deposition into a single step, especially if no organic solvents were used, could allow nanothermites to be applied safely in a wider range of applications. This work reports on the performance and characterization of direct-deposited water processed nanothermite inks on semiconductor bridge (SCB) initiators. Specifically, it investigates the replacement of nanothermites processed by resonant mixing (Resodyn LabRAM) in the solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with nanothermites processed in water. Processing safety and mixture performance were then characterized. It was found that water processed nanothermites were stable for up to 480 min in a water bath at 50°C only if both metal and metal oxide particles were coated with palmitic acid. In addition, water processed nanothermites were found to have better mixing intimacy, which resulted in better performance than nanothermite processed in DMF. Direct deposition of water processed nanothermites also mitigates electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity, while the material remains wetted, improving processing safety dramatically. For the system investigated, it was found that processing at a solids loading of 30 vol.% resulted in a high density, high performance ink that was deposited directly onto the SCBs. This resulted in a 25% reduction in the all fire threshold over traditional energetics. This mixing approach uses an environmentally friendly mixing medium, can result in a higher density final material, and allows safe one-step mixing and deposition. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thus, a Raman switch concept by the Raman readout of PABT for the detection of TNT was proposed. The AgNPs paper at different sites exhibited a highly uniform sensitivity to TNT due to the layer-by-layer printing, and the sensitive limit could reach 1.6 × 10-17 g/cm2 TNT.

However, all previous designs have been based on passively excited surface plasmons, in which sensitivity is intrinsically limited by the low quality factors induced by metal losses. It has recently been proposed theoretically that surface plasmon sensors with active excitation (gain-enhanced) can achieve much higher sensitivities due to the amplification of the surface plasmons. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active plasmon sensor that is free of metal losses and operating deep below the diffraction limit for visible light. Loss compensation leads to an intense and sharp lasing emission that is ultrasensitive to adsorbed molecules. We validated the efficacy of our sensor to detect explosives in air under normal conditions and have achieved a sub-part-per-billion detection limit, the lowest reported to date for plasmonic sensors with 2,4-dinitrotoluene and ammonium nitrate. The selectivity between 2,4-dinitrotoluene, ammonium nitrate and nitrobenzene is on a par with other state-of-the-art explosives detectors. Our results show that monitoring the change of the lasing intensity is a superior method than monitoring the wavelength shift, as is widely used in passive surface plasmon sensors. We therefore envisage that nanoscopic sensors that make use of plasmonic lasing could become an important tool in security screening and biomolecular diagnostics. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","2-s2.0-84905866838"

This work describes an approach to lowering some risks associated with the handling of TATP in the laboratory through the use of an analog species, tripentanone triperoxide (TPTP). Sensitiveness has been tested via standard methods. GCMS analysis has shown that TPTP degrades via similar mechanisms to TATP under a range of conditions. Slight differences in product composition were traced to side reactions which may also affect impurities present in homemade TATP synthesis. A pilot field trial was conducted to evaluate TPTP as a substitute for TATP in explosive detection dog (EDD) scent training.

Impact sensitivity, which refers to the vulnerability to explosion under external stimuli, measures the safety and reliability of an energetic material and is a critical property. Various efforts have been made to rationalize the impact sensitivity of different types of energetic materials. Since a chemical explosion is a chemical reaction dominated phenomenon, a comprehensive understanding of such explosive processes requires detailed information of chemical bonding and molecular interaction. Quantum chemistry provides a modern theory of chemical bonding and computational quantum chemistry is a powerful tool to investigate chemical phenomena. Even at the very beginning of computational quantum chemistry, researchers in the field of energetic materials have begun to apply quantum chemistry to explosive properties.

Characterization was performed via the mean threshold voltage. The results showed that the mean threshold voltage of exploding foil initiators was reduced by 16% when the foil bridge width was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.3 mm, which means that a reduced foil bridge width could decrease the mean threshold voltage of exploding foil initiators as suggested by theoretical analysis.

In order to avoid creating a mixture that can vary in homogeneity, energetic organic molecules can be directly bonded to high molecular weight metals, forming a single metal complex with Angstrom-scale separation between the metal and the explosive. To probe the relationship between the structural properties of metal complexes and explosive performance, a new series of energetic lanthanide complexes has been prepared using energetic ligands such as NTO (5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazole-3-one). These are the first examples of lanthanide NTO complexes where no water is coordinated to the metal, demonstrating novel control of the coordination environment.

However, investigation into the aging behavior of three compositions containing polyethylene glycol and nitroglycerine revealed that the propellant which included ammonium perchlorate degraded at a slower rate compared with the other materials. It was suggested that ammonium perchlorate might act as an oxygen inhibitor reducing the oxidation rate of the polyethylene glycol binder so decreasing the rate of the propellant decomposition. In addition, at temperatures of 80°C or lower, ammonium perchlorate initially appears to hinder acid hydrolysis of nitroglycerine which also slows down the degradation of polyethylene glycol based propellant. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We use the Mie scattering theory which is an exact solution of the scattering problem for spherical particles of arbitrary size. In this paper, we approximate the particles as spheres with an equivalent volume.

We also study the effect of air, solvent and other additive inclusions on the IR spectra. Finally, we address the effect of particle surface roughness. We show that all these parameters (size, inclusions, roughness) affect the scattering process which results in distortions to the IR spectra as compared to library values for bulk material. The effect of substrate on the IR spectra is not studied due to the limitations of the Mie scattering theory which was developed for isolated particles only.

The strength limit of NEPE propellants was tested by the uniaxial tension test. Based on the aging mechanism of the micro-phase structure and the macro-mechanical properties of NEPE propellants, the aging process was divided into three stages: post curing stage, microstructure gradual degradation stage and accelerated chemical aging stage. Because nitrate ester is hardly to decompose at ambient temperatures, the post cure of NEPE propellants only occurs at higher temperatures. Thus, the life prediction of NEPE propellants should ignore the time of post cure. The service life of NEPE propellants at ambient temperatures should be determined by the second stage of high temperature accelerated aging. By analyzing the tensile strength of NEPE propellants aged at 65, 70, 75, and 80°C, the service life prediction equation of NEPE propellants was established and the service life was predicted.

A way to modify the crystal quality of an energetic material is to structure the matter on the nanoscale: the crystals size reduction should induce impurity modifications in the particles. That is one of the reasons why interest in nanoenergetic compositions that contain high energetic material (≥90 wt-%) and an organic matrix (≤10 wt-%) that takes part in constraining the explosive to organize itself on the nanoscale arose. The key point is to find or synthesize the matrix. In the course of this study, first ammonium perchlorate compositions structured on the nanoscale were synthesized (150 nm AP particles (80 wt-%) dispersed in an organogel matrix (20 wt-%)). The formulation process was based on the impregnation of porous organogels with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium perchlorate followed by freeze drying.

These AP nanocompositions show better safety behavior during combustion than there equivalent macrocompositions, while they burn more rapidly, with no degradation of their impact and thermal sensitivity properties.

The functional fluorescent nanonets, which were highly stable in air, showed an 81% quenching efficiency towards TNT vapor (∼10 ppb) with an exposure time of 540 s at room temperature. The nice performance of the nanonets was ascribed to the synergistic effects induced by the specific adsorption properties of APTS, the fast charge transfer properties and the effective π-π interaction with pyrene and TNT of rGO. Compared to the analogues of TNT, the PVP/pyrene/APTS/rGO nanonets showed notable selectivity towards TNT and DNT vapors.

Due to the hygroscopy of AN, this HME is expected to be an intermediate electrical conductivity material (IECM), defined here as one having electrical conductivity greater than soils, which have conductivities 0.1 to 1000 mS•m1 but less than metals, which have electrical conductivities on the order of 10 MS•m1. Our preliminary experimental and numerical modeling have established that AN-containing HME in the subsurface can, in all likelihood, be detected by electromagnetic exploration geophysics techniques, specifically by ground penetrating radar (GPR) and by electromagnetic induction (EMI). The electromagnetic induction signatures of HME for these techniques are distinctive. For example, in the case of EMI, the maximum quadrature response frequencies for IECM targets have been found to be greater than 100 kHz. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905694004"

It was revealed that the samples were caked seriously and the particles tend to aggregate with obviously increased size when dried through ordinary drying in different liquids at 70°C, which also occurred after vacuum drying. The degree of caking and aggregation was enhanced with increasing temperature. The particles were prevented to grow and the samples were fluffy when supercritical drying, particularly freeze drying, was used. The mechanical sensitivities of the samples marked with I-HMX, O-HMX, and F-HMX, which had average sizes of 120.36μm, 1.18μm, and 0.16μm, respectively, were carried out. Compared with I-HMX, the friction, impact, and shock sensitivities of O-HMX were slightly lower, and a significant sensitivity decrease for F-HMX happened with specific values of 28 %, 42.8 %, and 56.4 %, respectively, which demonstrated significant safety improvement.

However, obtaining chemical selectivity in M/NEMS sensors using chemoselective interfaces has been a longstanding challenge. Despite their many advantages, M/NEMS devices relying on chemoselective interfaces do not have sufficient selectivity. Therefore, highly sensitive and selective detection and quantification of chemical molecules using real-time, miniature sensor platforms still remains as a crucial challenge. Incorporating photothermal/photoacoustic spectroscopic techniques with M/NEMS using quantum cascade lasers can provide the chemical selectivity without sacrificing the sensitivity of the miniaturized sensing system. Point sensing is defined as sensing that requires collection and delivery of the target molecules to the sensor for detection and analysis. For example, photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy, which combines the high thermomechanical sensitivity of a bimetallic microcantilever with high selectivity of the mid infrared (IR) spectroscopy, is capable of obtaining molecular signatures of extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules (tens of picogram). On the other hand, standoff sensing is defined as sensing where the sensor and the operator are at distance from the target samples. Therefore, the standoff sensing is a non-contact method of obtaining molecular signatures without sample collection and processing. The distance of detection depends on the power of IR source, the sensitivity of a detector, and the efficiency of the collecting optics. By employing broadly tunable, high power quantum cascade lasers and a boxcar averager, molecular recognition of trace explosive compounds (1 μg/cm 2 of RDX) on a stainless steel surface has been achieved at a distance of five meters. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905728348"

Current classifications neither describe this injury pattern well, nor correlate with management. There is need for a new classification, to aid communication between clinicians, and help evaluate interventions and outcomes. We propose such a classification, and present the results of an initial prospective evaluation. Patients and methods: The classification was developed by a panel of military surgeons whilst deployed to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Injuries were divided into five classes, by anatomic level. Segmental injuries were recognised as a distinct entity. Associated injuries to the intraperitoneal abdomen, genitalia and perineum, pelvic ring, and upper limbs, which impact on clinical management and resources, were also accounted for. Results: Between 1 November 2010 and 20 February 2011, 179 IED-related lower limb injuries in 103 consecutive casualties were classified, and their subsequent vascular and musculoskeletal treatment recorded. 69% of the injuries were traumatic amputations, and the remainder segmental injuries. 49% of casualties suffered bilateral lower limb amputation. The most common injury was class 3 (involving proximal lower leg or thigh, permitting effective above-knee tourniquet application, 49%), but more proximal patterns (class 4 or 5, preventing effective tourniquet application) accounted for 18% of injuries. Eleven casualties had associated intraperitoneal abdominal injuries, 41 suffered genital or perineal injuries, 9 had pelvic ring fractures, and 66 had upper limb injuries. The classification was easy to apply and correlated with management. Conclusions: The 'Bastion classification' is a pragmatic yet clinically relevant injury categorisation, which describes current injury patterns well, and should facilitate communication between clinicians, and the evaluation of interventions and outcomes. The validation cohort confirms that the injury burden from IEDs in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan remains high, with most casualties sustaining amputation through or above the knee. The rates of associated injury to the abdomen, perineum, pelvis and upper limbs are high. These findings have important implications for the training of military surgeons, staffing and resourcing of medical treatment facilities, to ensure an adequate skill mix to manage these complex and challenging injuries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84905491641"

Briefly, differential reflectometry (DR) shines ultraviolet (UV) and blue light on two close-by areas on a surface (for example, a piece of luggage on a moving conveyer belt). Upon reflection, the light is collected with a spectrometer combined with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. A computer processes the data and produces in turn differential reflection spectra taken from these two adjacent areas on the surface. This differential technique is highly sensitive and provides spectroscopic data of materials, particularly of explosives. As an example, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene displays strong and distinct features in differential reflectograms near 420 and 250 nm, that is, in the near-UV region. Similar, but distinctly different features are observed for other explosives. Finally, a custom algorithm classifies the collected spectral data and outputs an acoustic signal if a threat is detected.

There was a correlation between peak resolution and the number of nitro groups for the nitrobenzenes and nitrotoluenes. The nitro group distance from the methyl for the nitrotoluenes with two nitro groups showed some correlation to the ability to detect as well.

A robust and user-friendly portable platform with such capabilities increases the effectiveness of locating and identifying threats while reducing risks to personnel. In 2013 ChemImage Sensor Systems (CISS) introduced Aperio, a handheld sensor, using real-time SWIR HSI for wide area surveillance and standoff detection of explosives, chemical threats, and narcotics. That SWIR HSI system employed a liquid-crystal tunable filter for real-time automated detection and display of threats. In these proceedings, we report on a next generation device called VeroVision™, which incorporates an improved optical design that enhances detection performance at greater standoff distances with increased sensitivity and detection speed. A tripod mounted sensor head unit (SHU) with an optional motorized pan-tilt unit (PTU) is available for precision pointing and sensor stabilization. This option supports longer standoff range applications which are often seen at checkpoint vehicle inspection where speed and precision is necessary. Basic software has been extended to include advanced algorithms providing multi-target display functionality, automatic threshold determination, and an automated detection recipe capability for expanding the library as new threats emerge. In these proceedings, we report on the improvements associated with the next generation portable widefield SWIR HSI sensor, VeroVision™. Test data collected during development are presented in this report which supports the targeted applications for use of VeroVision™ for screening residue and bulk levels of explosive and drugs on vehicles and personnel at checkpoints as well as various applications for other secure areas.

The study was completed with coincidental detection at high vacuum of both optical emission and mass spectra originated from the same laser event. We have proposed probable fragmentation pathways for the compounds taking into account the reactions that prevail over other routes depending on experimental conditions: laser fluence, pressure and the surrounding atmosphere.

Tests were conducted with a PBX 9502 slab bonded on one side to a PBX 9501 slab. For each test, a detonation in the PBX 9501 was generated to drive an oblique shock intended to initiate the PBX 9502. Shocks of sufficient strength generated an initiating layer, or region of delayed reaction (relative to typical PBX 9502 detonation reaction timescales) in the PBX 9502 immediately adjacent to the PBX 9501. These reactions result in a transition to detonation away from the 9501/9502 interface in a process analogous to the shock-to-detonation transition in shocked one-dimensional (1D) explosive configurations. The thickness of the PBX 9501 layer was varied from 0.5-2.5. mm to control the strength and duration of the transmitted shock into the 8. mm thick PBX 9502. Phase velocities at the explosive outer surfaces, wave front breakout shapes, and post shock particle velocity histories associated with the detonating and initiating zones in the two explosives are reported and discussed. The initiating layer thickness decreased with increasing PBX 9501 thickness for tests with PBX 9501 thicknesses larger than 1.0. mm. A 1.0. mm thick PBX 9501 slab was not able to initiate detonation in the 8.0. mm thick PBX 9502 slab. Further decreasing the PBX 9501 thickness to 0.5. mm resulted in detonation throughout both slabs, with no initiating layer due to the intersection of each explosive's thickness effect curve at this condition. Initiating layers exhibited particle velocity profiles characteristic of non-detonating shocks.

Subsequent finger or palm friction ridge contact with a solid surface, and the application of sufficient pressure, results in particle depositions and particle crushing at the substrate surface within a finger or palm print. These particles and related materials provide an evidentiary trail which is useful for security applications both prior or post to detonation of an explosive device. As such, the optophysicochemical characteristics of these particles are of particular interest for trace explosives detection applications in DOD or DHS arenas. One limiting factor to forensics exploitation is the persistence of these particles so it is important to understand which factors significantly influence their sublimation or decomposition under different conditions. The longevity or stability of explosives particles on a substrate is a function of a range of environmental parameters or particle properties including: Chemical vapor pressure, particle geometry, temperature, airflow, relative humidity, condensation, inclusion chemicals, chemical adlayers, incident light, in some instances the substrate itself and as we show in this work the areal density of the particles covering the substrate. Here, we have studied particles of explosives as pure chemicals, deposited on a glass surface by particle sieving, by photomicroscopy to monitor their sublimation as a function of different experimental variables. Analysis of 2D microscopic images was used to compute and track particle size and geometrical characteristics as a function of time with different test conditions. In this preliminary work a limited set of different test conditions were employed including a range of areal coveragey for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), different particle sizes and a range of airflow rates. The humidity, temperature and substrate were kept constant for each particle type. To perform the experiments a custom flow cell was designed to accommodate a standard microscopy glass slide and to allow in-situ photomicroscopy. The fluidic airflow through the test cell was modelled and flows were selected to provide relevant flow velocities for static and moving applications. For a chemical of interest, we define the radial sublimation velocity (RSV) for the equivalent sphere of a particle as a parameter to characterize the sublimation rate of a material in particle form. The RSV is a useful parameter because it is independent of particle size. The sublimation rate for an ensemble of particles is found to significantly depend on airflow velocity and the areal density of the particles. To establish or estimate the persistence of particles in ambient air we conclude that the particle sizing, airflow conditions and areal density must be known. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905842645"

Under a continuous application of artificial rainwater, greater dissolved effluent concentrations of TNT and RDX (5- and 10-fold, respectively) were observed for the columns amended with microscale residues than for the columns amended with the mm-sized residues. This difference between microscale and mm-sized residues likely was due, in part, to dissolution of microscale particles entrapped in the sand column. Elution of particulate Comp B from the columns, based on the difference between total and dissolved explosives concentrations in column effluent, indicated higher and more frequent detections of particulate explosives in the columns amended with microscale Comp B than the columns amended with mm-sized Comp B. Examination of the vertical profiles of explosives in sand indicated that particulate residues had migrated into the sand, with a greater particulate mass observed in the columns which had received the microscale Comp B compared to those which received the mm-sized Comp B. These results indicate that both mm-sized and microscale detonation residues can contribute to the undissolved (e.g., particulate) Comp B transport into to the subsurface.

These methods extract features from known examples of target responses to train a statistical classifier. The statistical classifiers are then used to identify targets emplaced in previously unseen conditions. Due to the variation in target GPR responses caused by factors such as differing soil conditions, classifiers require training on a large, varied dataset to encompass the signal variation expected in operational conditions. These training collections generally involve burying each target type in a number of soil conditions, at a number of burial depths. The cost associated with both burying the targets, and collecting the data is extremely high. Thus, the conditions and depths sampled cover only a subset of possible scenarios. The goal of this research is to improve the ability of a classifier to generalize to new conditions by deforming target responses in accordance with the physical properties of GPR signals. These signal deformations can simulate a target response under different conditions than those represented in the data collection. This research shows that improved detection performance in previously unseen conditions can be achieved by utilizing deformations, even when the training dataset is limited. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905686512"

For one test (1 g TNT), gas burners instead of the usually employed 2-zone heating block, were used to intensify the test conditions.

Explosive detection dogs often perform prolonged periods of exercise and are reported to have chronic inappetance and weight-loss consistent with gastric disease. Seven privately-owned Labrador Retrievers trained for off-leash explosive detection activities were used to test the hypothesis that explosive detection dogs develop exercise-induced gastric disease while performing routine duties. Gastroscopy was performed on dogs before and after a 5-day exercise challenge designed to simulate routine military deployment activities. Five days of sustained submaximal exercise resulted in substantial gastric disease. These results demonstrate that dogs performing prolonged submaximal exercise consistent with off-leash explosive detection patrols are susceptible to exercise-induced gastric disease. Exercise-induced gastric disease may explain the anecdotal reports of poor thrift in these types of dogs during military deployment, and prophylactic acid suppression therapy should be considered in dogs participating in these activities. © 2014 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","2-s2.0-85038827768"

The velocity of the luminous front was measured both in the filled and unfilled region, and approached 1000 ms-1 in the unfilled region, independent of the fill length. This value is approximately a factor of two higher than the fastest velocity measured in the filled region, 606 ms -1, for the 10 cm filled tube. The velocity increase in the unfilled region ist likely due to the increased open porosity, which can support faster flow velocities for a given pressure gradient relative to that in the porous material. A high-speed color imaging pyrometer was used to thermally map the evolution of the flame in both regions. Near the luminous front in the filled section, the temperature was observed to rapidly increase in a 1-2 cm zone to a maximum value near 3200 K, and an average value near 3000 K was sustained in the wake well after the front passes and exits the tube. In partially-filled tubes, even for the lowest fill length of 2 cm, the intermediate and/or product species could be seen to expand forward and completely fill the tube with a sustained temperature of ca. 3000 K. This temperature did not decay during the expansion, suggesting that the material continues to react as it expands. The results raise several questions about what a burn tube experiment is really measuring; such as what fraction of the material has burned when the luminous front passes and what role open cracks or microstructures play in promoting transport.

Historically there has been evidence that the surface properties of PETN particles can be strongly influenced by the presence of homolog impurities of PETN, in particular, dipentaerythritol hexanitrate (diPEHN) and tripentaerythritol octanitrate (triPEON), although not many systematic studies characterizing such influence exist. In this work we employ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to measure mass-loss rates at elevated temperatures and show that doping with a small amount of diPEHN and triPEON can reduce the mass-loss rate from PETN single-crystal surfaces by as much as 35 % as compared to undoped crystals. Arrhenius plots of mass-loss rates as a function of temperature suggest that the reduction in evaporation is not due to the change in activation barrier of the molecular evaporation process, but perhaps due to the impedance to the receding motion of the steps by the immobile impurities on the surface. Removal of surface impurities through gentle washing with ethanol leads to enhanced mass-loss rate relative to pure PETN suggesting a roughened surface morphology. Some surface roughening in doped crystals is supported by Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of growth layers that show evidences of growth layer stacking and rough edges. We also find that a larger amount of impurity added to the original solution does not necessarily lead to a more highly doped crystal, which could perhaps be interpreted as PETN crystals being able to accommodate only up to a certain weight percent of homolog impurities.

The powders 2Al-3CuO and 8Al-MoO3 were placed in a sample holder and subjected to an electrostatic discharge from a discharging capacitor. Their optical emission was monitored. Two ignition modes were detected: immediate ignition of individual particles and delayed ignition of a cloud of aerosolized powder. Experiments addressed the effects of material composition and morphology, aging, energy input, layer thickness, and environment on the ignition mode and ignition delays. Prepared thermites were blended with pure metal powders to study ignition of such blends. Individual particle ignition was observed for samples prepared as monolayers in air and argon and for any samples in vacuum. For thicker samples in air and in argon, a delayed powder ignition mode was observed. The delays varied from 10 μs to several milliseconds. Powders of 2Al-3CuO had shorter ignition delays compared with 8Al-MoO3. For both materials, delays decreased for the powders prepared using longer milling times. For 2Al-3CuO, aged powders ignited after longer delays compared with the freshly prepared powders; however, shorter delays were observed for the aged 8Al-MoO3. Electrostatic discharge energy and layer thickness (except for a monolayer) did not affect the ignition delay. Blending nanocomposite thermites with Al and Ti powders reduced their electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity and caused longer ignition delays.

Five explosive mixtures in five different diameter tubes were used and the choice of the mixtures included those considered as ""stable"" with regular cellular pattern and ""unstable"" with highly irregular cellular pattern. Photodiodes spaced at regular intervals along the tube were used to measure the detonation velocity. Piezoelectric transducers were also used to record the pressure profiles. Smoked foils were used to register the cellular detonation structure. Away from the limits, the detonation is found to propagate at a steady velocity throughout the length of the tube and the fluctuations of the local velocity are generally small. For stable mixtures with high argon dilution, the onset of the detonation limits is indicated by an abrupt drop in the detonation velocity to about 0.4VCJ after a short distance of travel. The detonation may continue to propagate at this low velocity before decaying eventually to a deflagration wave. For deflagrations the optical detector sometimes failed to register a signal due to low luminosity of the front. In unstable mixtures, galloping detonations are observed only in small diameter tubes (e.g., D=12.7, 3.2 and 1.5mm). A large number of fairly reproducible cycles of galloping detonations can be observed in very small diameter tubes. In large diameter tubes (e.g., D=31.7 and 50.8mm), no galloping detonations are observed in all stable and unstable mixtures. For stable mixtures, no galloping detonations are observed even in small diameter tubes of D=3.2 and 1.5mm. Smoked foils records show that the cellular detonation structure changes from multi-headed to single-headed spin as the limit is approached. In a galloping detonation cycle, a decay from multi-headed to single-headed detonation is observed. However, the cellular structure vanishes for further decay of the galloping detonation to the low velocity phase of the galloping cycle. Although galloping detonations could be considered to define the boundary for detonation limits, this definition lacks generality since galloping detonations are not always observed in all mixtures and in all tube diameters. Thus the onset of single-headed spin is perhaps the most appropriate criterion of the detonation limits in tubes. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-84926277045"

It has long been known that an underwater explosion can cause significantly more damage to the targets in water than the same amount of explosive in air. While the physical processes during an underwater explosion and the subsequent response of structures are extremely complex, which involve lots of complex issues such as the explosion, shock wave propagation, shock wave-structure interaction and structural response. Hence a sophisticated numerical model for the loading and material responses would be required to enable more realistic reproduction of the underlying physical processes. In this paper, a fully coupled numerical approach with combined Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, incorporating the explosion processes, is performed. The RHT (Riedel-Hiermaier-Thoma) model including the strain rate effect is employed to model the concrete material behavior subjected to blast loading. Detailed numerical simulation and analysis of a typical concrete gravity dam subjected to underwater explosion are presented in this study.

The damage effect of these weapons on ship structures mainly comes from the blast wave and fragments. The motivation of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of blast wave and fragment impact loadings on the multi-layer protective structure. A protective structure model with four layers and a metal casing filled with TNT charge (MCTC) which was used to simulate the warhead of an anti-ship weapon were designed and manufactured. An experiment was conducted in which the MCTC exploded inside an empty cabin of the first layer of the multi-layer protective structure. The distribution of fragments and the equivalent bare charge of the MCTC were determined by a numerical method. From experimental results, the failure pattern of the multi-layer protective structure under the synergistic effect of blast wave and fragment impact loadings was presented. The synergistic effect for the stiffened plates was also presented in the experiment by comparing the deformation and the rupture of the air-backed and water-backed stiffened plates. On the other hand, the agreement between numerical results and experimental results validated the numerical method, which enabled the numerical model to be used to predict the response of a full scale structure under loadings of anti-ship weapons.

However, dogs have some limitations such as cost of training and time of conditioning. The possibility of using parasitic wasps for detecting explosives and narcotics has been developed. Moreover, wasps are cheap to produce and can be conditioned with impressive speed for a specific chemical detection task. We examined the ability of Nasonia vitripennis Walker to learn and respond to methyldisulfanylmethane (DMDS), a volatile discriminator of cadaver. The training aimed to form an association between an unconditioned stimulus (pupae) and the conditioned stimulus (odor source). After the training, the time spent by conditioned wasps in the DMDS chamber was measured. Statistical analysis showed that the increasing concentrations involved an increase in the time spent in the chamber containing DMDS.

The handler error may mislead the dog into false identification, and the probability to commit such an error is altered often by the handlers' stressful state. In the current study we have focused on stress characteristics and the handler-dog interface effects on the canine detection performance. For baseline evaluation, the handlers were tested for attention performance and anxiety level utilizing pre-pulse inhibition and startle response tests, respectively. Following this, the handlers were randomly assigned into three stress conditions (relevant or/and irrelevant to the detection task) and to a control condition. The dogs were videotaped during explosive detection task and the latency of detection as well as activity and velocity were measured using a custom-made computerized algorithm. Finally, post detection task, the handlers were re-tested for attention performance and anxiety level. Our results revealed that all stress conditions decreased the handlers' attention and elevated their anxiety level. However, stress improved the dogs' latency to detect the explosive, and likewise, increased the dogs' locomotor activity. Specifically, when exposing the handlers to stress that is irrelevant to the detection task, we were surprised to find that the dogs showed a superior performance across all measures. Focusing on the handler-dog interface, we found that when the handlers' anxiety level is elevated, the dog performance is improved. We postulate that since the handlers' exposure to stress elevated anxiety level and impaired their attention, it may have led to less control over the dog. Consequently, it allowed the dogs to 'take control' and manifest their training outcomes. This alleged locus of control transfer may explain the improved performance of the dogs, and further emphasizes the importance of the handler-dog interface. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84905904912"

The structure, sensitivity, polymorph properties, and thermal behavior of CL-20/TATB by coating and physical mixing were studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that submicrometer-sized TATB was compactly coated onto the CL-20 surface with coverage close to 100 %. The core-shell structure of CL-20/TATB was confirmed by observation of hollow TATB shell from the CL-20 core dissolved sample.

Thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), showing effects of TATB coating on the polymorph thermal stability and exothermic decomposition of CL-20.

The unrivaled sensitivity and selectivity of the canine nose have combined to make these animals an attractive choice for law enforcement, military, and private security applications. Although the efficacy of trained detector dogs is well-established, the question of which chemical compounds are responsible for causing a dog to recognize a particular odor and alert to it remains a subject of debate for several explosive formulations-including, perhaps most notably, Composition C-4. Previous studies have indicated that cyclohexanone, 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol are the chemicals that may cause canines to alert to C-4. This has led to the suggestion that these substances could be used as a substitute for genuine C-4 in the training, testing, and maintenance of explosives-detecting canines. In this paper, we present an alternative view. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with solid phase microextraction as a pre-concentration technique, we have discovered that 2-ethyl-1-hexanol off-gasses not only from C-4, but also from benign sources, such as the common plasticizers bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate, bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate, and bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; as well as several plasticized items common to our everyday world, including PVC tile, PVC pipe, electrical tape, and credit cards. This observation may potentially discourage the use of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol for training purposes. We also present the results of our own canine field trials focused on the detection of C-4.

In this study, the effect of temperature on pipe bomb containers (i.e., PVC, black steel and galvanized steel) containing low explosive fillers (i.e., Pyrodex and double-base smokeless powder (DBSP)) was investigated. Measurements of fragment velocity and mass were compared for similar devices exploded in the spring (low/high temperature was 8. °C/21. °C) and winter (low/high temperature range was -9. °C/-3. °C). The explosions were captured using high speed filmography and fragment velocities were plotted as particle vector velocity maps (PVVM). The time that elapsed between the initiation of the winter devices containing double-base smokeless powder (DBSP) and the failure of their pipe containers ranged from 5.4 to 8.1. ms. The maximum fragment velocities for these devices ranged from 332 to 567. m/s. The steel devices ruptured and exploded more quickly than the PVC device. The steel devices also generated fragments with higher top speeds. Distributions of fragment masses were plotted as histograms and fragment weight distribution maps (FWDM). As expected, steel devices generated fewer, larger fragments than did the PVC devices. Comparison to devices exploded in the spring revealed several pieces of evidence for temperature effects on pipe bombs. For example, the mean fragment velocities for the winter devices were at or above those observed in the spring. The maximum fragment velocity was also higher for the winter steel devices. Although there were no significant differences in mean relative fragment mass, the fragment weight distribution maps (FWDMs) for two winter devices had anomalous slopes, where lower energy filler caused more severe fragmentation than higher energy filler. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84896929360"

Addition of strong acids to TATP can cause an explosive reaction, while reaction with dilute acid reduces the decomposition rate so drastically that gentle destruction of TATP is impractical. However, combined use of dilute acid with slightly solvated TATP made gentle destruction of TATP feasible. Variables including acid type, concentration, solvent and ratios thereof have been explored, along with kinetics, in an attempt to provide a field-safe technique for gently destroying this homemade primary explosive. The preferred method is moistening TATP with an alcoholic solution (aqueous methanol, ethanol, or iso-propanol) followed by addition of 36 wt-% hydrochloric acid.

NMR sample tubes have been impregnated by an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO2). They were subsequently dried and examined by 14N quadrupole resonance. To our surprise, we were able to observe a signal at the right frequency (4.64 MHz, the highest frequency NaNO2 line). This implies that the material has been properly embedded but also that sodium nitrite was properly recrystallized. This latter point was more than speculative. Anyway, we could observe that it works for spruce, beech, ash, maritime pine, but not for oak (which is known to be difficult to impregnate). Instrumental parameters have been optimized for reducing the duration of the experiment. If the first measurements required around 4 h, we obtain at the present time acceptable results in about 2 min or less. In addition, we have designed a simple NLLS (Non Linear Least Squares) algorithm by which the spectral parameters of the NQR signal can be retrieved even if the peak is hardly visible in the frequency domain. Extensive measurements have been performed on NaNO2 recrystallized in spruce. They show, among other things, that the totality of NaNO2 which has penetrated the material has actually recrystallized and seemingly forever. Various assays have been carried out as a function of impregnation and drying conditions. The evolution of the width of the NaNO 2 line reflects defects in the crystal lattice of NaNO2 due probably to alteration of the wood structure upon drying. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","2-s2.0-84888312545"

The sensitivity of currently constructed detectors is often insufficient. The paper presents a description of an explosive vapors concentrator that improves the detection limit of some explosives detectors. These detectors have been developed at the Institute of Optoelectronics. The concentrator is especially dedicated to operate with nitrogen oxide detectors. Preliminary measurements show that using the concentrator, the recorded amount of nitrogen dioxide released from a 0.5 ng sample of TNT increases by a factor of approx. 20. In the concentrator an induction heater is applied. Thanks to this and because of the miniaturization of the container with an adsorbing material (approx. 1 cm3), an extremely high rate of temperature growth is achieved (up to 500 °C within approx. 25 s).

Amongst the multiple advantageous points of applying polymer films in this area is the fact that they are cheap material, so they can be applied on a broad scale for low cost.

Our endeavor is to trace any charge-transfer complex formation, which would definitely cause a recognizable change in their physical properties.

However an area of canine odor detection that remains under-studied regards a trained dog's perception of an explosive odor when more than one odorant is combined to produce a mixture. The first objective of our study was to determine whether training adult Labrador Retrievers (n=20) to detect the scent of chemically pure potassium chlorate (PC) was sufficient to produce generalization to PC-based explosive mixtures that contained a novel component. We found that the majority of dogs (87%) trained with pure PC alone did not correctly signal the presence of one or more of four PC-based explosive mixtures. Our second objective was to determine whether training dogs using the separated components found in the PC-based explosives would subsequently enhance detection. Dogs were then trained using a novel static odor delivery device that safely segregated the PC and non-PC components and presented a merged odor to the dog. A statistically significant improvement in percentage of dogs detecting PC-based mixtures after training with the separated components compared to training with PC alone was seen with Mixture 1 (27-100%, P<. 0.0001), Mixture 2 (40-81%, P= 0.0229), Mixture 3 (38-94%, P= 0.0004), and Mixture 4 (69-100%, P<. 0.005). The results of this study highlight the potential limitations of dogs trained to detect a single odor to then recognize the odor when mixed with other substances.

Less-sensitive ingredients in both explosives and propellants will ensure the protection of deployed troops against an unwanted reaction to an external stimulus on the munitions stockpile. In the US Army, current efforts are directed towards the development of melt cast insensitive explosive formulations. Various formulations, mainly based on DNAN and NTO, have been developed and are now being fielded. Our research goal is to measure the deposition rate of energetics compounds from various insensitive munitions detonation scenarios. Our hypothesis is that the relative insensitiveness of these formulations leads to slightly higher deposition rates than conventional explosive formulations. This paper describes detonation residues research on mortar rounds containing IMX-104 explosive. Analyses indicate that high-order detonation residues are slightly greater for this formulation than for conventional munitions. However, blow-in-place detonations (BIPs) resulted in much higher residues deposition, indicating that a larger donor charge is required for efficient detonation. The highly soluble compound NTO was particularly problematic, with BIP deposition approaching 95% of the original load.

Since the measurement of pressure and temperature at close proximity of point of detonation is difficult, theoretical modeling of underwater blast is of significant importance. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We report on a method for extracting the characteristic features of covered materials, including hexogen, in the range from 0.5 to 1.8 THz. This time-domain spectroscopy-based technique takes into account only part of the signal reflected from a covered sample and analyzes it by using the Fourier transform. The obtained power spectrum has distinctive peaks that correspond to peaks measured in the transmission configuration and can be used for further identification of the materials. © The Authors.

However, the inclusion of liquid NG presents both stability and performance problems: the NG may migrate from the propellant in storage, and it softens the propellant at high inclusion levels. In this work, the novel nitrate ester 1,4-dinitrato-2,3-dinitro-2,3bis(nitratomethylene) butane (SMX) is considered as a replacement for NG in a double base propellant. Thermochemical calculations indicate improved performance when compared with the common double base propellant JA2 at SMX loadings above 40 wt-%. Also, since SMX is a room temperature solid, migration may be mitigated. Both unplasticized and plasticized propellants were formulated to enable the study of the interaction of SMX with nitrocellulose. Thermal analysis of unplasticized propellant showed a distinct melt-recrystallization curve, which indicates that a solid phase solution is being formed between SMX and NC, and that SMX would not act as plasticizer. Analysis of propellant prepared with diethyleneglycol dinitrate (DEGDN) plasticizer indicates that the SMX is likely dissolved in the DEGDN. The plasticized material also showed similar hardness and modulus to JA2. Safety characterization showed that sensitivity is similar to JA2. In short, replacing NG with SMX results in a new family of propellants with acceptable safety characteristics and which may also offer improved theoretical performance. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) shows the self-sensitized FOX-7 becomes multiple layers and porous after heat treatment. N2 adsorbance measurements revealed that its specific surface area (6.754 m2g -1) is 20 times of the area of expanded ammonium nitrate. The SAXS tests further indicate the existence of a large amount of voids in self-sensitized FOX-7 and the pore size is about 30 nm, belonging to mesopore (2.0-50 nm). Based on the analysis of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), the self-sensitized porous FOX-7 consists of α-phase and a spot of γ-phase. The TG-DSC results show that the self-sensitized FOX-7 exhibits excellent thermal stability. The impact, frication and electrostatic spark sensitivities of self-sensitized FOX-7 also have considerable enhancement.

Peak pressure, impulse, shock energy, and bubble energy were obtained by analyzing the curves. The results show that the peak pressures of composite explosives decrease with increasing aluminum fiber contents. The shock impulse of the 30% aluminum fiber composite explosive is the highest in all composite explosives. The effects of the 20% and 40% composite explosives are nearly equal to that of the 30% explosive, and the different values of shock impulse among them do not exceed 5%. The specific shock energy of the 20% aluminum fiber composite explosive is the highest in all composite explosives.

Similar to other modern spectroscopic techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopy, NQR also relies heavily on statistical signal processing systems for decision making and information extraction. This chapter provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for detection, estimation, and classification of NQR signals. More specifically, the problem of NQR-based detection of illicit materials is considered in detail. Several single- and multi-sensor algorithms are reviewed that possess many features of practical importance, including (a) robustness to uncertainties in the assumed spectral amplitudes, (b) exploitation of the polymorphous nature of relevant compounds to improve detection, (c) ability to quantify mixtures, and (d) efficient estimation and cancellation of background noise and radio frequency interference. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","2-s2.0-84888352231"

It determines the effectiveness with which an explosive can fragment a shell. Nowadays, the sand test or sand crushing test is the preferred method for brisance measurements but there is no reliable method for the prediction of the brisance parameter. In this paper, a method for the prediction of the brisance through sand test for pure and mixed energetic materials as well as aluminized explosives is reported. It is based on the molecular structure of the desired compound and once the conclusion is established any experimental data is redundant. The calculated brisance relative to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (=100) shows good agreement with the measured values. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","2-s2.0-84899651073"

The detection system is composed of two units. The first unit is an X-ray machine which will indicate a location of interest and the second unit is a neutron based system. The motivation of this project is that the design is based on finding the location of the suspicious object inside the luggage by the first unit. This location will be the point of interest for the neutron based detection system. Since checks by the neutron based system are carried out for only suspicious baggage inspected by X-ray inspection system, occasional delays in the neutron based detection system should be acceptable.
