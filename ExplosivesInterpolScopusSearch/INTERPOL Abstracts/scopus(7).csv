For all measurements, the absorbance is found to peak during the early period of high reactivity of post-detonation gases. The characteristic attenuation length is less than 1 cm during the peak absorption period, and remains on the order of centimeters until a significant decrease in optical depth occurs about 160 μs after the detonation. These results suggest that, for gram-scale and larger aluminized charges, the optically thick assumption will most likely be valid for the period in which fireball luminosity is significant. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This is based on the rapid redox reaction of peroxides (hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, triacetone triperoxide and H2O2) with bromide at 55 °C. Consumption of bromide is indicative of the reduction of the R-O-O-R moiety, the appearance of Br2 was found for all except for triacetone triperoxide. The latter was found to breakdown to acetone which rapidly reacts with Br2 producing bromoacetones. The lack of Br2 production is unique to triacetone triperoxide. Double step chronoamperometry (E1 = 700 mV, E2 = 960 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl)) allows for the quantitation of bromine (Br2 + 2e- → 2Br-) and bromide (2Br- → Br2 + 2e-) respectively. The results yielded a detection limit of 8.5 μM for triacetone triperoxide with a sensitivity of 0.026 μA μM- 1. The detection limits of 16.3 μM and 14.9 μM were found respectively for HMTD and H2O2 based on the appearance of Bromine. These results indicate a possibility to develop a handheld sensor for TATP dermination. © 2009.","2-s2.0-71649115047"

A hydrogel-coated screen-printed electrode is used for the detection of the thermally desorbed TNT from a preconcentration device using rapid square wave voltammetry. Optimization of the preconcentration system for desorption of TNT and subsequent electrochemical detection was conducted yielding a desorption temperature of 120 °C under a flow rate of 500 mL min-1. Such conditions resulted in a characteristic electrochemical signal for TNT representing the multi-step reduction process. Quantitative measurements produced a linear signal dependence on TNT quantity exposed to the preconcentrator from 0.25 to 10 μg.

This is particularly true for TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), one of the most employed explosives in the 20th century and at the same time, because of its toxicity, a well known pollutant. In this work we describe the development of an indirect competitive ELISA with chemiluminescent detection (CL-ELISA) and of a lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on colloidal gold nanoparticle labels. A commercially available monoclonal antibody was used and 13 specially synthesized conjugates were tested. We optimized the assay by determining the optimal concentration of monoclonal antibody and conjugates and the influence of various non-specific factors such as: tolerance to organic solvents at different concentrations, the washing and competitive step time, and the cross-reactivity with related compounds. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the CL-ELISA were good (LOD and IC50 values in the ng mL-1 range, and CV value about 7%). It has been applied to real samples of various materials involved in a controlled explosion of an ""improvised explosive device"". Three extraction procedures were tested on these samples, all employing methanol as the solvent. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), developed by using the same immunoreagents, reached a detection limit of 1 μg mL-1 when tested on the same samples analysed by CL-ELISA. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-76849112881"

In the presence of nitroaromatic vapors, the fluorescence of the material was found to decrease due to the adsorption of nitroaromatic molecules on its specific adsorption sites. The sensor exhibited a large sensitivity to TNT or DNT at their vapor pressures (respectively 6 and 148 ppbv) and the detection threshold was evaluated on a laboratory test setup and was found to be 0.75 ppbv for TNT.

The heats of formation of the five compounds are calculated from isodesmic reactions by employing the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP, B3PW91, and B3P86) methods with 6-31G** and 6-311G** basis sets.

The design and synthesis of new annulated TTF-calix[4]pyrrole receptors with the goal of rigidifying the system to accommodate better ni- troaromatic guests is outlined.

Selectivity for TNT was accomplished by using molecularly imprinted sol-gel derived organic/inorganic films deposited on the surface of the waveguide sensing channel. Response varied greatly as a function of the sensing film composition and required the presence of a bridging structure possessing an aromatic group linking silicon centers. The most sensitive film was composed of bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene with binding sites for TNT prepared by the chemical removal of a covalently bound TNT template which was co-polymerized into the matrix. A continuous unidirectional phase shift was observed upon exposure to TNT which was only partially reversible. As a result, the limit-of-detection is a function of both vapor phase concentration and exposure time. Only 2.4 parts-per-trillion (volume) of TNT is required to reach a 0.5 degree phase angle change for 2 min exposure time using the optimized film composition. The sensor responds with much reduced sensitivity (<1000) to TNT structural analogues such as 2,4-DNT. The response to toluene is 6-orders of magnitude smaller than TNT, rapidly achieved equilibrium, and is completely reversible. Mass addition is insufficient to account for the magnitude of the interferometric response to TNT. The response mechanism is not clearly understood but may be due to reactions with amine groups in the imprinted binding pockets potentially coupled with anisotropic molecular organization of the sol-gel derived materials composed of bridging aromatic groups. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In an effort to provide a scientific basis for safe applications of industrial explosives in reactive mining grounds containing pyrite, ammonium nitrate decomposition, with and without the presence of pyrite, was studied using a simultaneous Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analyser (DSC-TGA) and a gas-sealed isothermal reactor, respectively. The activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of ammonium nitrate decomposition were determined to be 102.6 kJ mol-1 and 4.55 × 107 s-1 without the presence of pyrite and 101.8 kJ mol-1 and 2.57 × 109 s-1 with the presence of pyrite. The kinetics of ammonium nitrate decomposition was then used to calculate the critical temperatures for ammonium nitrate decomposition with and without the presence of pyrite, based on the Frank-Kamenetskii model of thermal explosion. It was shown that the presence of pyrite reduces the temperature for, and accelerates the rate of, decomposition of ammonium nitrate. It was further shown that pyrite can significantly reduce the critical temperature of ammonium nitrate decomposition, causing undesired premature detonation of the explosives. The critical temperature also decreases with increasing diameter of the blast holes charged with the explosive.

On the other hand, granular activated carbon (AC) particles in sizes of 1-2 mm in diameter were adhesively deposited on a PET film, and their surfaces were also coated with TiO2. The resulting three preparations (TiO2-, AC-, and TiO2/AC-PET films) were set up in an annular-flow reactor to treat aqueous solutions of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) in a batch-recirculation mode. The rate of DNP adsorption onto the TiO2/AC-PET film without UV irradiation was almost the same as that onto the AC-PET film, indicating that the attraction of DNP to AC was not lowered in the presence of TiO2 film. Observation of SEM photographs suggests that this result is attributed to the porous structure of the thin TiO2 film covering AC particles. The rate of DNP removal by the TiO2-AC PET film under UV irradiation was 2.9 times higher than that by the TiO2-PET film under UV irradiation, and was 1.1 times higher than the rate of DNP adsorption onto the AC-PET film. The rate of DNP removal by the AC-PET film decreased by 40% after six runs, while that by the TiO2/AC-PET film decreased by 22%. Durable experiments using the TiO2/AC-PET and AC-PET films clarified that the lifetime of the TiO2/AC-PET film is at least two times longer than that of the AC-PET film. This result suggests that DNP molecules are photocatalytically decomposed when passing through the porous TiO2-PET film, which lessens a burden of DNP adsorption on AC. Moreover, the DNP treatments in the batch-recirculation flow system suggested that the TiO2/AC-PET film saturated with DNP can be successfully regenerated at 60 °C. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Upon anodic potential scanning, HMTD irreversibly oxidized at ∼1.70 V vs Ag/Ag+ (10 mM) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, and the ECL profile was coincident with the oxidation potential of HMTD in the presence of ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) (Ru(bpy)32+) luminophore species, which showed a half-wave potential of 0.96 V vs Ag/Ag+. The addition of small amounts of AgNO3 (0.50-7.0 mM) into the HMTD/Ru(bpy)32+ system resulted in significant enhancement in HMTD ECL production (up to 27 times). This enhancement was determined to be largely associated with NO3- and was linearly proportional to the concentrations of NO3- and Ag+ in solution. Homogeneous chemical oxidations of HMTD by electrogenerated NO 3• and Ag(II) species proximity to the electrode were proposed to be responsible for the ECL enhancement.

By isotope analysis of RDX, the extent of biodegradation was found to reach up to 99.5% of the initial mass at a distance of 1.15-1.35 km down gradient from the contamination sources. A range of first-order biodegradation rates was calculated based on the degradation extents, with average half-life values ranging between 4.4 and 12.8 years for RDX biodegradation in the upper 15 m of the aquifer, assuming purely aerobic biodegradation, and between 10.9 and 31.2 years, assuming purely anaerobic biodegradation. Based on the geochemical data, an aerobic biodegradation pathway was suggested as the dominant attenuation process at the site. The calculated biodegradation rate was correlated with depth, showing decreasing degradation rates in deeper groundwater layers. Exceptionally low first-order kinetic constants were found in a borehole penetrating the bottom of the aquifer, with half life ranging between 85.0 to 161.5 years, assuming purely aerobic biodegradation, and between 207.5 and 394.3 years, assuming purely anaerobic biodegradation.

An ionic liquid (IL) BMIBF4 was used as both the electrolyte and the sorption solvent for the two-dimensional electrochemical and piezoelectric gas sensors. The electrochemical behaviors of these nitro compounds in BMIBF4 were studied by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and square wave voltammetry, in parallel. The electrochemical properties of these compounds resembled the electrochemical reduction processes in their aprotic solutions, showing first a reversible reduction process and then subsequently an irreversible reduction processes. The redox properties of these compounds also depend on the number of nitro groups and the position of the nitro groups on the benzene ring. Square wave voltammetry was used to quantitatively analyze the ENB in BMIBF4. Reduction peaks in the square wave voltammetric curves could be obtained when the concentrations were at ppm level. A small amount of moisture in the IL electrolyte did not significantly affect the redox behaviors. Piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrodes and the electrodes for amperometry were fabricated on a single piece of quartz plate. Detection of the volatile ENB vapor with this integrated EQCM chip was tested with both QCM and amperometric methods. The sensor's signal was related quantitatively to the ENB vapors adsorbed in BMIBF4 from air. Combining amperometric and QCM detection simultaneously can cross-validate the detection technology, reduce false positives and false negatives and increase the accuracy of the detection. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The thermal behaviors and chemical kinetic parameters of the above two propellants and their mixtures with water were analyzed by using a CALVET heat flux calorimeter, C80. The thermal decomposition mechanisms of these two propellants with water were conjectured based on the tests. And then, the self-accelerating decomposition temperatures (SADT) of these two propellants and their mixtures with water were calculated and compared according to the kinetic parameters and Semenov model. The results show that the thermal decomposition mechanism of double-base propellant with water may be changing with the varying moisture content by transferring hydrogen proton (H+). However, the thermal decomposition mechanism of multi-nitro ester propellant with water may be unchanging due to the excess of formaldehyde (HCHO). Water plays the external physical factor on the thermal decomposition of multi-nitro ester propellant, and it plays both the physical and the chemical factors on the thermal decomposition of double-base propellant. The SADTs of their mixtures with water are much lower than that of pure propellants, and keep decreasing with the increasing of moisture content. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The method uses very bright neutron pulses having duration of the order of 10 ns only, which are generated by dense plasma focus (DPF) devices filled with pure deuterium or DT mixture as a working gas. The small size occupied by the neutron bunch in space, number of neutrons per pulse and mono-chromaticity (1E/E ∼1%) of the neutron spectrum provides the opportunity to use a time-of-flight (TOF) technique with flying bases of about a few metres. In our researches we used DPF devices having bank energy in the range 2-7 kJ. The devices generate a neutron yield of the level of 108-109 2.45MeV and 1010-1011 14MeV neutrons per pulse with pulse duration ∼10-20 ns. TOF base in the tests was 2.2-18.5 m.

It was also used in the first World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993. It is difficult to identify urea nitrate in post-explosion debris, since only a very small fraction survives the blast. Also, in the presence of water, it readily decomposes to its original components, urea and nitric acid. It is suspected that post-blast debris of urea nitrate can be confused with ammonium nitrate, the main solid product of urea nitrate thermal decomposition. In a comprehensive study towards identification of urea nitrate in post-blast traces, a spectrophotometric technique for quantitative determination of urea nitrate was developed, and conditions were found for extraction and separation of un-exploded traces of urea nitrate with minimal decomposition.

HE samples were detected on stainless steel surfaces as thin films (2-30 μg/cm2) for SIRS experiments and as particles (3-85 mg) for SRS measurements. Nitroaromatic HEs: TNT, DNT, RDX, C4, and Semtex-H and TATP cyclic peroxide homemade explosive were used as targets.

The main advantage of taking solid samples with a wipe pad followed by thermal desorption is the low detection limit by enhanced vapor pressure. Single photon ionization is a soft ionization technique which reduces the target ion fragmentation and shields bulk components with high ionization energies (IE) like nitrogen yielding to clearly arranged mass spectra with significant high mass peaks. To obtain low false-positive and false-negative rates, especially necessary for security-relevant substances, the ion trap mass spectrometer allows identification of signals with MS/MS studies. In this concept, the soft ionization technique fits well with the MS/MS studies, as peaks with high masses are generated yielding significant MS/MS fragments. For the ionization, photon energies between about 8 eV (155 nm) and 12 eV (103 nm) were generated with electron-beam-pumped rare gas excimer lamps (EBEL). Depending on the rare gas used, light with different photon energy is generated, adapted to the substances of interest. So, even most narcotics, having relatively low IEs, can be ionized with 8.4 eV photons without massive fragmentation. For most explosives, photons with higher energy must be used as their IEs are higher. In this work, a mobile setup with a commercial ion trap mass spectrometer has been developed and tested. Even a first real-scenario measurement campaign was accomplished successfully proving the field-suitability of the system. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-70449554049"

Different potentially interfering organic materials were also analyzed. The residues were not uniformly distributed on an aluminum support and single-shot discrimination was attempted. For a single residue type, large shot-to-shot fluctuations of the line intensity ratios characteristic for organic samples were observed, which made material classification difficult. It was found that both atomic and molecular emission intensities, as well as their ratios, are strongly affected by an amount of the ablated support material, which mainly determines the plasma temperature. With respect to the spectra from the clean support, emission intensities of atomic oxygen and nitrogen are always reduced in the presence of an organic material, even if its molecules contain these elements. This was attributed to chemical reactions in a plasma containing carbon or its fragments. Hydrogen atomic emission depends strongly on the local humidity above the sampled point and its line intensity shows shot to shot variations up to 50%, also on a homogeneous sample. It is argued that shock waves generated by previous spatially and/or temporally close laser pulses blow away a relatively heavy water aerosol, which later diffuses slowly back towards the sampled point. C2 and CN exhibit a peak emission behavior with atomic Al emission, and their variable ratio indicates an existence of different formation or removal mechanisms from the plasma, depending on the plasma parameters and on the composition of the organic residue. On the basis of these observations, an attempt is made to establish a suitable procedure for data analysis and to determine the optimal experimental conditions, which would allow for discrimination of explosives from other, potentially interfering, residues. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Lewis acidity of silicon in conjugated poly(silafluorene-vinylene)s is shown to be important. This was established by examining the 29Si NMR chemical shifts (Δ) for the model trimer fragment of the polymer CH 3-silafluorene-(trans-C2H2)-silafluorene- (trans-C2H2)-silafluorene-CH3. The peripheral and central silicon resonances are up-field from a TMS reference at -9.50 and -18.9 ppm, respectively. Both resonances shift down-field in the presence of donor analytes and the observed shifts (0 to 1 ppm) correlate with the basicity of a variety of added Lewis bases, including TNT. The most basic analyte studied was acetonitrile and an association constant (K a) of 0.12 M -1 was calculated its binding to the peripheral silicon centers using the Scatchard method. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1) of 5.86(3) and 4.83(4)s were measured for the methyl protons of acetonitrile in benzene-d 6 at 20°C in the absence and presence of the silafluorene trimer, respectively. The significant change in T 1 values further supports a binding event between acetonitrile and the silafluorene trimer. These studies as well as significant changes and shifts observed in the characteristic UV-Vis absorption of the silafluorene group support an important role for the Lewis acid character of Si in polymer sensors that incorporate strained silacycles. The nitro groups of high explosives may act as weak Lewis-base donors to silacycles. This provides a donor-acceptor interaction that may be crucial for orienting the explosive analyte in the polymer film to provide an efficient pathway for inner-sphere electron transfer during the electron-transfer quenching process.","2-s2.0-68949200186"

Their thermal decomposition process and kinetic parameters from 323 to 673 K were investigated under a linear heating rate by DSC. The thermal decomposition of these salts undergoes an intensive exothermic decomposition stage to evolve abundant gas products and the enthalpies of exothermic decomposition reaction are high. The tests of sensitivity properties show these salts are insensitivity. All the properties of five nitrogen-rich salts appeared to depend on molecule structures and interconnection.

Isotopic composition of hexamine and RDX was analysed by stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Five different hexamine samples were selected from a group of eleven for use in this study. One of the five hexamine samples was used twice, providing data on the reproducibility of the synthesis.

Flexible on-site analysis may be facilitated by biosensor devices. With use of fibre-optic evanescent field techniques, it has been shown that immunoaffinity reactions can be used to determine explosives sensitively. Besides antibodies as molecular recognition elements, high-affinity nucleic acids (aptamers) can be employed. Aptamers are synthetically generated and highly efficient binding molecules that can be derived for any ligand, including small organic molecules like drugs, explosives or derivatives thereof. In this paper we describe the development of specific aptamers detecting the explosives molecule TNT. The aptamers are used as a sensitive capture molecule in a fibre-optic biosensor. In addition, through the biosensor measurements the aptamers could be characterised. The advantages of the aptamer biosensor include its robustness, its ability to discriminate between different explosives molecules while being insensitive to other chemical entities in natural soil and its potential to be incorporated into a portable device. Results can be obtained within minutes. The measurement is equally useful for soil that has been contaminated for a long time and for urgent hazardous spills. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-45849112144"

NI-DART generated ionization products similar to NI-APPI, which led to four ionization mechanisms, including electron capture (EC), dissociative EC, proton transfer, and anion attachment. These four ionization mechanisms make both NI-DART and NI-APPI capable of ionizing a wider range of compounds than negative ion-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or negative ion-electrospray ionization (ESI). As the operation of NI-DART is much easier than that of NI-APPI and the gas-phase ion chemistry of NI-DART is more easily manipulated than that of NI-APPI, NI-DART can be therefore used to study in detail the ionization mechanism of LC/NI-APPI-MS, which would be a powerful methodology for the quantification of low-polarity compounds. Herein, one such application has been further demonstrated in the detection and identification of background ions from LC solvents and APPI dopants, including water, acetonitrile, chloroform, methylene chloride, methanol, 2-propanol, hexanes, heptane, cyclohexane, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, toluene, and anisole. Possible reaction pathways leading to the formation of these background ions were further inferred. One of the conclusions from these experiments is that THF and 1,4-dioxane are inappropriate to be used as solvents and/or dopants for LC/NI-APPI-MS due to their high reactivity with source basic ions, leading to many reactant ions in the background. © 2009 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.","2-s2.0-57749185046"

The focus of the research was on ammonium nitrate (AN), a common oxidiser used in improvised explosive mixtures. The potential value of IRMS to attribute Australian AN samples to the manufacturing source was demonstrated through the development of a preliminary AN classification scheme based on nitrogen isotopes. Although the discrimination utilising nitrogen isotopes alone was limited and only relevant to samples from the three Australian manufacturers during the evaluated time period, the classification scheme has potential as an investigative aid. Combining oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope values permitted the differentiation of AN prills from three different Australian manufacturers. Samples from five different overseas sources could be differentiated utilising a combination of the nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen isotope values. Limited differentiation between Australian and overseas prills was achieved for the samples analysed. The comparison of nitrogen isotope values from intact AN prill samples with those from post-blast AN prill residues highlighted that the nitrogen isotopic composition of the prills was not maintained post-blast; hence, limiting the technique to analysis of un-reacted explosive material.

In the recent past SEM/EDX was used several times to analyze PER from pyrotechnic compositions. The results from these studies suggest that there might be a difference in morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues formed at different levels of confinement. Also because of general thermodynamic principles it is believed that at higher levels of confinement the final pressure and temperature during the explosion is probably (but not necessarily) higher, eventually resulting in smaller and more spherical particles and a more homogeneous elemental composition. If there is a relation between morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues and the level of confinement at which these are formed, it would be possible to draw conclusions about the conditions at which pyrotechnic residues were formed and the kind and construction of the device used. This may aid forensic scientists not only in the determination of the original explosive composition, but also of the explosive device. To perform controlled experiments with pyrotechnic charges at, at least, two pre-set levels of confinement a test vessel was built by TNO Defence, Security and Safety. For this study, three different flash powder compositions and black powder were selected. The generated residues were sampled on collecting plates and Nucleopore filters connected to a pump system in the immediate vicinity of the venting area for further analyses by SEM/EDX and XRD. From the results it follows that in the pressure range studied, the level of confinement seems to have a minor effect on the features of the generated residue particles. Because passive sampling by means of collector plates seemed doubtful and because the number of experiments had to be limited it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions. In addition to the level of confinement several other variables may affect size, shape and composition of pyrotechnic residues. More experiments and improved sampling methods are necessary to determine what variables have the most pronounced effect on shape size and composition of pyrotechnic residues. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The conventional GC-MS/MS method provided separation times in 10 min with detection limits between 0.8 and 280 pg on column. The fast GC method with dynamic collision-induced dissociation (DCID) offered a confirmatory method for the analysis of high explosives with separation times under 2.5 min and detection limits between 0.5 and 5 pg on column, without any hardware modifications to the instrument. The implementation of DCID in combination with three-times-faster mass scanning allows the acquisition of tandem mass spectra to at least 5 Hz (while averaging three scans per spectrum). Although detection limits for GC-NCI-MS/MS using conventional CID or DCID are not quite on par with LODs achieved by GC-ECD, the combination of NCI with DCID tandem MS leads to detection limits at least comparable, if not superior, to other mass spectrometric methods.

The static desorption was carried out in the desorption chamber of the SPME-HPLC interface in the presence of mobile phase ACN/methanol/water (30:35:35) and the subsequent chromatographic analysis at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/ min and detection at 230 nm. For this purpose, a C18, 5 μm RP analytical column was used as a separation medium in this method. Several parameters relating to SPME, e.g., adsorption/desorption time, concentration of salt, stirring rate, etc., were optimized. The method was linear over the range of 20-400 ng/mL for HMX and RDX standards in the presence of surfactant in aqueous phase, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R2) for HMX and RDX are 0.9998 and 0.9982, respectively. With SPME, the detection limits (S/N = 3) in ng/mL are 0.05 and 0.1 for HMX and RDX, respectively in the presence of the SDS surfactant. The developed method has been applied successfully to the analysis of real environmental samples like bore well water, river water, and ground alluvial soil. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Samples of plastic material were collected from five distinct regions of each radio and analysed by Infrared and Raman spectroscopy to identify the nature of the material. One radio of each pair was then subjected to detonation with a commercially available plastic explosive. The combination of radio and explosive was considered to be representative of the components of an IED. Following detonation, fragments were recovered and, where possible, identified as specific sampling points of the radio. A combination of δ2H and δ13C stable isotopic analysis of material from each of the five sampling points was found to provide a pattern which was characteristic of a given radio and provided a means to associate pairs of radios. When few fragments were recovered, no positive association could be made between the fragments and the paired, undamaged radio. This was attributed, in part, to manufacturing variation in the radios. However, when three or more post-blast fragments were recovered it was possible to associate these with the paired, undamaged radio with a high degree of certainty. © 2009 Forensic Science Society.","2-s2.0-67349200770"

Anion efficiency curves for 19 anions have been measured including a long-lived (metastable) non-dissociated parent anion which is formed at energies near 0 eV. Many of the dissociative electron attachment products observed at low energy arise from surprisingly complex reactions associated with multiple bond cleavages and structural and electronic rearrangement.

In the present study, the thermal stability of four nitrocellulose samples containing various amount of nitrate groups was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature ranges of 192-209 °C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that nitrate content of nitrocellulose could has affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decrease by increasing its nitrogen percent. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the compound was increased.

The PF process involves the release of NOx(x∈=∈1,2) moieties from explosive compounds such as TNT, RDX, and PETN through a stepwise excitation-dissociation process using a 193 nm ArF laser. The NOx(x∈=∈1,2) produced upon PF is subsequently detected by its CL reaction with basic luminol solution. The intensity of the CL signal was detected by a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube with high quantum efficiency and negligible dark current counts. The system was able to detect trace amounts of explosives in various forms in real time under ambient conditions. Detection limits of 3 ppbv for PETN, 2 ppbv for RDX, and 34 ppbv for TNT were obtained. It was also demonstrated that the presence of PETN residue within the range of 61 to 186 ng/cm2 can be detected at a given signal-to-background ratio of 10 using a few microjoules of laser energy. The technique also demonstrated its potential for the direct analysis of trace explosive in soil.

So, we design unconventional emulsion explosives, and synthesize zinc and lithium oxides by means of deflagration firstly. Also, microstructures and morphology of nanometer thin sheets in the deflagration soot of emulsion explosives are measured in our experiments; namely, we surveyed and analyzed products with the implement of XRD, TEM and FTIR. It is concluded that nanoparticles of lithium and zinc oxides can be synthesized through deflagration of the unconventional emulsion explosive. Main contents and research results are as follows: First, unconventional emulsion explosives for synthesis of zinc and lithium oxides are designed firstly, and we also discuss mechanics of deflagration.

This method demonstrates the possibility of improved timing resolution for the digital measurement of time of flight compared with digital replica-analogue time pick-off methods for signals sampled at relatively low rates. Three analogue timing methods have been replicated in the digital domain (leading-edge, crossover and constant-fraction timing) for pulse data sampled at 8 GSa s-1. Events arising from the 7Li(p, n)7Be reaction have been detected with an EJ-301 organic liquid scintillator and recorded with a fast digital sampling oscilloscope. Sample-interpolation timing was developed solely for the digital domain and thus performs more efficiently on digital signals compared with analogue time pick-off methods replicated digitally, especially for fast signals that are sampled at rates that current affordable and portable devices can achieve. Sample interpolation can be applied to any analogue timing method replicated digitally and thus also has the potential to exploit the generic capabilities of analogue techniques with the benefits of operating in the digital domain. A threshold in sampling rate with respect to the signal pulse width is observed beyond which further improvements in timing resolution are not attained.

Detecting higher vapor pressure impurity compounds found in TNT and possible tagging agents mandated to be added to plastic explosives (RDX and PETN) would allow for easier vapor detection. The higher vapor pressure nitro compounds of interest are considered to be non-fluorescent; however, once reduced to their amino analogs, they have relatively high quantum yields. The standard reduction products, the reduction products obtained in solution, and the reduction products obtained in vapor phase were analyzed by conventional fluorescence, synchronous luminescence, and derivative spectroscopy. The nitro analogs of the isomers 1,3-diaminobenzene, 1,2-diaminobenzene, and 1,4-diaminobenzene are found as impurities in TNT. We provide for the first time the synchronous luminescence derivative spectra of these isomers; including their individual spectra and a spectrum of an isomeric mixture of the three. Using the standard reduction products associated with these isomers and other aromatic amines, our data suggest that the vapors of two signature impurities, 1,3-dinitrobenzene and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), minor impurity compounds, and two possible tagging agents, 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT) and 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), can be detected and selectively identified using our fluorescence approach. To prove our methodology, we show that we were able to generate, collect, and reduce 2-NT, 4-NT, and 2,4-DNT vapors to their amino analogs. Using our fluorescence approach, these vapors could be detected and selectively identified both individually and in a mixture. Collectively, our data indicate that our method of detecting and identifying higher vapor pressure explosive-like compounds could potentially be used to detect and identify low vapor pressure explosives such as TNT, RDX, and PETN.

To assess if these poly-nitroaromatic compounds (P-NACs) are being degraded in the subsurface, tracer-based groundwater dating techniques combined with compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) were applied. The groundwater residence times were distinctly different in the two aerobic aquifers, as determined by the tritium (3H)-3He method. In the contaminated zones, the upper aquifer exhibited groundwater ages of 25 years, whereas the lower (presumably confined) aquifer contained hardly any tritium which indicates water ages >55 years. P-NACs-containing waste waters are known to have leaked into the upper, unconfined aquifer. However, P-NACs were present in both aquifers in high concentrations (up to 33 000 μg L-1 TNT), which implies a hydraulic connection, although tritium concentrations and chemical data suggest two separated aquifers. Based on the 3H-3He groundwater dating and the presence of very high P-NAC concentrations, the contamination of the lower aquifer must have happened during the early stage of the explosive production, i.e. >50 years ago. Despite this 'old' contamination, TNT and DNT have not been transformed until to date as is demonstrated by the negligible changes in their carbon isotopic signatures (δ13C). Thus, P-NACs are very recalcitrant to degradation at the investigated site. If the aquifers remain aerobic, TNT and DNT are expected to persist in the subsurface for many decades to centuries. The presented approach of assessing time scales of natural attenuation at the field scale by the combination of CSIA and 3H-3He water dating has the potential to be applied to any other groundwater contaminants, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, gasoline components, heterocyclic carbenes, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the optimal separation conditions obtained using a 15 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2) containing 20 mM SDS, and applying a separation voltage of 1500 V, the four nitrate ester explosives were separated within less than 3 min. The glassy-carbon amperometric detector (operated at -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) offers convenient cathodic detection down to the picogram level, with detection limits of 0.5 ppm and 0.3 ppm for PGDN and for NG, respectively, along with good repeatability (RSD of 1.8-2.3%; n = 6) and linearity (over the 10-60 ppm range).

Tensor Technology Inc. has recently developed a methodology that will detect explosive compounds with pulsed fast neutron transmission spectroscopy. In this scheme, tritium beams will be used to generate neutrons with a broad energy spectrum as governed by the T(t,2n)4He fission reaction that produces 09-MeV neutrons. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in collaboration with Tensor Technology Inc., has designed and fabricated a pulsed white-spectrum neutron source for this application. The specifications of the neutron source are demanding and stringent due to the requirements of high yield and fast pulsing neutron emission, and sealed tube, tritium operation. In a unique co-axial geometry, the ion source uses ten parallel rf induction antennas to externally couple power into a toroidal discharge chamber. There are 20 ion beam extraction slits and three concentric electrode rings to shape and accelerate the ion beam into a titanium cone target. Fast neutron pulses are created by using a set of parallel-plate deflectors switching between ± 750 V and deflecting the ion beams across a narrow slit. The generator is expected to achieve 5 ns neutron pulses at tritium ion beam energies between 80-120 kV.

The objective of this research was to investigate the application of light stable isotopes and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to solve complex forensic cases by providing a level of discrimination not achievable utilising traditional forensic techniques. Due to the current threat of organic peroxide explosives, such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP), research was undertaken to determine the potential of IRMS to differentiate samples of TATP that had been manufactured utilising different starting materials and/or manufacturing processes. In addition, due to the prevalence of pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN) in detonators, detonating cord, and boosters, the potential of the IRMS technique to differentiate PETN samples from different sources was also investigated. Carbon isotope values were measured in fourteen TATP samples, with three definite groups appearing in the initial sample set based on the carbon data alone. Four additional TATP samples (in a second set of samples) were distinguishable utilising the carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions individually, and also in combination with the oxygen isotope values. The 3D plot of the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen data demonstrated the clear discrimination of the four samples of TATP. The carbon and nitrogen isotope values measured from fifteen PETN samples, allowed samples from different sources to be readily discriminated. This paper demonstrates the successful application of IRMS to the analysis of explosives of forensic interest to assist in discriminating samples from different sources. This research represents a preliminary evaluation of the IRMS technique for the measurement of stable isotope values in TATP and PETN samples, and supports the dedication of resources for a full evaluation of this application in order to achieve Court reportable IRMS results.

The scanner operates using the principle of neutron induced return gamma-ray spectrometry. This system utilizes high purity germanium detectors, a neutron generator based on deuterium-tritium fusion and a unique neutron reflector and guide design. The neutron reflector amplifies the flux and alters the energy spectrum of neutrons produced by the generator. A depleted uranium reflector is shown to perform 7.3 times better than no reflector, and is found to perform 1.5 times better than a tungsten reflector using MCNP simulation. This improvement is due to neutron knockout and induced fission occurring in depleted uranium.

Once selected a performance evaluation of the material composite formulations energetic properties is required. Tailoring the composite materials for a particular ordnance application requires selecting reactants that seek an optimized combination of economic costs and performance properties (e.g., energy release, temperature, and gas generation). A successful energetic material evaluation must identify reactants offering a good fit with performance requirements and an overall materials selection strategy. To aid energetic material users in making complex reactant selection decisions we introduce a modeling approach that combines the concepts of thermodynamics, economic costs, and goal programming. This study is unique in its application of goal programming in exploring this type of decision situation. A case study is used to illustrate the modeling approach.

These materials are composed of the polymeric matrix, iron powder (ferromagnetic properties), UV light active dyestuff and various metal oxides in a various ratios. A suitable analytical method has to be used for an accurate characterization of these metal components in the particles in order to find the required information, i.e. to determine the place and the year of production and as the case may be, also the production batch of misused explosives. In this work, the method of microwave digestion and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F-AAS) was developed for an accurate determination of Zn, Mg, Cu and Pb in a few novel types of identification particles and applied to their characterization. When using specific sample treatment (digestion with a mixture of nitric acid with hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acid), the 3σ limits of detection (LODs) for the determination of Zn, Mg, Cu and Pb in 5 mg original samples were 1.9, 0.2, 1.3 and 2.4 mg g-1, respectively. The signal suppression due to the presence of HNO3 + HCl or HNO3 + HF was observed for Zn; therefore, the calibration solutions had to be prepared exactly with the same acids as those used for the sample mineralization. The determination of Mg, Cu and Pb was free of interferences; hence a simple calibration curve method could be adopted for attaining accurate results. The accuracy was checked by comparison of the results with those obtained by means of independent inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Good precision values, as relative standard deviation, in the range of 1-5% were obtained.

While chemical explosives detection in the baggage-scanning domain has a rich history that sheds light on potential solutions, air cargo differs in several important ways, and thus one cannot look to the present array of technologies. Some contemporary solutions, such as trace analysis, are not readily applied to cargo because of sampling challenges while the larger geometry of air cargo makes others less effective. This review article examines an array of interrogation techniques using photons and neutrons as incident particles. We first present a summary of the signatures and observables chemical explosives provide and review how they have been exploited in baggage scanning. Following this review is a description of the challenges posed by the air-cargo application space. After considering sources of photons and neutrons, we describe methods focused on transmission imaging, sub-surface examination, and elemental characterization. It is our goal to expand the understanding of each method's technical promise while largely deferring questions that revolve around footprint, safety, and conduct of operations.

On each crystalline surface, binding properties of different polymers with the same chain segment are different from each other, while those of the polymers in the same content decrease in the sequence of PVDF > F2311 > F2314 ≈ PCTFE. The mechanical properties of a dozen of model systems (elastic coefficients, various moduli, Cauchy pressure, and Poisson's ratio) have been obtained.

The 50% lethal dose concentration for rats (LD50) was used as the estimation of toxicity in vivo to develop 1D QSAR models on the framework of Simplex representation of molecular structure. The results of 1D QSAR analysis show that even the information about the composition of molecules provides the main trends of toxicity changes. The necessity of consideration of substituents' mutual impacts for the development of adequate QSAR models of nitroaromatics' toxicity was demonstrated. Statistic characteristics for all the developed partial least squares QSAR models, except the additive ones are quite satisfactory (R2 = 0.81-0.92; Q2 = 0.64-0.83; Rtest2 = 0.84 - 0.87). A successful performance of such models is due to their non-additivity i.e. possibility of taking into account the mutual influence of substituents in benzene ring which plays the governing role for toxicity change and could be mediated through the different C-H fragments of the ring. The correspondence between observed and predicted by these models toxicity values is good.

The Sn(C) composite was prepared from the precursor tetramethyl-tin Sn(CH3)4, and the product contained a core of submicron-sized tin particles uniformly enveloped with carbon shells. Cyclic voltammograms of Sn(C) electrodes in aqueous sodium chloride solutions containing TNT show three well-pronounced reduction waves in the potential range of -0.50 to -0.80 V (vs. an Ag/AgCl/Cl- reference electrode) that correspond to the multistep process of TNT reduction. Electrodes containing Sn(C) particles annealed at 800 °C under argon develop higher voltammetric currents of TNT reduction (comparing to the as-prepared tin-carbon material) due to stabilization of the carbon shell. It is suggested that the reduction of TNT on core-shell tin-carbon electrodes is an electrochemically irreversible process. A partial oxidation of the TNT reduction products occurred at around -0.20 V. The electrochemical response of TNT reduction shows that it is not controlled by the diffusion of the active species to/from the electrodes but rather by interfacial charge transfer and possible adsorption phenomena. The tin-carbon electrodes demonstrate significantly stable behavior for TNT reduction in NaCl solutions and provide sufficient reproducibility with no surface fouling through prolonged voltammetric cycling. It is presumed that tin nanoparticles, which constitute the core, are electrochemically inactive towards TNT reduction, but Sn or SnO2 formed on the electrodes during TNT reduction may participate in this reaction as catalysts or carbon-modifying agents. The nitro-groups of TNT can be reduced irreversibly (via two possible paths) by three six-electron transfers, to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene, as follows from mass-spectrometric studies.

Direct detection methods include high-energy excitation techniques such as gamma-ray and x-ray fluorescence, detection of decomposition products by fluorescence or chemiluminescence, and detection following reduction to amines or another reaction to produce fluorescent products from the explosive. Indirect detection methods utilize the interference caused by the presence of explosive compounds with traditional processes of fluorescence and fluorescence quenching. Indirect detection methods include quenching of solution-phase, immobilized, and solid-state fluorophores, displacement of fluorophores, fluorescence immunoassay, and reactions that produce fluorescent products other than the explosive. A comprehensive review of these methods is presented. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-49049107513"

The detector was developed for fast neutron resonance radiography, a method capable of detecting a broad range of conventional and improvised explosives. In this study we have analyzed in detail, using Monte-Carlo calculations and experimentally determined parameters, all the processes that influence the signal and noise in the TRION detector. In contrast to event-counting detectors where the signal-to-noise ratio is dependent only on the number of detected events (quantum noise), in an energy-integrating detector additional factors, such as the fluctuations in imparted energy, number of photoelectrons, system gain and other factors will contribute to the noise. The excess noise factor (over the quantum noise) due to these processes was 4.3, 2.7, 2.1, 1.9 and 1.9 for incident neutron energies of 2, 4, 7.5, 10 and 14 MeV, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetric results indicate an electrocatalytic (EC′) mechanism. Mass transport aided chronoamperometry at a carbon disk electrode (Estep = - 400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) gave a limit of detection of 30 μM (3Sb/m). Most interestingly, the hydrolysis of HMTD was found to be rapid under mild reaction conditions which was found to be complete, and nearly instantaneously when exposed to a 50/50 (v/v%) water/acetonitrile solution at pH 2.1. This is in contrast with previous investigations that require harsher conditions. Neutralization or further derivatization steps were not necessary as the FeII/IIIEDTA complex acted as an electron shuttle under these conditions. These results indicate a basis for a fast, one-step, and inexpensive detector for HMTD.

Here, we show that this challenge can be overcome by combining photothermal spectroscopy on a bimaterial microcantilever with the mass induced change in the cantilever's resonance frequency.

Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the conversion to delta-phase. Raman results show that the δ material remains δ for long periods when stored in a dessicator at room temperature (RT), converts to alpha when stored at RT and 20-40% relative humidity (RH) over a period of days, and reverts to beta over a period of days when stored at RT and 95-98% relative humidity (RH).

Modeling results show that the overall reaction process can be considered a two-stage process.

Nitrate esters, the peroxide explosive triacetone triperoxide, and the taggant 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-dinitrobutane were too strongly retained to elute from the La(dihed) column; however, these compounds could be eluted from the less retentive Cu(dihed) or Zn(dihed) columns. A Kováts index of 2124 for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) on the La(dihed) column compared to 1662 on the control illustrates the excellent discrimination against nonpolar hydrocarbons, the principal matrix interference expected in air samples.

This immunoassay takes advantage of magnetic bead-based platform for competitive displacement immunoreactions and separation, and use electroactive nanoparticles as labels for signal amplification. For this assay, anti-TNT-coated magnetic beads interacted with TNT analog-conjugated poly(guanine)-silica NPs and formed analog-anti-TNT immunocomplexes on magnetic beads. The immunocomplexes coated magnetic beads were exposed to TNT samples, which resulted in displacing the analog conjugated poly(guanine) silica NPs into solution by TNT. In contrast, there are no guanine residues releasing into the solution in the absence of TNT. The reaction solution was then separated from the magnetic beads and transferred to the electrode surface for electrochemical measurements of guanine oxidation with Ru(bpy)32+ as mediator. The sensitivity of this TNT assay was greatly enhanced through dual signal amplifications: (1) a large amount of guanine residues on silica nanoparticles are introduced into the test solution by displacement immunoreactions and (2) a Ru(bpy)32+-induced guanine catalytic oxidation further enhances the electrochemical signal. Some experimental parameters for the nanoparticle label-based electrochemical immunoassay were studied and the performance of this assay was evaluated. The method is found to be very sensitive and the detection limit of this assay is ∼0.1 ng mL-1 TNT. The electrochemical immunoassay based on the poly[guanine]-functionalized silica NP label offers a new approach for sensitive detection of explosives. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Neutrons have the required penetration, they interact with matter in a manner complementary to X-rays and they can be used to determine elemental composition. Compared to neutron interrogation techniques that measure secondary radiation (neutron or gamma-rays), neutron radiography systems are much more efficient and rapid and they are much more amenable to imaging. However, for neutron techniques to be successfully applied to cargo screening, they must demonstrate significant advantages over well-established X-ray techniques. This paper reviews recent developments and applications of fast neutron radiography for cargo inspection. These developments include a fast neutron and gamma-ray radiography system that utilizes a 14 MeV neutron generator as well as fast neutron resonance radiography systems that use variable energy quasi-monoenergetic neutrons and pulsed broad energy neutron beams. These systems will be discussed and compared with particular emphasis on user requirements, sources, detector systems, imaging ability and performance. Crown Copyright © 2007.","2-s2.0-34548224275"

We have demonstrated the detection and discrimination of the biological warfare agent surrogates Bacillus subtilis (BG) (2% false negatives, 0% false positives) and ovalbumin (0% false negatives, 1% false positives) at 20 meters using standoff laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (STLIBS) and linear correlation. Unknown interferent samples (not included in the model), samples on different substrates, and mixtures of BG and Arizona road dust have been classified with reasonable success using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A few of the samples tested such as the soot (not included in the model) and the 25% BG:75% dust mixture resulted in a significant number of false positives or false negatives, respectively. Our preliminary results indicate that while LIBS is able to discriminate biomaterials with similar elemental compositions at standoff distances based on differences in key intensity ratios, further work is needed to reduce the number of false positives/negatives by refining the PLS-DA model to include a sufficient range of material classes and carefully selecting a detection threshold. In addition, we have demonstrated that LIBS can distinguish five different organophosphate nerve agent simulants at 20 meters, despite their similar stoichiometric formulas.

Limits of detection are in the picogram range. DESI analyses were performed without sample preparation and carried out in the presence of common interfering chemical matrices, such as insect repellant, urine, and topical lotions. Spatial and depth profiling was investigated to examine the depth of penetration and lateral resolution.

The definition of the neutron path and the time-of-flight measurement allow positioning the source of the gamma ray inside the container, while the chemical composition of the target material is correlated with the energy spectrum of the coincident gamma rays. However, in case of dense cargo, neutron moderation and photon attenuation inside the container make difficult the reconstruction of the material composition from the measured gamma-ray energy spectrum.

A critical hotspot can be seen as one end of the temperature distribution produced in a heterogeneous material by a shock. Studying shock sensitivity in a granular explosive thus allows insight into the temperature distribution produced by a shock in a granular material. In the case of cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), a commonly used explosive, no consensus exists on the dominant features which promote critical hotspots. We present an investigation of the morphology and sensitivity of seven batches of RDX in two size classes and with a range of morphologies. Both the individual crystal morphology and the bulk granular morphology were studied and the features likely to interact with a shock in a granular material to form a critical hotspot are identified. We find that the internal void count does not correlate with the sensitivity of a granular bed and that crystals with defects can be insensitive in such a charge. Sensitivity in our tests was correlated with the presence of surface ""dimples"" for particles which are 10-30 μm in size.

The same reaction was used for the spectrophotometric assay of TNT in soil by CRREL (Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory of the U.S. Army) method, also known as Jenkins' method, but the color stability was too dependent on the solution composition and the water tolerance was low, necessitating complete drying of soil samples (which may cause partial analyte decomposition) prior to analysis. This study reports the development of a colorimetric method based on the solid phase extraction (SPE) of the Meisenheimer anion formed from TNT and aqueous NaOH into a strongly basic anion exchange resin Dowex 1-X8 (OH- form). The orange-red color that developed both in the solid resin and solution phases was persistent for at least 1 h. The resin was let to swell in alcohol, washed first with 1 M aqueous NaOH, and then with H2O before use. To 5 mL of 4-400 ppm TNT solutions in 1:1 (v/v) acetone-water, 0.5 mL of 5% NaOH was added, diluted to 50 mL with 1:1 acetone-water, and the resulting solutions (containing the orange-red Meisenheimer anion of TNT) were agitated at room temperature with 0.9 g resin for ≤50 min. TNT exhibited a reasonably constant distribution coefficient between the resin and aqueous phases. The absorbance of the filtered solutions was measured against a reagent blank at 500 nm. The TNT-loaded resins were regenerated with 1 M HCl containing sodium sulfite. The calibration line of filtrate absorbance versus analytical concentration was linear over two orders of magnitude between 0.4 and 40 ppm TNT in final solution. Unlike Jenkins' method, the method was tolerant to 100-fold (by mass) of common soil anions like sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. The basic advantages of the developed colorimetric method over the similar CRREL/Jenkins' method may be summarized as color stability, water and common ion tolerance, lowering of the LOD, and widening of the linear range. As opposed to Jenkins' method, the charge-transfer bands characteristic to colorimetric detection were not obscured by the presence of water. The method is suitable for on-site applications, because the color developed in heterogenous solution was stabilized, and the method can be easily practiced with a portable colorimeter to large numbers of samples. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Compared to other aspiration condenser IMS with identical ion carrier gas and drift gas, our design has separate gas flows. This allows fluidic focusing of the ion carrier gas by means of geometric constrains. Thus, ions are focused before separation, which results in improved separation power. Furthermore, humidity in the ion carrier gas does not effect peak position in the ion mobility spectrum when using dry drift gas.

The analytes are observed as the alkali metal ion complexes. Remarkably, collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the HMTD, TATP, and TrATrP complexes with Na+, K+, and Li+ occurs with retention of the metal, a process triggered by an unusual hemolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond, forming a distonic ion. This is followed by elimination of a fragment of 30 mass units, shown to be the expected neutral molecule, formaldehyde, in the case of HMTD, but shown by isotopic labeling experiments to be ethane in the cases of TATP and TrATrP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the suggested fragmentation mechanisms for the complexes. Binding energies of Na+ of 40.2 and 33.1 kcal/mol were calculated for TATP-Na+ and HMTD-Na+ complexes, suggesting a strong interaction between the peroxide groups and the sodium ion. Increased selectivity is obtained either by MS/MS or by doping the spray solvent with additives that produce the lithium and potassium complexes of TATP, HMTD, and TrATrP. Addition of dopants into the solvent spray increased the signal intensity by an order of magnitude. When pure alcohol or aqueous hydrogen peroxide was used as the spray solvent, the (HMTD + Na)+ complex was able to bind a molecule of alcohol (methanol or ethanol) or hydrogen peroxide, providing additional characteristic ions to increase the selectivity of analysis. DESI also allowed the rapid detection of peroxide explosives in complex matrixes such as diesel fuel and lubricants using single or multiple cation additives (Na+, K+, and Li+, and NH 4+) in the spray solvent Low-nanogram detection limits were achieved for HMTD, TrATrP, and TATP in these complex matrixes.

Dual-beam radiography is an important enhancement to conventional single-beam X-ray radiography systems in that it provides additional information on the composition of the object being imaged. By comparing the attenuations of transmitted dual high-energy beams, it is possible to build a 2D image, colour coded to indicate material. Only high-energy X-rays, gamma-rays and neutrons have the required penetration to screen cargo containers. This paper reviews recent developments and applications of dual-beam radiography for air cargo inspection. These developments include dual high-energy X-ray techniques as well as fast neutron and gamma-ray (or X-ray) radiography systems. High-energy X-ray systems have the advantage of generally better penetration than neutron systems, depending on the material being interrogated. However, neutron systems have the advantage of much better sensitivity to material composition compared to dual high-energy X-ray techniques. In particular, fast neutron radiography offers the potential to discriminate between various classes of organic material, unlike dual energy X-ray techniques that realistically only offer the ability to discriminate between organic and metal objects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous work at the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) demonstrated the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the detection of energetic materials. Our recent efforts have been focused on improving the sensitivity and selectivity of LIBS for residue explosives detection and on extending this work to the standoff detection of explosive residues. One difficulty with detecting energetic materials is that the contribution to the oxygen and nitrogen signals from air can impede the identification of the explosive material. Techniques for reducing the air entrainment into the plasma-such as using an argon buffer gas or a collinear double-pulse configuration-have been investigated for this application. In addition to the laboratory studies, ARL's new double-pulse standoff system (ST-LIBS) has recently been used to detect explosive residues at 20 m. The efficacy of chemometric techniques such as linear correlation, principal components analysis (PCA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for the identification of explosive residues is also discussed. We have shown that despite the typical characterization of LIBS as an elemental technique, the relative elemental intensities in the LIBS spectra are representative of the stoichiometry of the parent molecules and can be used to discriminate materials containing the same elements. Simultaneous biohazard and explosive residue discrimination at standoff distances has also been demonstrated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.","2-s2.0-38549180987"

The existing colorimetric method for cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) based on a Griess reaction suffers from the non-quantitative reduction to nitrite and from the unstable character of HNO2 in acidic medium. Thus we propose a novel spectrophotometric RDX assay in explosive mixtures and residues, based on (Zn + HCl) reduction of RDX in a microwave oven, followed by neutralization of the reduction products to ammonia and low molecular-weight amines, and Berthelot reaction of these amine-compounds with phenol and hypochlorite in alkaline medium to give an intensely blue indophenol dye absorbing at 631 nm. The molar absorptivity and limit of detection (LOD) for RDX were (1.08 ± 0.04) × 104 L mol-1 cm-1 and 0.18 mg L-1, respectively. Application of the method to synthetic mixture solutions of RDX and trinitrotoluene (TNT) at varying proportions showed that there was minimal interference from TNT (which could be compensated for by dicyclohexylamine colorimetry), since the Berthelot reaction was essentially non-responsive to m-substituted anilines derived from TNT upon (Zn + HCl) reduction. The proposed method was successfully applied to military-purpose explosive mixtures of (RDX + inert matter) such as Comp A5, Comp C4, and Hexal P30, and to (RDX + TNT) mixtures such as Comp B. The molar absorptivity of RDX was much higher than that of either ammonium or nitrate; RDX could be effectively separated from ammonium and nitrate in soil mixtures, based on solubility differences. The Berthelot method for RDX was statistically validated using Comp B mixtures against standard HPLC equipped with a Hypersil C-18 column with (40% MeOH-60% H2O) mobile phase, and against gas chromatography-thermal energy analysis (GC-TEA) system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Blast loadings on structures have typically been evaluated using empirical relationships. These relationships assume that there are no obstacles between the explosive device and the target. If a blast barrier is used to protect personnel or a structure behind it, the actual blast loading environment will be significantly reduced for some distance behind the barrier. This paper is concerned with an accurate prediction of the area of effectiveness behind the barrier using experimental data and a neural network-based model. To train and validate the neural network, a database is developed through a series of measurements of the blast environment behind the barrier. The principal parameters controlling the blast environment, such as wall height, distance behind the wall, height above ground, and standoff distance are used as the training input data. Peak overpressure and peak scaled impulse are used as the outputs in the neural network configuration. The trained and validated neural network is used to develop contour plots of overpressure and impulse adjustment factors to simplify the process of predicting the effectiveness of blast barriers. The developed model is also deployed in a stand-alone application that is used as a fast-running predictive tool for the blast overpressures and impulses behind the wall. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrogen peroxide is shown to decrease currents in cobalt phthalocyanine sensors while it increases currents in nickel, copper, and metal-free phthalocyanine sensors; oxidation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide via catalysis at the phthalocyanine surface are consistent with the pattern of sensor responses. This represents the first example of MPc vapor sensors being oxidized and reduced by the same analyte by varying the metal center. Consequently, differential analysis by redox contrast with catalytic amplification using a small array of sensors may be used to uniquely identify peroxide vapors.

Relative performances (RP) of the mixtures and their individual components, relative to TNT, were determined by means of ballistic mortar. The detonation energies, E0, and detonation velocities, D, were calculated for the mixtures studied by means of the thermodynamic code CHEETAH. Relationships have been found and are discussed between the RP and the E0 values related to unit volume of gaseous products of detonation of these mixtures. These relationships together with those between RP and oxygen balance values of the mixtures studied indicate different types of participation of AN and UN in the explosive decomposition of the respective mixtures. Dry TATP/UN mixtures exhibit lower RP than analogous mixtures TATP/AN containing up to 25% of water. Depending on the water content, the TATP/AN mixtures possess higher detonability values than the ANFO explosives. A semi-logarithmic relationship between the D values and oxygen coefficients has been derived for all the mixtures studied at the charge density of 1000 kg m-3. Among the mixtures studied, this relationship distinguishes several samples of the type of ""tertiary explosives"" as well as samples that approach ""high explosives"" in their performances and detonation velocities. © 2007.","2-s2.0-43049111073"

The ionic analytes used for identification of explosives in this study comprised 18 anions (acetate, benzoate, bromate, carbonate, chlorate, chloride, chlorite, chromate, cyanate, fluoride, formate, nitrate, nitrite, perchlorate, phosphate, sulfate, thiocyanate and thiosulfate) and 12 cations (ammonium, barium(II), calcium(II), chromium(III), ethylammonium, magnesium(II), manganese(II), methylammonium, potassium(I), sodium(I), strontium(II), and zinc(II)). Two IC separations are presented, using suppressed IC on a Dionex AS20 column with potassium hydroxide as eluent for anions, and non-suppressed IC for cations using a Dionex SCS 1 column with oxalic acid/acetonitrile as eluent. Conductivity detection was used in both cases. Detection limits for anions were in the range 2-27.4 ppb, and for cations were in the range 13-115 ppb. These methods allowed the explosive residue ions to be identified and separated from background ions likely to be present in the environment. Linearity (over a calibration range of 0.05-50 ppm) was evaluated for both methods, with r2 values ranging from 0.9889 to 1.000. Reproducibility over 10 consecutive injections of a 5 ppm standard ranged from 0.01 to 0.22% relative standard deviation (RSD) for retention time and 0.29 to 2.16%RSD for peak area. The anion and cation separations were performed simultaneously by using two Dionex ICS-2000 chromatographs served by a single autoinjector. The efficacy of the developed methods was demonstrated by analysis of residue samples taken from witness plates and soils collected following the controlled detonation of a series of different inorganic homemade explosives. The results obtained were also confirmed by parallel analysis of the same samples by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with excellent agreement being obtained.

A passively Q-switched Cr4+Nd3+:YAG microchip laser is amplified within an Yb fiber amplifier, thus generating high power laser pulses (pulse energy Ep = 0.8 mJ, wavelength λ = 1064 nm, repetition rate frep. = 5 kHz, pulse duration tp = 1.2 ns). A passive (LMA) optical fiber is spliced to the active fiber of an Yb fiber amplifier for direct guiding of high power laser pulses to the sensor tip. In front of the sensor a plasma is generated on the surface to be analyzed. The plasma emission is collected by a set of optical fibers also integrated into the sensor tip. The spectrally resolved LIBS spectra are processed by application of principal component analysis (PCA) and analyzed together with the time-resolved spectra with neural networks. Such procedure allows accurate analysis of samples by LIBS even for materials with similar atomic composition. The system has been tested successfully during field measurements at the German Armed Forces test facility at Oberjettenberg. The LIBS sensor is not restricted to anti-personnel mine detection but has also the potential to be suitable for analysis of bulk explosives and surface contaminations with explosives, e.g. for the detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It was also used in the first World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993. It is difficult to identify UN in postexplosion debris, because in the presence of water it readily decomposes to its original components, urea and nitric acid. A method for the recovery and detection of urea nitrate in traces is described. The residues are extracted with hot acetone, and the extract chromatographed on chromosorb G-HP. The eluent is analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). By applying this technique, we were able to identify urea nitrate in actual exhibits. It was found that UN can be also formed during the analytical procedure, by certain combinations of urea, nitrate ions, and a source of protons and, hence, the presence of the characteristic adduct ion does not necessarily indicate an ""authentic"" urea nitrate.

Our approach is to develop specific sensor coating materials based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Despite the known inhibition of radical polymerisations by nitro groups and the known shrinkage of the polymer lattice during/after drying we were able to synthesize particulate MIPs by suspension polymerisation as well as thin MIP coatings by direct surface polymerisation on quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). The best method to purify the porous beads was Soxhlet extraction followed by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SFE with sc-CO2) at mild conditions (150 bar, 50 °C). At least a removal of >99.7% of the template was achieved. Performance tests of TNT imprinted polymer beads showed that acrylamide (AA) and more pronounced also methacrylic acid (MAA) possessed an enhanced adsorption tendency for gaseous TNT. An adsorption of 2,4-DNT, dinitrotoluene, by these MIPs was not detected. Using 2,4-DNT as template and methacrylamide, MAAM, a positive imprint effect for gaseous 2,4-DNT was achieved with no measurable cross-sensitivity for 2,4,6-TNT. The thin MIP coatings directly synthesized on the QCMs showed thicknesses of 20 to up to 500 nm. Preliminary screening experiments were performed for five different monomers and three different solvents (acetonitrile, chloroform and dimethylformamide). Best adsorption properties for TNT vapour until now showed a PAA-MIP synthesized with chloroform. Direct measurements of the mass attachment, respectively frequency decrease of the coated QCMs during vapour treatment showed a TNT-uptake of about 150 pg per μg MIP per hour.

Calorimetric techniques have been largely overlooked in efforts to develop advanced chemical analysis technology, largely because of limitations associated with the physical size of the instruments and the relatively long timescales (>30 min) required to obtain a result. This miniaturized calorimeter circumvents these limitations, thereby creating a first-of-its-kind system allowing thermal analysis to be performed in a portable format that can be configured for use in a variety of field operations with a significantly reduced response time (∼2 min). Unlike current explosives detectors, this system is based on calorimetric techniques that are inherently capable of providing direct measurements of energy release potential and therefore do not depend on prior knowledge of familiar compounds. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In both cases, the preferred method of analysis uses scanning electron microscopy to locate suspect particles and then uses energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to characterize the particle's constituent chemical elements. There are relatively few times when standard micro-analytical chemistry performed on pyrotechnic residues may not provide sufficient information for forensic investigators. However, on those occasions, PRRP analysis provides a greatly improved ability to discriminate between materials of pyrotechnic origin and other unrelated substances also present. The greater specificity of PRRP analysis is the result of its analyzing a large number of individual micron-sized particles, rather than producing only a single integrated result such as produced using standard micro-analytical chemistry. For example, PRRP analyses are used to demonstrate its ability to successfully (1) discriminate between pyrotechnic residues and unrelated background contamination, (2) identify that two different pyrotechnic compositions had previously been exploded within the same device, and (3) establish the chronology of an incident involving two separate and closely occurring explosions.

DESI also allowed detection of explosives in complex matrixes, including lubricants, household cleaners, vinegar, and diesel fuel.

A C8- carbon cluster primary ion beam was used in a commercial SIMS instrument to analyze samples of high explosives dispersed as particles on silicon substrates. In comparison with monatomic primary ion bombardment, the carbon cluster primary ion beam was found to greatly enhance characteristic secondary ion signals from the explosive compounds while causing minimal beam-induced degradation. The resistance of these compounds to degradation under ion bombardment allows explosive particles to be analyzed under high primary ion dose bombardment (dynamic SIMS) conditions, facilitating the rapid acquisition of spatially resolved molecular information. The use of cluster SIMS combined with computer control of the sample stage position allows for the automated identification and counting of explosive particle distributions on silicon surfaces. This will be useful for characterizing the efficiency of transfer of particulates in trace explosive detection portal collectors and/or swipes utilized for ion mobility spectrometry applications.","2-s2.0-33745165604"

DART has been installed on a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) that provides improved selectivity and accurate elemental composition assignment through exact mass measurements. Although DART has been applied to the analysis of gases, liquids, and solids, a unique application is the direct detection of chemicals on surfaces without requiring sample preparation, such as wiping or solvent extraction. DART has demonstrated success in sampling hundreds of chemicals, including chemical agents and their signatures, pharmaceutics, metabolites, peptides and oligosaccharides, synthetic organics, organometallics, drugs of abuse, explosives, and toxic industrial chemicals. These species were detected on various surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, human skin, currency, airline boarding passes, business cards, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages, body fluids, horticultural leaves, cocktail glasses, and clothing. DART employs no radioactive components and is more versatile than devices using radioisotope-based ionization.

The thermal behavior of n-Al (nano grain size aluminum) and g-Al (general grain size aluminum i.e., 10 μm) heated in air was also investigated by thermogravimetry. The burning rates results indicate that the usage of bimodal aluminum distribution with the ratio around 4:1 of n-Al to g-Al or the addition of 2% nano nickel powders (n-Ni) will improve the burning behavior of the propellant, while the usage of grading aluminum powders with the ratio 1:1 of n-Al to g-Al will impair the combustion of the propellant.

However, accidents still occur and operating problems exist among the RDX manufacturing process. This study utilized inherent safety concepts and DSC thermal analysis to assess the incompatible reaction hazards of RDX during usage, handling, storage, transporting and manufacturing. This assessment includes thermal curve observations and kinetic evaluations. A decomposition mechanism of the incompatible reaction is proposed. Among all the contaminants evaluated in this study, the existence of ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, ferric chloride hexahydrate and nitric acid shifted the main endothermic and exothermic reactions of RDX. These contaminants further advanced the exothermic temperature onset average by about 53, 46 and 61°C, respectively. The summarized results suggest that ferric oxide, ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, ferric chloride hexahydrate, acetone solution and nitric acid can influence the reaction and thermokinetic properties of RDX.

Analysis by methane PICI and ammonia NICI gave detection limits in the low nanogram range. Analyses were carried out on (linear) quadrupole and ion trap instruments. Analysis of TATP by PICI using ammonia reagent gas is the preferred analytical method, producing low limits of detection as well as an abundant (greater than 60% of base peak) diagnostic adduct ion at mlz 240 corresponding to [TATP + NH 4]+. Isolation of the [TATP + NH4]+ ion with subsequent collision-induced dissociation (CID) produces extremely low abundance product ions at ml z values greater than 60, and the mlz 223 ion corresponding to [TATP + H]+ was not observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B88LYP/DVZP level indicate that dissociation of the complex to form NH4+ and TATP occurs at energies lower than peroxide bond dissociation, while protonation of TATP leads to cleavage of the ring structure. These results provide a method for pico-gram detection levels of TATP using commercial instrumentation commonly available in forensic laboratories.

The new method employs a commercially available pulsed-discharge electron capture detector (PDECD) coupled with a microbore capillary gas chromatography (GC) column in a standard GC oven to achieve on-column detection limits between 5 and 72 fg for the nine explosives studied. The PDECD has the benefit that it uses a pulsed plasma to generate the standing electron current instead of a radioactive source. The fast separation time limits on-column degradation of the thermally labile compounds and decreases the peak widths, which results in larger peak intensities and a concomitant improvement in detection limits.

It is widely employed in ports of entry and by the military as a particle detector for explosives and drugs of abuse. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is an effective extraction technique that has been successfully employed in the field for the pre-concentration of a variety of compounds. Many organic high explosives do not have a high enough vapor pressure for effective vapor sampling. However, these explosives and their commercial explosive mixtures have characteristic volatile components detectable in their headspace. In addition, taggants are added to explosives to aid in detection through headspace sampling. SPME can easily extract these compounds from the headspace for IMS vapor detection. An interface that couples SPME to IMS was constructed and evaluated for the detection of the following detection taggants: 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB).

The relative intensities of the adduct species were determined to compare the competitive formation of the selected high explosives and anions. The relative stability of the adduct species varies, yielding preferential formation of certain anionic adducts with different high explosives. To exploit this effect, an isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ESI-MS method was developed and used for the simultaneous analysis of high explosives using two different techniques for the addition of the anionic additives; pre- and post-column. The results show that the pre-column approach provides similar results with improved selectivity for specific explosives. By detecting characteristic adduct species for each explosive, this method provides a qualitative and quantitative approach for the analysis and identification of high explosives.

Present techniques for the characterization of emulsion explosives and their residues is generally based on the detection and identification of the oxidizer and the hydrocarbon components. Use of these components is problematic for residue identification because ammonium nitrate, waxes, and oils are relatively common in the urban environment and even their co-detection does not exclude them being sourced from materials other than explosives. The detection of the emulsifier component offers increased evidential value as certain emulsifiers used in explosive formulations are manufactured for that specific use, or have limited environmental distribution. In the current study liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was utilized for the characterization of two emulsifiers in common use; ethanolamine adducts of polyisobutylene succinic anhydride and sorbitol mono-oleate (SMO). The LC-MS technique enabled the detection of both emulsifiers in preblast samples; however, only SMO was detected in postblast residues.

Particles produced by crushing crystals of RDX and PETN were sized by using scanning electron microscopy, combined with image analysis, and polarized light microscopy was used for imaging and identifying explosive particles in fingerprint residues. Crystals of RDX and PETN fragment in a manner that concentrates mass in the largest particles of the population, which is common for a fragmentation process. Based on the fingerprints studied, the particle size to target for improving mass detection in fingerprint residues by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is ≥10 μm in diameter. Although particles smaller than 10 μm in diameter have a higher frequency, they constitute <20% of the total mass. Efforts to improve collection efficiency of explosives particles for detection by IMS, or other techniques, must take into consideration that the mass may be concentrated in a relatively few particles that may not be homogeneously distributed over the fingerprint area. These results are based on plastic-bonded explosives such as C-4 that contain relatively large crystals of explosive, where fragmentation is the main process leading to the presence of particles in the fingerprint residues.

The evaluation uses the BAM code of ICT to model bands of reaction products. The code calculates NIR/IR-spectra (1-10 μm) of non homogenous gas mixtures of H2O (with bands around 1.3, 1.8, 2.7 and 6.2 μm), CO2 (with bands near 2.7 and 4.3 μm), CO (4.65 μm), NO (5.3 μm) and HCl (3.5 μm) taking into consideration also emission of soot particles. It is based on the single line group model and makes also use of tabulated data of H2O and CO2. Rotationally resolved emission spectra of diatomic flame radicals in UV/Vis-range like OH, CH, C2, NH correlate directly to the energies regarding electronic, vibrational and rotational energy transitions and therefore enable the estimation of flame temperatures. Taking into account that there are many unknown parameters influencing the emission spectrum of an inhomogenous gas mixture, only a simplified model can be applied. Therefore, it was assumed that the flame consists only of one hot emitting layer of undefined thickness, constant temperature, constant concentration of the various gases and soot particles in thermal equilibrium. These assumptions lead to a reasonable number of parameters, which can be determined by a least squares fit procedure fitting calculated spectra to experimental data. With this restriction, temperature and concentration * length of major combustion products can be determined. Additionally, it is found that many pyrotechnic reactions emit a nearly grey continuum in the NIR spectral range that can be used for temperature determination.

It was instructive to evaluate the composition of individual unfired gunpowder and OGSR particles. We determined that both the numerical centroid and dispersity of the P/S measurements provide information for associations and exclusions. Associating measurements from residue particles with those of residue samples collected from a test firing of the same weapon and ammunition appears to be a useful approach to account for any changes in composition that occur during the firing process.","2-s2.0-0036194704"

The low detection limits are provided by the efficient ionization process, namely, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) reactions in negative polarity. An additional level of confidence in a measurement is imparted by characterization of ions for mobilities in weak electric fields Of a drift tube at ambient pressure. Findings from over 30 years of investigations into IMS response to these explosives have been collected and assessed to allow a comprehensive view of the APCI reactions characteristic of nitro-organic explosives. Also, the drift tube conditions needed to obtain particular mobility spectra have been summarized. During the past decade, improvements have occurred in IMS on the understanding of reagent gas chemistries, the influence of temperature on ion stability, and sampling methods. In addition, commercial instruments have been refined to provide fast and reliable measurements for on-site detection of explosives. The gas phase ion chemistry of most explosives is mediated by the fragile C-ONO2 bonds or the acidity of protons. Thus, M- or M·Cl- species are found with only a few explosives and loss of NO2, NO3 and proton abstraction reactions are common and complicating pathways. However, once ions are formed, they appear to have stabilities on time scales equal to or longer than ion drift times from 5-20 ms.
