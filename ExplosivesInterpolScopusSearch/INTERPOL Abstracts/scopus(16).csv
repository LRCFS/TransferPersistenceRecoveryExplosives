Except for the Mg2+⋯π system with (E)-O2N-CH = CH-NO 2 (i.e., C2H2N2O4⋯ Mg2+), the strength of the trigger-bond X-NO2 (X = C, N or O) was enhanced upon complex formation. Furthermore, the increment of bond dissociation energy of the X-NO2 bond in the Na+ complex was far greater than that in the corresponding HF system. Thus, the explosive sensitivity in the former might be lower than that in the latter. For C 2H2N2O4⋯Mg2+, the explosive sensitivity might also be reduced. Therefore, it is possible that introducing cations into the structure of explosives might be more efficacious at reducing explosive sensitivity than the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen-bonded complex. AIM, NBO and electron density shifts analyses showed that the electron density shifted toward the X-NO2 bond upon complex formation, leading to a strengthened X-NO2 bond and possibly reduced explosive sensitivity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-84878760930"

The ability to control compositions and properties for such materials is also of interest since it can lead to optimal performance, controlled energy release, and low sensitivity. With these goals in mind, we focus our work on a high energy density material, 1,1-diamino-2,2- dinitroethylene (FOX-7). FOX-7 nanocrystals under confined conditions are synthesized in mesoporous carbon FDU-15 through self-assembly. Complete impregnation can be achieved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at 100-110 °C, and the maximum amount of FOX-7 in the FOX-7/FDU-15 composites is around 43.8 wt.% (C-43.8). Host-guest interactions are investigated by wide-angle XRD, 13C solid-state NMR, and FT-IR. C-43.8 shows low phase transition temperature and fast thermal decomposition rate compared with bulk FOX-7 crystals and the physical mixture. The host-guest structure of the composites demonstrates a novel and efficient space-insensitivity concept. C-43.8 shows no sensitivity toward both friction and impact, and insensitive to electrostatic spark (V50 > 37 kV; E50 > 20 J). The extreme insensitivity is closely related to the high thermal and mechanical stability of FDU-15. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84871819454"

TiO2-(B) in the form of nanowires has been demonstrated to be a promising material for the detection of explosive gases such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). However, the elimination of cross-sensitivity of the explosive detectors based on TiO2-(B) toward environmental humidity is still a major challenge. It was found that the cross-sensitivity could be effectively modulated when the thin film of TiO 2-(B) nanowires was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light during the detection of explosives under operating conditions. Such a modulation of sensing responses of TiO2-(B) nanowires to explosives by UV light was attributed to a photocatalytic effect, with which the water adsorbed on the TiO2-(B) nanowire surface was split and therefore the sensor response performance was less affected. It was revealed that the cross-sensitivity could be suppressed up to 51% when exposed to UV light of 365 nm wavelength with an intensity of 40 mW cm-2. This finding proves that the reduction of cross-sensitivity to humidity through UV irradiation is an effective approach that can improve the performance of a sensor based on TiO2-(B) nanowires for the detection of explosive gas. © 2013 The Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-84876589032"

The results of ANOVA showed that 3.5 mol/l HMX concentration, 3 ml/min solution flow rate, cyclohexanone as solvent, and 70 ml/min flow rate of CO2 are optimum conditions for producing HMX nanoparticles.

This paper reports a new microcalorimeter for detection of trace explosives with low detection limit and fast detection rate. The microcalorimeter consists of a suspended micromembrane with integrated heaters and thermistors and a carbon nanotube (CNT) interface layer in-situ synthesized on the membrane surface. Due to the large surface areas, the CNT interface layer improves adsorption to target chemical molecules. By operating the microcalorimeter in differential scanning calorimetry mode and differential thermal analysis mode, trace chemical detection is achieved through heating the adsorbed chemicals to deflagration and measuring the induced thermal response features and the total heat. The microcalorimeter is verified by explosive detection, and an equivalent limit of detection of 2.6 pg has been achieved by extrapolating the measurement results. Theoretically, detection is distinguishable upon 10-s fast exposure to saturated explosive vapors. These preliminary results demonstrate the ability of the microcalorimeter in detection of trace energetic chemicals. [2012-0007] © 2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84873319383"

The aim of this study was to analyze the thermal hazard of various fire-extinguishing reagents mixed with TATP. Various functions of fire-extinguishing reagents may have different extent of reactions with TATP. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) were used to detect the thermal hazard and to evaluate the effect of fire-extinguishing reagents mixed with TATP under fire condition. TATP decomposed rapidly and final decomposition was calculated before 200 C. Therefore, heat of decomposition (ΔH d) of TATP was evaluated to be 2,500 J g-1 by DSC under 2 C min-1 of heating rate. H2O2, acetone, and H2SO 4 should not be mixed in a wastewater drum. TATP decomposed at 50 C by DSC using O2 of reaction gas that is an exothermic reaction and can decompose a large amount of heat. Therefore, TATP was applied to assess thermal pyrolysis by DSC employing N2 of reaction gas that can analyze an endothermic reaction. Mass loss percentage of TATP was evaluated to be 100 % when the ambient temperature exceeds 110 C by TG using O2 or N2 of reaction gas. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-84880508826"

Liquid explosives are highly concentrated emulsions by their physical nature. During the internal phase, it is an aqueous supersaturated solution of mainly ammonium nitrate which is a useful component of a multi-component system, and at the continuous phase it is a solution of emulsifier in hydrocarbon oils. Liquid explosives demonstrate a complex set of properties characteristic for highly concentrated emulsions, such as visco-plasticity, existence of the yield stress, thixotropy (or time-dependent behavior), non-Newtonian flow at stresses exceeding the yield stress. Rheological properties depend on the concentration of internal phase, size of droplets, and the nature of the used surfactant. Stability of these materials is determined mainly by the tendency of an aqueous solution to crystallization at prolonged storage, though shearing does not influence on phase separation. Wall slip is absent in flow of liquid emulsions through tubes. Therefore, it allows us to make reliable predictions on the output vs. pressure dependence for real technological practice. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","2-s2.0-84872820550"

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques have been used to study thermal behavior of these energetic compounds. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the KNF occurs during two temperature ranges of 270-330 and 360-430 °C. Meanwhile, NTO decomposes completely in temperature range of 250-300 °C. TG-DTA analysis of KNF indicates that this energetic compound dehydrated (at about 108 °C) before its decomposition.

Today, the huge arsenal of micro-sensors has revolutionized the traditional methods of analysis by, e.g. replacing expensive laboratory equipment, and has made the remote screening of atmospheric threats possible. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors - based on piezoelectric crystal resonators - are extremely sensitive to even very small perturbations in the external atmosphere, because the energy associated with the acoustic waves is confined to the crystal surface. Combined with suitably designed molecular recognition materials SAW devices could develop into highly selective and fast responsive miniaturized sensors, which are capable of continuously monitoring a specific organic gas, preferably in the sub-ppm regime. For this purpose, different types of recognition layers ranging from nanostructured metal oxides and carbons to pristine or molecularly imprinted polymers and self-assembled monolayers have been applied in the past decade.

Because of their small size, hot-spots are difficult to experimentally interrogate, particularly for high volumetric strain rates (ε V > 10, 000 s - 1). In this study, simulations are performed for large ensembles of deformable particles (≈ 4000 particles) using a combined finite and discrete element technique to characterize statistical distributions of hot-spot intensity, geometry, and spatial proximity within and behind quasi-steady, piston supported uniaxial waves in granular HMX (C 4 H 8 N 8 O 8). Emphasis is placed on examining how the material's initial particle packing density, characterized by its effective solid volume fraction φ s, 0, affects hot-spot statistics for pressure dominated waves corresponding to piston speeds within the range 300 ≤ U p ≤ 500 m / s. Predictions indicate that hot-spot intensity is only marginally affected by initial porosity (1 - φ s, 0) for all piston speeds, whereas hot-spot size, number density, volume fraction, and volume specific surface area appreciably increase with porosity and exponentially increase with piston speed. Minor variations in particle shape are predicted to be largely inconsequential. Joint distributions of hot-spot intensity and size are combined with thermal explosion data to identify and examine critical hot-spots that quickly react behind waves. These results indicate that the observed increase in sensitivity with initial porosity for sustained loading is likely due to an increase in hot-spot size and number rather than intensity. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","2-s2.0-84878408363"

Therefore, all aspects that had an influence on the formation of such an atmosphere had to be considered. The most important influencing factors were permeation, air change in the freight container and ambient temperature. The first step was to investigate the permeation with different packaging materials, charge and temperatures. Furthermore, the air change rates of different freight containers were measured. A few climate tests with containers on ships, e.g. to Singapore, were performed to assess normal conditions of carriage. Another important point was measuring the solvent (toluene) concentration in the gas phase in a freight container loaded with plastic intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) filled with toluene. To confirm that the measured values were in the right range, the toluene concentration in the gas phase in a container was calculated with different packaging materials, air change rates and temperatures. The results of the measurements and calculations have shown that safety layers in the packaging wall, e.g. the copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and polyamide, can reduce the rate of permeation by more than a decimal power, but the lower explosive limit of toluene is easily reached within a few hours at 40°C charge temperature if there is no barrier.

Hydrogen bonds are speculated to be the main driving force. Complete impregnation can be achieved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at 100-110 °C, which optimizes the interaction of organic molecule with matrix, and the maximum loading amount is around 42.8 wt.%. Structural characterization is provided by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, N 2 sorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The formation of a new metastable phase of PA is supported by wide-angle XRD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, and it is believed that this phase can only be stable in confined conditions.

Failure of PBX caused by mechanical damage is one of the sources of accidental ignitions. A brittle crack of PBX produces local heating, creating a 'hot spot' finally. Investigation into the tensile fracture behaviour of PBX is one of the main works to determine the failure mechanism. Although many researchers have carried out the quasi-static Brazilian test to understand the damage evolution of PBX, the fracture feature of PBX under dynamic impact is rarely reported. In this article, dynamic Brazilian tests were conducted. A single-pulse loading apparatus was used to ensure that specimen was loaded only once during a dynamic Brazilian test. High-speed camera, digital image correlation and micro-observation techniques were adopted for strain measurement and microfracture observation. All the dynamic tensile crack exhibits transgranular fracture, which indicates more heat would released by the propagation of crack and more friction between fractured crystal surfaces. On the basis of the theories of interface debonding and transgranular fracture, larger crystals are more prone to crack, whereas smaller crystals simply debond with neighbouring binders. Discrete element method simulation results show that specimen with interface debonding microcracks was able to sustain additional load until transgranular fracture begins. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-84869488664"

The in situ synthesis achieves minimized thermal resistance of the interface between the CNTs and the microcantilever, which together with the low thermal mass and the high thermal conductivity allows the sensor to operate in microcalorimeter mode. By heating the CNT networks with an integrated heater, the explosive vapors adsorbed on the CNT surfaces are ignited to deflagration, which releases extra heat to deflect the microcantilever and thus changes the resistance of an integrated piezoresistor. This thermal-mechanical coupling transduction mechanism bridges the heat changes on the CNT networks and the mechanical deflection of the microcantilever. The large surface to volume ratio of CNTs enables fast adsorption of the chemical sensor to explosive vapors and improved equivalent limit of detection (LOD). An equivalent LOD of 2.4 pg is achieved for TNT detection, and run-to-run repeatability and device-to-device reproducibility are better than 4% and 10%.

The FEL provides support and advice to the Home Office and UK police forces on matters relating to the criminal misuse of explosives. During 1989 the FEL established a weekly quality assurance testing regime in its explosives trace analysis laboratory. The purpose of the regime is to prevent the accumulation of explosives traces within the laboratory at levels that could, if other precautions failed, result in the contamination of samples and controls. Designated areas within the laboratory are swabbed using cotton wool swabs moistened with ethanol:water mixture, in equal amounts. The swabs are then extracted, cleaned up and analysed using Gas Chromatography with Thermal Energy Analyser detectors or Liquid Chromatography with triple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry. This paper follows on from two previous published papers which described the regime and summarised results from approximately 14. years of tests. This paper presents results from the subsequent 7. years setting them within the context of previous results. It also discusses further improvements made to the systems and procedures and the inclusion of quality assurance sampling for the peroxide explosives TATP and HMTD. Monitoring samples taken from surfaces within the trace laboratories and trace vehicle examination bay have, with few exceptions, revealed only low levels of contamination, predominantly of RDX. Analysis of the control swabs, processed alongside the monitoring swabs, has demonstrated that in this environment the risk of forensic sample contamination, assuming all the relevant anti-contamination procedures have been followed, is so small that it is considered to be negligible. The monitoring regime has also been valuable in assessing the process of continuous improvement, allowing sources of contamination transfer into the trace areas to be identified and eliminated. © 2012.","2-s2.0-84867649467"

The counterpoise-corrected ion-pair binding energies were calculated for each ion pair at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. Results show that the cation-anion interaction is strongest for ion pair I and weakest for IV, indicating that the nitrate (I) has a greater tendency to exist as a stable ionic salt whereas the 3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazolate (IV) may exist as an ionic liquid. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and electrostatic potential (ESP) mapping revealed that charge transfer occurs in all of the ion pairs, but is greatest (0.25e) for ion pair I and smallest (0.03e) for IV, resulting in ion pair I being the least polarized. A nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) study revealed that the aromaticity of the 1-butyl-2,4-dinitro-3-methyl imidazolium ion significantly increases in ion pair IV, indicating that this has the greatest charge delocalization among all of the four ion pairs considered. Studies of thermodynamic and detonation properties showed that ion pair II is the most energetic ion pair in terms of its detonation velocity (D = 7.5 km s-1) and detonation pressure (P = 23.1 GPa). It is also envisaged that ion pair IV would exist as an energetic azolium azolate type ionic liquid that could be conveniently used as a secondary explosive characterized by detonation parameters D and P of 6.9 km s-1 and 19.3 GPa, respectively.

It was found that the thermal decomposition of α-CL-20, ε-CL-20/C4, and RS-ε-CL-20/C4 could be considered as a two-step process and the initial step is partly controlled by crystal structure. However, the crystal structure could only affect the initial step of decomposition and the total heat release, and the heat release of RS-ε-CL-20 is the highest compared with α- and normal ε-CL-20. In addition, the activation energy of studied materials was calculated by Kissinger method and modified KAS method, which was compared with the results obtained by other researchers. It was indicated that the obtained activation energy of ε-CL-20 by Kissinger method is about 176.0 kJ mol-1, which is almost the same with the results from the literatures by STABIL and Noniso-TG methods. It was noticed that the crystal structure has significant effect on the initial activation energy distribution of CL-20, while in case of second stage (α = 0.30-0.85) this effect is relatively small, resulting in identical decomposition mechanism. Moreover, the kinetic compensation effects show that the studied materials could be divided into two groups, one including ε-CL-20, RS-ε-CL-20, α-CL-20, and ε-CL-20/C4 which decompose at solid state and another including ε-CL-20/Formex and RS-ε-CL-20/C4 which decompose at partial liquid state, resulting in different kinetic compensation effects.

A shock initiation model of homogeneous explosives was established in the early 1960s. It involves a thermal explosion event at the shock entrance boundary, which develops into a superdetonation that overtakes the initial shock. In recent years, Sheffield and his group, using accurate experimental tools, were able to observe details of buildup of the superdetonation. There are many papers on modeling shock initiation of heterogeneous explosives, but there are only a few papers on modeling shock initiation of homogeneous explosives. In this article, bulk reaction reactive flow equations are used to model homogeneous shock initiation in an attempt to reproduce experimental data of Sheffield and his group. It was possible to reproduce the main features of the shock initiation process, including thermal explosion, superdetonation, input shock overtake, overdriven detonation after overtake, and the beginning of decay toward Chapman-Jouget (CJ) detonation.

A two-step mechanism has been found for thermal decomposition of α-CL-20, ε-CL-20/C4, and RS-ε-CL-20/C4, where the initial step is partly controlled by crystal structure of CL-20. The more reasonable mean activation energies could be obtained after peak separation for each individual steps. In fact, the activation energy for the post integrated process is almost equivalent with that of the second step, indicating that the total activation energy at the main decomposition process is dominated by thermolysis of CL-20 molecular. Besides, it has been found that the decomposition of C4 matrix does not affect the decomposition of normal ε-CL-20, resulting in identical activation energy and reaction model. However, the interaction between the C4 matrix and RS-ε-CL-20 is significant especially at the initial stage, where the activation energy of RS-ε-CL-20/C4 was overestimated before peak separation, while the activation energy for the second step due to thermolysis of CL-20 molecular is underestimated. The first decomposition step for α-CL-20, ε-CL-20/C4, and RS-ε-CL-20/C4 could be considered as autocatalytic process (AC model), whereas the second as JMA model, which is also applicable to that of pure ε-CL-20 and RS-ε-CL-20.

Covalently bonding of porphyrin fluorophores into the polyimide main chains reduces the aggregation-caused fluorescence self-quenching of porphyrin and improves the physicochemical stability of the polyimide nanofibers. The large surface area-to-volume ratio and hence good gas accessibility endow the porphyrinated nanofibers with much more remarkable fluorescent quenching behavior toward trace TNT vapor than its spin-coating dense film counterparter. Besides TNT, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA) and nitrobenzene (NB) could also quench the fluorescence of the porphyrinated nanofibers, but the quenching efficiency is much lower than that of TNT.

As is well-known, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) is a high energy density material (HEDM). But the application of HMX is limited, due to its high sensitivity. Thus, an insensitive explosive 5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (NTO) is proposed as a cocrystal former (CCF) to cocrystallize with HMX in the present work. The binding energies, heat of formations (HOFs), thermodynamic properties, atoms in molecules, and natural bond orbital analysis of four HMX/NTO complexes have been calculated using density functional theory methods, including meta-hybrid functional (M062X) and dispersion-corrected density functionals (B97D, ωB97XD). In addition, the crystal structure of HMX/NTO cocrystal has been investigated using Monte Carlo simulation and first principles methods. The HMX/NTO cocrystal is most likely to crystallize in triclinic crystal system with P1 space group, and corresponding cell parameters are Z = 2, a = 9.06 Å, b = 8.19 Å, c = 10.27 Å, α = 81.94°, β = 98.42°, γ = 82.03°, and ρ = 1.92 g/cm3. The detonation velocity and detonation pressure of HMX/NTO cocrystal are 8.73 km/s and 35.14 GPa, respectively, a little lower than those of HMX. Finally, bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the weakest trigger bond in HMX/NTO complexes are calculated. The results show that HMX/NTO complexes are thermally stable and meet the thermal requirement of HEDMs (BDE > 120 kJ/mol). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2-s2.0-84875824529"

The degradation products observed in post-explosion samples were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as the less-nitrated analogues of PETN: pentaerythritol trinitrate (PETriN), pentaerythritol dinitrate (PEDiN) and pentaerythritol mononitrate (PEMN). Significant levels of these degradation products were observed in post-explosion samples, whereas only very low levels were detected in a variety of intact PETN samples and naturally degraded PETN. No significant degradation was observed after 12 weeks of storage at room temperature and the influence of high relative humidity (90%) was found to be small. Natural degradation was accelerated by storage of small amounts of PETN on different types of textile, resembling the clothing of a suspect, at elevated temperature (333. K). This resulted in significant levels of PETN degradation products, but the relative amounts remained much lower than in post-explosion PETN. For PETriN the peak area relative to PETN was 0.014 (SD=0.0051) and 0.39 (SD=0.19) respectively. Based on the peak areas of PETriN, PEDiN and PEMN relative to PETN, it was possible to fully distinguish the post-explosion profiles from the profiles obtained from intact PETN or after (accelerated) natural degradation.Although more data are required to accurately assess the strength of the evidence, this work illustrates that PETN profiling may yield valuable evidence when investigating a possible link between a suspect and post-explosion PETN found on a crime scene. Due to the substantial variation in the degradation pattern between explosion experiments and even between sampling positions in one experiment, the method is not able to distinguish different PETN explosion events. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84879601563"

Here, we discuss the use of these methods for characterizing nanothermites, energetic compositions made of metallic oxides and a fuel (often a reducing metal). The experimental limitations of these analysis techniques are identified. It is difficult to ignite nanothermites with slow heating rates as those used in DSC. This is due to the inorganic nature of the thermite components and because the reaction involves interparticular heat and matter transfers. In addition, during the progressive decomposition of nanothermites, there is no change in mass, so it cannot be observed by thermogravimetric analysis. The use of laser ignition to prime the abrupt combustion of nanothermite pellets allows determining the ignition energy and analyzing the propagation of the combustion front. It also provides qualitative data that can be used to understand the combustion mechanism and to correlate it to the microstructure of the nanothermites.

This manuscript presents a simple, all-solid-state, wearable fingertip sensor for the rapid on-site voltammetric screening of GSR and explosive surface residues. To fabricate the new Forensic Fingers, we screen-print a three-electrode setup onto a nitrile finger cot, and coat another finger cot with an ionogel electrolyte layer. The new integrated sampling/detection methodology relies on 'voltammetry of microparticles' (VMP) and involves an initial mechanical transfer of trace amounts of surface-confined analytes directly onto the fingertip-based electrode contingent. Voltammetric measurements of the sample residues are carried out upon bringing the working electrode (printed on the index finger cot) in direct contact with a second finger cot coated with an ionogel electrolyte (worn on the thumb), thus completing the solid-state electrochemical cell. Sampling and screening are performed in less than four minutes and generate distinct voltammetric fingerprints which are specific to both GSR and explosives. The use of the solid, flexible ionogel electrolyte eliminates any liquid handling which can resolve problems associated with leakage, portability and contamination. A detailed study reveals that the fingertip detection system can rapidly identify residues of GSR and nitroaromatic compounds with high specificity, without compromising its attractive behavior even after undergoing repeated mechanical stress.

The steady-state thermal response of the samples was measured at discrete excitation frequencies via infrared thermography. A maximum temperature rise of approximately 15 K was observed in PBX 9501, and the mock materials exhibited similar thermal characteristics. Temperature gradients were calculated to estimate the total heat generated within the samples due to the mechanical excitation. The active heating mechanisms were found to be highly dependent on the frequency of excitation. Possible mechanisms of heating at frequencies below 1 MHz are likely related to bulk motion. Above this frequency, the active heating mechanisms are likely related to particle-scale processes. The observed phenomena may prove useful in the aid of current trace vapor detection methods for explosives. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-84874880200"

One of the characteristics needed for solid propellants is stability. Heat, light, and moisture are factors affecting stability during storage, manufacture, and use. For practical use of ADN as a solid propellant, clarification of the mechanism of decomposition by these factors is needed to be able to predict lifetime. This study focused on thermal decomposition of ADN. Exothermal behavior of ADN decomposition was measured by isothermal tests using high-sensitive calorimetry (TAM) and non-isothermal tests using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Based on these results, analysis of the decomposition kinetics was conducted. The activation energy determined by TAM tests was lower than that from DSC tests. Thus, the decomposition path in TAM tests was different from that in DSC tests. The amount of ADN decomposition predicted from TAM tests was closer to that found under real storage conditions than the amount of decomposition predicted from DSC tests. Non-isothermal tests may not be able to precisely predict the lifetime of materials with a decomposition mechanism that changes with temperature, such as ADN. The lifetime predicted from DSC results was much longer than that from TAM tests especially at low temperature. It is necessary to use isothermal tests to predict the long-term stability at low temperature. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-84872486851"

HTC of nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing materials produces unintended byproduct gases that could affect isotope analyses by: (1) allowing isotope exchange reactions downstream of the HTC reactor, (2) creating isobaric or co-elution interferences, and (3) causing deterioration of the chromatography. This study characterizes these HTC byproducts. METHODS A HTC system (ThermoFinnigan TC/EA) was directly connected to a gas chromatograph/quadrupole mass spectrometer in scan mode (m/z 8 to 88) to identify the volatile products generated by HTC at conversion temperatures of 1350 °C and 1450°C for a range of nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing solids [keratin powder, horse hair, caffeine, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, urea, and three nitrated organic explosives (PETN, RDX, and TNT)]. RESULTS The prominent HTC byproduct gases include carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane, acetylene, and water for all nitrogen-bearing compounds, as well as carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide for sulfur-bearing compounds. The 1450°C reactor temperature reduced the abundance of most byproduct gases, but increased the significant byproduct, hydrogen cyanide. Inclusion of a post-reactor chemical trap containing Ascarite II and Sicapent, in series, eliminated the majority of byproducts. CONCLUSIONS This study identified numerous gaseous HTC byproducts. The potential adverse effects of these gases on isotope ratio analyses are unknown but may be mitigated by higher HTC reactor temperatures and purifying the products with a purge-and-trap system or with chemical traps.

Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) is a nitramine compound that is well known as an energetic material. The burning characteristics of HMX-based composite propellants have been investigated, but the experimental data collected thus far is not sufficient to reveal the combustion mechanism. In this study, the burning characteristics of HMX-based propellants were measured using three HMX samples, each with different particle sizes, and six propellant formulations of each sample with HMX content varying from 55% to 80%. Then, the relationship of HMX particle size and content with the burning rate characteristics was revealed. The burning rate decreased and the pressure deflagration limit increased as the HMX content decreased. The pressure exponent increased as the particle diameter increased and the HMX content decreased. The propellant prepared with small HMX particles underwent steady-state combustion, and the burning surface was nearly flat. On the other hand, the burning surface of the propellant containing coarse HMX particles was very rough and coarse particles protruded from the burning surface. The protruding coarse HMX particles generated remarkable flashing flames. The flashing flames and rugged burning surface caused strong heterogeneous combustion in the vicinity of the burning surface. The burning rates at high pressure were barely dependent on the particle diameter, but those at low pressure decreased with increasing particle diameter. It was found that the HMX content, particle diameter, and pressure were the dominant factors in the assessment of the effects of particle size. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

An approach is developed to computationally predict and quantify the stochasticity of the ignition process in polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under impact loading. The method, the computational equivalent of carrying out multiple experiments under the same conditions, involves subjecting sets of statistically similar microstructure samples to identical overall loading and characterizing the statistical distribution of the ignition response of the samples. Specific quantities predicted based on basic material properties and microstructure attributes include the critical time to ignition at given load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition occurs. The analyses carried out focus on the influence of random microstructure geometry variations on the critical time to ignition at given load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition occurs. Results show that the probability distribution of the time to criticality (tc) follows the Weibull distribution. This probability distribution is quantified as a function of microstructural attributes including grain volume fraction, grain size, specific binder-grain interface area, and the stochastic variations of these attributes. The relations reveal that the specific binder-grain interface area and its stochastic variation have the most influence on the critical time to ignition and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition is observed. For a PBX with 95 octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7- tetrazocine content, the computationally predicted minimum impact velocity for ignition is in the range of 54-63 ms-1 depending on microstructure.

The physicochemical processes occurring within the foam layer, comprised of a liquid and gas bubbles, and a gas-phase region above the burning surface are considered. The chemical kinetics is represented by a global thermal decomposition mechanism within the liquid by considering 18 species and eight chemical reactions.

The pseudo-propellant burn rate was found to be highly sensitive to the global decomposition reactions of TAGzT. The predicted results of burn rate agree well with experimental burn-rate data. The increase in burn rate by inclusion of TAGzT is due in part from exothermic decomposition of the azotetrazolate within the foam layer, and from fast gas-phase reactions between triaminoguanidine decomposition products, such as hydrazine, and oxidiser products from the nitramine decomposition. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84855573963"

The series of QDs was investigated with respect to their ability to donate excited-state electrons to an electronwithdrawing explosive related compound (ERC). Electron transfer was monitored by observing the steady-state fluorescence signal and the excited-state lifetimes of the QDs in the presence of ERC1. Increased sensitivities of QDs towards ERC1 were observed as the size and emission wavelength of the QDs decreased. As the QDs size decreased, the Stern-Volmer quenching constants increased. The larger QD exhibited the lowest Ksv and is thought to be quenched by a purely static quenching mechanism. As QD size decreased, an additional collisional quenching mechanism was introduced, denoted by a non-linearity in the quenching-vs-concentration Stern-Volmer plot. Increases in quenching efficiency were due to increased excited-state lifetimes, and the introduction of a collisional quenching mechanism.

This point is further demonstrated in this study by calculations of ground state resonance structure associated with molecular clusters of the high explosives PETN and TNT using DFT, which is for the construction of parameterized dielectric response functions for excitation by electromagnetic waves at frequencies within the THz range. These dielectric functions provide for different types of analyses concerning the dielectric response of explosives. In particular, these dielectric response functions provide quantitative initial estimates of spectral response features for subsequent adjustment with respect to additional information such as laboratory measurements and other types of theory-based calculations. With respect to qualitative analysis, these spectra provide for the molecular level interpretation of response structure.

The strong donor-acceptor (D-A) interactions between EDA and trinitrotoluene (TNT) at the Au NP/solution interface induced significant aggregation of the EDA-capped Au NPs, and enabled to easily realize the direct colorimetric detection of ultratrace TNT. The results showed that such a color change was readily seen by the naked eye, and the colorimetric detection could be down to 400. pM level of TNT with excellent discrimination against other nitro compounds. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to examine the TNT-induced changes in local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of EDA-capped Au NPs, and a new LSPR band at ca. 630. nm arose along with the addition of TNT, which produced a detection limit of TNT down to ca. 40. pM. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering measurements evidenced the ultratrace TNT-induced small changes in the size of the EDA-capped Au NPs, and realized the quick and accurate detection of TNT in 0.4. pM level. These results demonstrated the ultrahigh sensitivity of this optical probe for TNT detection. Moreover, this optical probe is sample, stable, low-cost, and these excellent properties make it quite promising for infield and rapid detection of TNT. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84865547035"

This study analyzes the sensitivity of detonation characteristic lengths to the inter-component heat-transfer hypothesis required to obtain a closed set of governing equations. The slowest and the fastest transfers - isentropic reactants and thermal equilibrium, resp. - are investigated. Earlier studies were restricted to the thermodynamic phase plane and have found a weak effect of the transfer hypothesis on state variables. On the contrary, this analysis considers the chemical kinetic process. A state-sensitive Arrhenius reaction rate and two sets of constitutive parameters are used to generate three types of reaction profiles suited to most one-step energy releases in liquid explosives - specifically, long, balanced or short induction, relative to reaction. The chemical lengths and critical diameters of one- or two-dimensional detonations thus prove to be very sensitive to the transfer hypothesis - specifically much larger with the fastest - as well as to small variations of constitutive parameters. Importantly, the profile type is independent of transfer but not of parameters. Therefore, a pertinent response to a transfer change is to recalibrate the rate time-factor so as to keep constant some reference length, according to the profile type. For inductive or balanced profiles, any length can be used such as the CJ reaction length or the critical diameter. Asymptotic profiles require special attention because their length ratios depend on transfer. Constitutive parameters cannot be used with a transfer hypothesis different from that they were calibrated with. Too large experimental errors or numerically under-resolved calibrations may lead to skewed reaction profiles, and hence erroneous simulations of detonation dynamics. Thus, more accurate constitutive relations and information on steady reaction profiles in detonating liquid explosives are necessary. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-84876458078"

The application of NEMD to study the thermal transport in molecular solids was rarely attempted. We report the first application of NEMD based on the Ikeshoji and Hafskjold (NEMD-IH) scheme to study the thermal conductivity of crystalline hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX), an important energetic material, at temperatures T = 230, 275, and 300 K for different sample sizes and different crystallographic directions. We found that the size effects arising from a finite distance between sources of heat in the NEMD-IH simulation show a well-defined linear dependence on the inverse of the sample length within the errors of simulation. The thermal conductivity exhibits anisotropy with the largest value found along the [0 0 1] crystallographic direction and the smallest value along the [0 1 0] direction. The extrapolated value of the directionally averaged thermal conductivity coefficient κ̄ to the sample of infinite length (e.g. 0.355W/Km atT=300K) is higher, but still in reasonable agreement with existing experimental data for powdered samples. The NEMD-IH heat transport properties were reproduced in a broad range of values of heat flux and sizes of heat source regions. Surprisingly, the thermal conductivity coefficient at T = 275 K is found to be higher by about 13% than at T = 300 K and 230 K, which may suggest a location of the temperature maximum above 230 K. A similar location of the low temperature peak was reported from experiments on powdered samples of RDX. Through the use of additional calculations based on the Green-Kubo approach, we discuss the possible origins of such a behavior in the NEMD-IH approach. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

W). In this method, the microwave energy is supplied locally to the powder. It creates a confined hotspot, and initiates a self-propagating combustion in the entire powder volume. The coupled thermal-electromagnetic interaction evolved within the powder prior to its ignition is simulated theoretically, taking into account the powder's temperature-dependent parameters. The simulation results show a thermal-runaway instability and localized heating within a confined hotspot, induced mostly by the microwave's electric-field component. The experimental setup employs accordingly an open-end applicator implemented by a miniature solid-state microwave-drill device inserted into the thermite powder as a local igniter. The experimental results show ignition within ∼3. s at 2.1-GHz, 100-W microwave injection, in agreement with the theoretical model.

Constant and non-constant strain rate loading experiments were conducted in the use of pulse shapers. By comparing two different loads, the strain rate effect of these materials was found to depend on the instantaneous strain rate. The variations in failure stress, and failure strain with temperature, strain rate, and material composition were examined.

The aluminized RDX charges contained 20 wt. % of either 30-70 nm or 16-26 μm Al particles. Non-aluminized RDX charges were also studied for comparison. Spectra collected from the aluminized charges exhibited Al and AlO emissions during the first ∼60 μs, followed by a broadband emission that evolved over two time scales: one in the early time, 0-200 μsec, and another on late time, 0.5-10 ms. The apparent temperatures of the early-time fireballs were obtained using barium atom thermometry and were found to be ∼2900 K for the RDX-only charges, ∼3600 K for the RDX-micron Al charges, and ∼4000 K for the RDX-nano Al charges. In both types of aluminized samples, once Al and AlO emissions ceased, the fireballs began to cool and approached the temperature obtained for the non-aluminized RDX charges. For aluminized charges, a late-time luminescence was also observed, with the intensity and duration dependent upon the size of the Al particles. Aluminum nanoparticles yielded a higher early-time temperature, but a less intense and shorter duration late-time emission, while micron-sized particles produced a lower early-time temperature, but a longer-lived and more intense late-time energy release. These results indicate that post-detonation Al combustion occurs in multiple stages during the evolution of the fireball. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-84855928553"

In this paper, we studied the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of DNAN using Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) modified by l-cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride. Due to the formation of a Meisenheimer complex between DNAN and the modifier, the modified AgNPs can detect 20 μg/L (0.2 ng) and 0.1 mg/L (1 ng) DNAN in deionized water and aged tap water, respectively. Three other chemicals (l-cysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and l-cysteine ethyl ester hydrochloride) were used as AgNPs modifiers to study the mechanism of the SERS of DNAN. It was confirmed that the amino group of l-cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride was the active group and that the methyl ester group significantly contributed to the high SERS sensitivity of DNAN.

Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) was applied to characterize the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. For the guanidinium salts studied, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds are associated with a seven- or eight-membered pseudo-ring. The guanylurea cation is more helpful for improving the thermal stabilities of the ionic salts than other guanidinium cations. The contributions of different substituents on the triazine ring to the thermal stability increase in the order of -NO 2<-NF 2<-N 3 (-ONO 2)<-NH 2.

Moreover, the salts exhibit relatively high densities in the range of 1.62-1.89 g cm -3.

However, the reported fluorescence sensory materials (e.g., polymers) usually respond to a class of analytes (e.g., nitroaromatics), rather than a single specific target. Hence, the selective detection of trace amounts of trinitrotoluene (TNT) still remains a big challenge for fluorescence-based sensors. Here we report the selective detection of TNT vapor using the nanoporous fibers fabricated by self-assembly of carbazole-based macrocyclic molecules. The nanoporosity allows for time-dependent diffusion of TNT molecules inside the material, resulting in further fluorescence quenching of the material after removal from the TNT vapor source. Under the same testing conditions, other common nitroaromatic explosives and oxidizing reagents did not demonstrate this postexposure fluorescence quenching; rather, a recovery of fluorescence was observed. The postexposure fluorescence quenching as well as the sensitivity is further enhanced by lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the nanofiber building blocks. This in turn reduces the affinity for oxygen, thus allocating more interaction sites for TNT.

Emerging nanomaterial based sensors, particularly those developed by utilizing functionalized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a sensing component potentially offer many desirable features needed for threat agent detection. The sensitiveness of physical properties expressed by GNPs, e.g. color, surface plasmon resonance, electrical conductivity and binding affinity are significantly enhanced when they are subjected to functionalization with an appropriate metal, organic or biomolecular functional groups.

The explosives with both high energy densities and low sensitivities, or the so-called insensitive high explosives (IHEs), are desirable in most cases. It seems from applied explosives that amino groups are advantageous to IHE but the amount of amino groups contained IHEs is very limited. To make this clear, we present systemic examinations of the effects on the two properties stressed in IHEs after introducing amino groups to different molecular skeletons. As a result, the amino groups on resonant sites to nitro groups in conjugated systems can improve distinctly sensitivities and change energy densities in terms of oxygen balance; while the amino groups in unconjugated systems can hardly increase energy densities and usually cause increased sensitivities. It agrees well with a fact that almost all the molecules of applied amino group contained explosives possess conjugated skeletons.We therefore confirm that if amino groups are introduced resonantly to a nitro group in a conjugated system and the introduction improves OB, they are advantageous to IHEs. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","2-s2.0-84870482441"

Micrometer sized cantilevers are often used for label-free detection, and have previously been reported to be able to detect explosives. However, only a few measurements from 1 to 2 cantilevers have been reported, without any information on repeatability and reliability of the presented data. In explosive detection high reliability is needed and thus a statistical measurement approach needs to be developed and implemented. We have developed a DVD-based read-out system capable of generating large sets of cantilever data for vapor and liquid phase detection of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Gold coated cantilevers are initially functionalized with tetraTTF-calix[4]pyrrole molecules, specifically designed to bind nitro-aromatic compounds. The selective binding of DNT molecules on the chemically treated surfaces results in significant bending of the cantilevers and in a decrease of their resonant frequencies. We present averaged measurements obtained from up to 72 cantilevers being simultaneously exposed to the same sample. Compared to integrated reference cantilevers with non-selective coatings the tetraTTF-calix[4]pyrrole functionalized cantilevers reveal a uniform and reproducible behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of resolved shear stress induced by uniaxial compression along three shock directions normal to (110), (011), and (010) planes leads to identify eight slip systems as candidates for shear deformation. For each of the eight slip systems, non-equilibrium reactive dynamics simulations were carried out to determine thermal, mechanical, and chemical responses to shear deformation. Shock direction normal to (010) plane exhibits large shear stress barriers arising from steric hindrance between molecules of adjacent layers leading to local dramatic energy and temperature increases under shear flow that in turn accelerate chemical bond breaking and initial product formation processes, promoting further molecular decomposition and eventually transition to detonation. This suggests that single crystal β-HMX is sensitive to shocks in direction normal to (010) plane. Shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes reveal significantly less steric hindrance, leading to more modest energy and temperature increases followed by slower chemical reaction initiation. Thus, shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes are less sensitive than shock direction normal to (010) plane, which agree with interpretations from currently available plate impact experiments on HMX. This validation of CS-RD and ReaxFF for characterizing sensitivity of single crystal energetic materials indicates that these methods can be applied to study sensitivity for more complex polymer bonded explosives and solid composite propellants having complex microstructures, corrugated interfaces, as well as defects. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-84863520768"

Several bioanalytical methods and biosensors based on portable devices have been developed for this purpose. Among them, Lateral Flow ImmunoAssays (LFIAs) offer the advantages of rapidity and ease of use and, thanks to the high specificity of antigen-antibody binding, allow greatly simplifying and reducing sample pre-analytical treatments. However, LFIAs usually employ colloidal gold or latex beads as labels and they rely on the formation of colored bands visible by the naked eye. With this assay format, only qualitative or semi-quantitative information can be obtained and low sensitivity is achieved. Recently, the use of enzyme-catalyzed chemiluminescence detection in LFIA has been proposed to overcome these problems. In this work, we describe the development of a quantitative CL-LFIA assay for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in real samples. Thanks to the use of a portable imaging device for CL signal measurement based on a thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera, the analysis could be performed directly on-field.

The cage strain energies of polynitroadamantanes and polynitrocubanes increase gradually with the increase of the nitro-substituted number. However, the increase of the cage strain energies of polynitroadamantanes is less drastic than that of polynitrocubanes; on the contrary, the decrease of the bond dissociation energies of C-NO 2 bonds in the former compounds is more rapidly than the latter. Accordingly, the cage strain energies and bond dissociation energies of C-NO 2 bonds play different roles in determining the stability of high-energy compounds. An increase in the number of nitro groups may be advantageous to the performance and oxygen balance, but disadvantageous to the stability; an increase of cage strain energy may result in a decrease of stability, but more energy will release when a cage opening occurs. Rational number of nitro groups and proper cage strain energy are indispensable for an ideal nitro-containing explosive with high energy but insensitive to external impact.

Generally there are two separate problems in the field of recognition of explosives: first - detection of the trace concentration of explosives by analytical methods (gas chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, neutron activation analysis) and the second - the estimation of the state of explosives during their time storages in the military objects. In the second problem the concentration of a vapor of explosives is at level of sub-parts-per million where chemosensors technique is fully applicable. This paper is concerned with the second type problem. It defines the recognition criteria providing stable and robust basis for the recognition of different explosive materials. The important part of this procedure performs the 2-dimensional convolution of the differential signals formed on the basis of two sensor arrays used in the construction of the differential nose.

In this review, we provide a brief summary of chemical threats of homeland security importance; focus in detail on modern concepts in chemical sensing; examine the origins of the most significant unmet needs in existing chemical sensors; and, analyze opportunities, specific requirements, and challenges for wireless chemical sensors and wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

A decrease in the surface area, as well as morphology changes, in PETN has been observed during aging. Commercially, water is used in the production of PETN which suggests an uninvestigated stability control factor. In this article, single crystals of PETN were grown by solvent evaporation method from acetone at room temperature in absence and presence of different weight ratios of de-ionized water. The effect of presence of water in the starting solution of PETN on its thermodynamic properties was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning Calorimetry. The TGA study suggests an important role for water in manipulating thermodynamic parameters of PETN via the expected hydrogen bonding. The DSC results suggest the presence of bound water molecules as impurity in PETN single crystals. The data could be used to form PETN crystals with desired physical properties optimal for either storage or initiation. This study suggests that, in the equilibrium conditions, water could be used in a cheap, tunable, and precise manner to control the stability of PETN crystals against coarsening. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Samples were prepared in the form of pellets (pressed powders), thread-like monocrystals and thin plate polycrystals. A special laser complex was used to perform the experiments. It provided multiparameter measuring of different processes in explosive decomposition of samples. These processes are glowing of decomposing sample, glowing from the irradiated area only, sample acoustic response, shape and energy of a laser pulse. The time resolution for all the experiments made 5 ns and synchronization accuracy made 10 ns. It was found that silver azide demonstrates high sensitivity to laser radiation in its transparent spectral region (1064 nm and 532 nm). The explosion initiation energy threshold made 4-8 mJ/cm 2 for both pressed powders with the free surface and for samples with the covered and pressed by a quartz plate surface. Silver azide crystals require approximately 10 times higher energy density to explode. When the samples were acted by UV laser radiation, their sensitivity was from 50 to 500 times lower for the uncovered samples. The covered and pressed samples demonstrated the sensitivity which was close to that for acted by 1064 nm laser radiation. Equal sensitivity of samples to laser radiation with different wavelengths testifies to non-photochemical nature of explosion initiation.

The use of dilute H 2O 2 to clean chemical vessels is common, but it has been shown to be potentially hazardous due to the reaction of H 2O 2 with organic solvents to form explosive peroxides. Mixing concentrated H 2O 2 and acetone with an acid catalyst is known to form the shock and friction sensitive explosives triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP). A search of the chemical literature was unable to identify any directly applicable research or technical information that addressed the potential formation of explosive peroxides when mixing dilute H 2O 2 and acetone solutions. The conclusion of these experiments is that when mixing dilute solutions, such as less than 3% H 2O 2 and 7% acetone, the solutions are unlikely to form significant amounts of TATP or DADP. In the presence of an acid catalyst, hundreds of parts per million of organic peroxides can be formed. Although TATP is relatively insoluble in water, it is soluble at roughly the 15ppm level and higher for acetone and H 2O 2 solutions, thus any acetone peroxides that are formed without acid catalyst should remain soluble in the aqueous cleaning solution. © 2011 Division of Chemical Health and Safety of the American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84862807935"

The non-isothermal reaction model of HMX varies with experimental temperature, while that of CL-20 adheres only to one. The isothermal reaction rate constants of the two samples both increase exponentially with the rise of temperature. It may be due to the accelerating autocatalysis in the solid-state thermal decomposition. DVST as an accelerated aging method was also applied to predict the storage life of materials.

Here, we report that nanomolar concentrations of zinc metal nanoparticles strongly enhanced olfactory responses to the explosives related odorants cyclohexanone, methyl benzoate, acetophenone, and eugenol. Rat olfactory epithelium was exposed to metal nanoparticles and odorant responses were quantified by EOG. Zinc nanoparticles added to explosive odorants strongly increased the odorant response in a dose-dependent manner. The enzymatic breakdown of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was prevented by adding the membrane-permeable phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). This caused the olfactory cilia cAMP concentration to increase and generated EOG signals. The EOG responses generated by IBMX were not enhanced by zinc nanoparticles.

In a previous study, it has been demonstrated that isolated, rigorously purified, TATP may degrade to form a series of chlorinated acetones when directly treated with excess concentrated hydrochloric acid. The current study extends this work to examine whether this phenomenon may be measured during the more feasible scenario of aging of rudimentarily purified TATP contaminated with trace reaction mixture. It was demonstrated that solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of aged TATP that was synthesized utilizing hydrochloric acid catalyst may identify the presence of the degradation products chloroacetone and 1,1-dichloroacetone. Upon aging of TATP synthesized utilizing either sulfuric or nitric acid catalyst, no acid specific degradation products could be identified. These findings may be exploited by forensic chemists in the analyses of TATP samples. © 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","2-s2.0-84865861223"

PETN has received major attention as an insensitive, high energy explosive; however, the mechanism and dynamics of the decomposition of this material are not clear yet. The initial decomposition mechanism of PETN is explored with nanosecond energy resolved spectroscopy and quantum chemical theory employing the ONIOM algorithm at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. The nitric oxide (NO) molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from PETN at three UV excitation wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm) with a pulse duration of 8 ns. Energies of the three excitation wavelengths coincide with the (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) vibronic bands of the NO A 2Σ+ ← X 2Π electronic transition, respectively. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for PETN, which generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (∼20 K) and a vibrationally hot (∼1300 K) distribution. Potential energy surface calculations at the ONIOM(CASSCF:UFF) level of theory illustrate that conical intersections play an important role in the decomposition mechanism.

Raman hot spots can spontaneously form in a reversible way by the self-approaching of flexible nanotubes driven through the capillary force of solvent evaporation. Meanwhile, the PABT-TNT-PABT bridges between self-approaching silver nanotubes possibly form by the specific complexing and zwitterion interactions, and the resultant chromophores can absorb the visible light that matches with the incident laser and the localized surface plasmon of a silver nanotube array.

Upon exposure to TNT or its derivatives the bound antibodies were displaced producing a large change, several folds higher than the noise, in the resistance/conductance of SWNTs giving excellent limit of detection, sensitivity and selectivity. The sensor detected between 0.5. ppb and 5000. ppb TNT with good selectivity to other nitroaromatic explosives and demonstrated good accuracy for monitoring TNT in untreated environmental water matrix.

Finally in an attempt to increase detection sensitivity of on-line mid-IR detection, mid-IR quantum cascade lasers have been used. Applications cover the field of food analysis, environmental analysis and the characterization of explosives among others. Best detection sensitivities for on-line and off-line detection have been achieved in miniaturized systems and are in the order of 50. ng and 2. ng on column, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77957969465"

ToF-SIMS was able to successfully discriminate between different C-4 samples with the aid of principal component analysis, a multivariate statistical analysis approach often used to reduce the dimensionality of complex data. ToF-SIMS imaging was also used to obtain information about the spatial distribution of the various additives contained within the samples.

Mechanical characterization of SU-8/CB nanocomposite thin films was performed using the nanoindentation technique with an appropriate substrate effect analysis. Piezoresistive microcantilevers having an optimum carbon black concentration were fabricated using a design aimed at surface stress measurements with reduced fabrication process complexity. The optimal range of 8-9vol% CB concentration has resulted in an improved sensitivity, low device variability and low noise level. The resonant frequency and spring constant of the microcantilever were found to be 22kHz and 0.4 Nm-1 respectively. The devices exhibited a surface stress sensitivity of 7.6ppm (mNm -1)-1 and the noise characterization results support their suitability for biochemical sensing applications.

The net effect of this energy transport on the detonation is unclear. It could enhance the detonation by precompressing the explosive near the wall. Alternatively, it could decrease the explosive performance by crushing porosity required for initiation by shock compression or destroying confinement ahead of the detonation. At present, these phenomena are not well understood. But with slowly detonating, non-ideal high explosive (NIHE) systems becoming increasing prevalent, proper understanding and prediction of the performance of these metal-confined NIHE systems is desirable. Experiments are discussed that measured the effect of ANFO detonation energy transported upstream of the front by a 76-mm-inner-diameter aluminum confining tube. Detonation velocity, detonation front-shape, and aluminum response are recorded as a function of confiner wall thickness and length. Detonation shape profiles display little curvature near the confining surface, which is attributed to energy transported upstream modifying the flow. Average detonation velocities were seen to increase with increasing confiner thickness, while wavefront curvature decreased due to the stiffer, subsonic confinement. Significant radial sidewall tube motion was observed immediately ahead of the detonation. Axial motion was also detected, which interfered with the front-shape measurements in some cases. It was concluded that the confiner was able to transport energy ahead of the detonation and that this transport has a definite effect on the detonation by modifying its characteristic shape. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.

The pumping mechanism is simultaneous resonant two-photon dissociation of molecular oxygen and resonant two-photon pumping of the atomic oxygen fragments.

The detection of different kind of explosive agents has become crucially important for protection of human lives, infrastructures, and properties. Moreover, both the environmental aspects such as the risk of soil and water contamination and health risks related to the release of explosive particles need to be taken into account. For these reasons, there is a growing need to develop analyzing methods which are faster and more sensitive for detecting explosives. The detection techniques of the explosive materials should ideally serve fast real-time analysis in high accuracy and resolution from a minimal quantity of explosive without involving complicated sample preparation. The performance of the in-field analysis of extremely hazardous material has to be user-friendly and safe for operators. The two closely related ion spectrometric methods used in explosive analyses include mass spectrometry (MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The four requirements-speed, selectivity, sensitivity, and sampling-are fulfilled with both of these methods. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2-s2.0-80052148760"

Thin films comprised of a conjugated polymer are used to amplify the emission of an emissive receptor via energy transfer. We propose that the energy transfer is dominated by an electron-exchange mechanism to an upper excited state of the fluorophore followed by relaxation and emission to account for the efficient energy transfer in the absence of appreciable spectral overlap. Exposure to cyclic ketones results in a ratiometric fluorescence response. The thin films show orthogonal responses when exposed to cyclic ketones versus acyclic ketones. We demonstrate that the exquisite selectivity is the result of a subtle balance between receptor design and the partition coefficient of molecules into the polymer matrix. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-80051755627"

Analytical models are developed in order to explain the dependency of the combustion times on the particle diameter. Experimental evidence shows that there exists, for carbonaceous and metallic materials, mainly two combustion regimes that are either kinetically controlled, for small size particles, or diffusion controlled, for large size particles. From the experimentally measured combustion data of those materials, the dependencies of the ignition temperature and the minimal explosive concentration (MEC) with regard to the particle size have been analyzed. We found that the two combustion regimes yield two different tendencies with respect to the particle size. Overall, it is found that as the particle size decreases, minimum ignition temperature (MIT) and minimum ignition energy (MIE) decrease, indicating higher potential inflammation and explosion risks for the use of nanopowders. By contrast, the minimal explosion concentration (MEC) did not show strong variations as the particle size decreases. Rather, a theoretical plateau is observed, which was experimentally confirmed. We also observed that carbon nanopowders exhibit a low propensity to explode while metallic nanopowders can be very reactive, thus delineating high potentials for explosion risks in manufacturing facilities. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77954542574"

The imprinting process involves the electropolymerization of thioaniline-functionalized Au NPs (3.5 nm) on a thioaniline monolayer-modified Au surface in the presence of a carboxylic acid, acting as a template analogue for the respective explosive. The exclusion of the imprinting template from the Au NPs matrix yields the respective imprinted composites. The binding of the analyte explosives to the Au NPs matrixes is probed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, SPR, where the electronic coupling between the localized plasmon of the Au NPs and the surface plasmon wave leads to the amplification of the SPR responses originating from the dielectric changes of the matrixes upon binding of the different explosive materials. The resulting imprinted matrixes reveal high affinities and selectivity toward the imprinted explosives.

All calculations, including optimizations, charge analysis and 15NNitro NMR chemical shifts, were performed using density functional (DFT) methods with 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. The results show a linear correlation between the nitro group charges and C/N-nitro bond lengths. The latter reflect the strength of the corresponding bond and thus the stability of the nitro compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the heat of detonation with the charge and 15N NMR chemical shift on the nitro group in nitramines and nitro paraffins. Nitro compounds with a higher heat of detonation have less negative nitro group charges, (QNitro) and a lower value for the 15NNitro chemical shift in analogous compounds. From the quantitative models, the heat of detonation increase when the QNitro values (positive coefficient) are larger and decrease when the 15NNitro NMR chemical shift (negative coefficient) is higher.

The unprotonated free base, previously postulated in the literature to be the colored product, was now prepared and fully characterized. It shows totally different spectroscopic properties from the dark red compound. Similarly, the analogous free base of the reaction between urea nitrate and the one-vinyl shorter reagent, p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, was synthesized and characterized. Similar differences between the free and protonated forms were observed.

Three-dimensional numerical simulations of explosion fields from 1.5-g PETN/TNT charges were performed. Explosions in six different chambers were studied: three calorimeters (volumes of 6.6-L, 21.2-L and 40.5-L with L/D = 1), and three tunnels (L/D = 3.8, 4.65 and 12.5 with volumes of 6.3-L) - to investigate the influence of chamber volume and geometry on the combustion process. Predicted pressures histories were quite similar to measured pressure histories for all cases studied. Experimentally, mass-fraction of products, YPexp, reached a peak value of 88% at an excess air ratio of twice stoichiometric, and then decayed with increasing air dilution; mass-fractions YPcalc computed from the numerical simulations followed similar trends. Based on this agreement, we conclude that the dominant effect that controls the rate of TNT combustion with air is the turbulent mixing rate; the ILES approach along with the fast-chemistry model used here adequately captures this effect. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.

In this work, we optimized geometries and calculated the electron density of 17 nitroaromatic molecules using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. From the DFT one-electron density matrix, we computed the molecular charge densities, thus the electron densities, which were then decomposed into electric multipoles located at the atomic sites of the molecules using the distributed multipole analysis (DMA). The multipoles, which have a direct chemical interpretation, were then used to analyze in details the ground state charge structure of the molecules and to seek for correlations between charge properties and sensitivity of the corresponding energetic material. The DMA multipole moments do not present large variations when the size of the Gaussian basis set is changed; the largest variations occurred in the range 10-15% for the dipole and quadrupole moments of oxygen atoms. The charges on the carbon atoms of the aromatic ring of each molecule become more positive when the number of nitro groups increases and saturate when there are five and six nitro groups. The magnitude and the direction of the dipole moments of the carbon atoms, indicators of site polarization, also depend on the nature of adjacent groups, with the largest dipole value being for C-H bonds. The total magnitude of the quadrupole moment of the aromatic ring carbon atoms indicates a decrease in the delocalized electron density due to an electron-withdrawing effect. Three models for sensitivity of the materials based on the DMA multipoles were proposed. Explosives with large delocalized electron densities in the aromatic ring of the component molecule, expressed by large quadrupole values on the ring carbon atoms, correspond to more insensitive materials. Furthermore, the charges on the nitro groups also influence the impact sensitivity. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-80051768959"

For such nanocomposite materials prepared by Arrested Reactive Milling (ARM), the exothermic reactions leading to ignition were detected to begin at relatively low temperatures. These materials are prepared by mechanical processing at room temperature, and the nature of the interface present between aluminum and the oxidizer (metal oxide, e.g., CuO, MoO3, Bi2O3, etc.) is unknown. Experiments using a Thermal Activity Monitor (TAM III) quantify the reaction rates between aluminum and CuO at temperatures between 303 and 373K. Results of the present TAM III measurements and results of earlier measurements using differential scanning calorimetry for the same 2Al·3CuO nanocomposite are interpreted considering two different reaction models. The rate-limiting step is described either as a conventional thermally activated diffusion, or using the Cabrera-Mott model developed originally for oxidation of fresh metal surfaces. It is shown that the thermally activated diffusion model is inadequate for description of the low-temperature reactions observed in nanocomposite thermites prepared by ARM.

We use a combination of steady-state Stern-Volmer analysis and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to determine the underlying mechanisms by which fluorescent sensing materials comprised of fluorene-based chromophores sense nitro-based explosive analytes. The ability of two first-generation dendrimers comprised of bifluorene-containing chromophores to sense explosive analytes was compared with the chemically related polymer poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluoren-2,7- diyl). One dendrimer was planar with a single chromophore with the second having four chromophores tetrahedrally arranged around an adamantyl center. All the materials had high photoluminescence quantum yields of around 90% and were able to sense explosive analytes via quenching of their fluorescence. The three-dimensional dendrimer based upon the adamantyl core was found to have the highest Stern-Volmer constants for all the analytes tested with the planar dendrimer also proving to be on average superior to the polymer. The TRPL measurements showed that sensing occurred by a combination of collisional and static quenching with the proportion of collisional quenching being based on the number of aromatic units in the analyte. Steady-state fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements of the three materials revealed that for the three-dimensional dendrimer an exciton can migrate between all of the chromophores, meaning that an exciton formed on one chromophore of the dendrimer can be quenched by an analyte interacting with a second chromophore. This gives rise to the potential for sensing response amplification and explains its superior performance to the planar dendrimer and polymer. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-78650465294"

Facets are evident and crevices form in this thickness range. The surface evolution behavior is attributed to bulk surface diffusion and the presence of an Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier, which preferentially enhances step-up diffusion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The emitted long lifetime room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of the resultant nanomaterials allows an appropriate delay time so that any fluorescent emission and scattering light can be easily avoided. The APTES anchored on the layer of silica can bind 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) species to form TNT anion through acid-base pairing interaction, the TNT anion species may increase the charge-transfer pathways from the nanocrystals to nitroaromatic analytes, therefore further enhance the quenching efficiency of RTP. Moreover, APTES as capped reagents can enlarge the spectral sensitivity and enhance RTP response of nanocrystals to the electron-deficient nitroaromatic and nitrophenol species. Meanwhile, AF MnD ZnS QDs also exhibited a highly selective response toward TNT analyte through significant color change and quenching of 4T 1 to 6A1 transition emission.

The carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of UN and its component ions, urea and nitrate, could aid in a forensic investigation. A method was developed to separate UN into its component ions for δ15N measurements by dissolving the sample with KOH, drying the sample, followed by removal of the urea by dissolution into 100% methanol. UN was synthesized to assess for preservation of the carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of reactants (urea and nitric acid) and product UN. Based on nitrogen isotope mass balance, all UN samples contained varying amounts of excess nitric acid, making the ionic separation an essential step in the nitrogen isotope analysis. During UN synthesis experiments, isotopic composition of the reactants is preserved in the product UN, but the urea in the product UN is slightly enriched in 15N (<1‰) relative to the reactant urea. Published isotopic compositions of UN reactants, urea and nitric acid, have large ranges (urea δ15N=-10.8 to +3.3‰; urea δ13C=-18.2 to -50.6‰; and nitric acid δ15N=-1.8 to +4.0‰). The preservation of isotopic composition of reactants in UN, along with a significant variability in isotopic composition of reactants, indicates that isotope ratio analysis may be used to test if urea or nitric acid collected during an investigation is a possible reactant for a specific UN sample. The carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios differ significantly between two field-collected UN samples, as well as the lab-synthesized UN samples.

The results show that both perchlorate ions coordinate with the copper atom, and the interactions between copper and perchlorate are ionic, whereas all the metal-carbohydrazide interactions are covalent. Due to the delocalization from the σN-H bond orbital to the n*M antibond orbital, the amino stretching vibrations of these complexes show considerable red-shift compared with those of free carbohydrazide ligand. The calculated heats of reaction and formation indicate that the formations of these complexes are exothermic, and the order of their thermal stability is NiCP>CoCP>CuCP. These agree well with the experimental results. Finally, we find that there is a relationship between the energy gap and impact sensitivity. © 2010.","2-s2.0-77952889344"

For all measurements, the absorbance is found to peak during the early period of high reactivity of post-detonation gases. The characteristic attenuation length is less than 1 cm during the peak absorption period, and remains on the order of centimeters until a significant decrease in optical depth occurs about 160 μs after the detonation.

It is stated that the thermal stability of BCHMX is higher than that of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). The longest N{single bond}N bond in the BCHMX molecule (1.412(4) Å) is the cause for its higher impact reactivity, which is at the level of that of penterythritol tetranitrate (PETN). In the experimentally determined detonation velocity, BCMX can be slightly better performing than RDX.

Data concerning the degradation of TNT reported during the period 1990-2009 are evaluated in this review. Among the AOPs, the following techniques are successively debated: processes based on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2+UV, Fenton, photo-Fenton and Fenton-like processes), photocatalysis, processes based on ozone (O3, O3+UV) and electrochemical processes.

Boron is attractive as a fuel or a fuel supplement in propellants and explosives due to its high heats of combustion on both a gravimetric and volumetric basis. A relatively large database exists for combustion characteristics of large (greater than 1 μm) boron particles, but very little exists for nano-sized boron. Ignition and combustion characteristics have been studied in the post flame region of a fuel lean CH4/Air/O2 flame, with burner temperatures ranging from about 1600 K to 1900 K, and oxygen mole fractions ranging between 0.1 and 0.3. As in earlier investigations on boron combustion, a two-stage combustion phenomenon was observed. Ensemble-averaged burning times of boron nanoparticles were obtained, while the ignition time measurements for boron nanoparticles were extended into a lower temperature range previously unavailable in the literature. The measured burning times were between 1.5 ms and 3.0 ms depending on both the temperature and oxygen mole fraction. The ignition times were relatively insensitive to oxygen concentration in the range studied, and were affected only by temperature. The measured ignition times were inversely related to the temperature, ranging from 1.5 ms at 1810 K to 6.0 ms at 1580 K.

The activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of ammonium nitrate decomposition were determined to be 102.6 kJ mol-1 and 4.55 × 107 s-1 without the presence of pyrite and 101.8 kJ mol-1 and 2.57 × 109 s-1 with the presence of pyrite.

It was shown that the presence of pyrite reduces the temperature for, and accelerates the rate of, decomposition of ammonium nitrate. It was further shown that pyrite can significantly reduce the critical temperature of ammonium nitrate decomposition, causing undesired premature detonation of the explosives.

To solve the problems in research for lithium ion batteries, we suggested that zinc and lithium oxides should be used as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. So, we design unconventional emulsion explosives, and synthesize zinc and lithium oxides by means of deflagration firstly. Also, microstructures and morphology of nanometer thin sheets in the deflagration soot of emulsion explosives are measured in our experiments; namely, we surveyed and analyzed products with the implement of XRD, TEM and FTIR. It is concluded that nanoparticles of lithium and zinc oxides can be synthesized through deflagration of the unconventional emulsion explosive. Main contents and research results are as follows: First, unconventional emulsion explosives for synthesis of zinc and lithium oxides are designed firstly, and we also discuss mechanics of deflagration. In the final analysis, we succeeded in synthesizing nano-sheets of zinc and lithium oxides by deflagrating at the fist time. Second, we tested microstructures of nanometer thin sheets of lithium and zinc composite oxides. Third, by contrast to industrial emulsion explosives, we analyzed the deflagration mechanics of the unconventional emulsion explosives. Last, zinc and lithium nanooxides are successfully collected and validated by XRD, TEM and FTIR exactly. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-73249140576"

Chemical detection on the other hand may also provide such spatial location, but the actual position of the landmine is not necessary under the surface of that point. Although this hypothesis seems logical, it has never been proven. This paper presents numerical simulations in 3D (using LaGriT and FEHM codes developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories) of the fate and transport of TNT released from a landmine under changing environmental conditions (such as rainfall and solar radiation). To assess the numerical techniques, we compare numerical simulations to experimental data previously obtained. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-70349197500"

TATP and HMTD were securely synthesized, taken up with acetone, hydrolyzed with 4 M HCl to hydrogen peroxide, the acidic solution containing H2O2 was neutralized, and assayed by the copper(ii)-neocuproine spectrophotometric method. The chromophore of the reaction was the Cu(i)-neocuproine chelate responsible for light absorption at 454 nm. The molar absorptivity (ε) of the method for TATP and HMTD was 3.45 × 104 and 4.68 × 104 L mol-1 cm-1, respectively. The TATP recovery from a synthetically contaminated loamy clay soil was 91-99%. The colorimetric method was also applied to a Cu(ii)-neocuproine-impregnated polymeric Nafion membrane sensor developed for the first time in this work for peroxide explosive assay. The absorbance-concentration response was perfectly linear, and the limit of detection (LOD) of the procedure for both TATP and HMTD was approximately 0.2 mg L-1. Neither common soil ions (Ca2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, Mg2+ and NO 3-) at 100-fold amounts nor military-purpose nitro-explosives of TNT, RDX, and PETN at 10-fold amounts interfered with the proposed assay.

To improve the nitrogen sensitivity or measurement times of the TNA detector, higher gamma ray rates will be required. The chief bottleneck to achieving the maximum possible performance from the present TNA or future versions is the relatively slow fluorescent decay time of the NaI(Tl) scintillators which are currently used. An experimental investigation was undertaken to compare a number of modern, fast inorganic scintillators to NaI(Tl) with respect to parameters relevant to TNA landmine detection, including efficiency, energy resolution, linearity, available size and cost.

The size of RDX nanoparticles and their distribution in the Cr2O3 matrix have an important influence on their reactivity. The reactive properties of nanostructured RDX differ significantly from those of classical micron-sized RDX.

Based on the frequencies scaled by 0.96 and the principle of statistic thermodynamics, the thermodynamic properties were evaluated, which were linearly related with the number of methylene groups as well as the temperature, obviously showing good group additivity. Detonation performances were evaluated by the Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on the calculated densities and heats of formation. It is found that density, detonation velocity, detonation pressure are decrease with the increase of the number methylene groups. Thermal stability and the pyrolysis mechanism of the title compounds were investigated by calculating the bond dissociation energies (BDE) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.

Experimental studies were made using various laboratory prepared polymeric membranes, primarily through blending of polymers and the results are analyzed through the measurements of flux and selectivity. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and ethyl cellulose (EC) polymers, in different ratios, were blended to prepare membranes in order to vary the ratios of hydrophilic-hydrophobic characteristics. The objective was to characterize blended membranes in terms of measurement of contact angle, X-ray diffraction (XRD), positron annihilation techniques (PAL), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile strength. Sorption studies helped in estimating equilibrium sorption, which further enhanced understanding towards pervaporation selectivity. It was evident from the results that blended polymers could be useful to develop newer membranes with improved perm-selectivity. Further, adjusting blend composition pervaporation properties could be varied. Analysis of results is based on normalizing the values of flux with respect to thickness, in order to develop better understanding of blended properties of membranes.

PC1 separated the compounds due to molecular weight, PC2 separated the different isomers, PC3 arranged the compounds according to different functional groups such as nitrobenzoic acids, nitrobenzenes, nitrotoluenes and nitroesters and PC4 differentiated the compounds containing chlorine from other compounds.

The parameters of the distributions of the probability of ignition are determined by the maximum likelihood method; normal, logistic, lognormal and Weibull distributions have been used. Confidence bands for the probability points are obtained both from the asymptotic standard errors of the parameters and by a bootstrap-like technique.

A critical hotspot can be seen as one end of the temperature distribution produced in a heterogeneous material by a shock. Studying shock sensitivity in a granular explosive thus allows insight into the temperature distribution produced by a shock in a granular material. In the case of cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), a commonly used explosive, no consensus exists on the dominant features which promote critical hotspots. We present an investigation of the morphology and sensitivity of seven batches of RDX in two size classes and with a range of morphologies. Both the individual crystal morphology and the bulk granular morphology were studied and the features likely to interact with a shock in a granular material to form a critical hotspot are identified. We find that the internal void count does not correlate with the sensitivity of a granular bed and that crystals with defects can be insensitive in such a charge.

There has been a paradigm shift in the predictive capability of solid-propellant combustion models as the field has advanced from a simple and global-kinetics approach to a detailed approach that employs elementary reaction mechanisms in the gas phase, and accommodates thermal decomposition and subsequent reactions in the condensed phase. The detailed models not only allow calculation of propellant burning-rate characteristics, such as pressure and temperature sensitivities, but also of the surface conditions and entire combustion-wave structure, including the spatial variations in temperature and species concentrations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the modeling and simulation of various solid-propellant ingredients over a wide range of ambient conditions. The specific materials of concern include nitramines (RDX, HMX), azides (GAP), nitrate esters (NG, BTTN, TMETN), ADN, and AP monopropellants, as well as homogeneous mixtures representing binary (RDX/GAP, HMX/GAP, and AP/HTPB) and ternary (RDX/GAP/BTTN) pseudo-propellants. Emphasis is placed on the steady-state combustion and laser-induced ignition of nitramines. The capabilities and deficiencies of existing approaches are addressed. In general, the detailed gas-phase reaction mechanisms developed so far represent the chemistry of monopropellants and associated mixtures consistently well, and help understand the intricate processes of solid-propellant combustion. The reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, however, still pose an important challenge. Furthermore, the current knowledge of the initial decomposition of molecules emerging from the propellant surface is insufficient to render the models fully predictive. Modeling is thus not yet a predictive tool, but it is a useful guide. In the near future, it is likely that detailed combustion models can assist in the formulation of advanced solid propellants meeting various performance and emission requirements. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A 1D plane numerical model was developed for estimating the thermodynamic and the dynamic state of the boiling liquid during a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) event. Based on the choice of the initial nucleation sites density, the model predicts, simultaneously, the bubble growth processes in the liquid at the superheat-limit state, the front velocity of the expanding liquid, and the shock wave pressure formed by the liquid expansion through the air. Conditions of shock formation were found to be normally associated with high initial temperatures that can bring the liquid to its superheat-limit state during the initial depressurization. Furthermore, the high initial temperature also induces a generation of higher vapor pressures that forces a rapid mixture expansion.

The structural-dynamic/ballistic response of the Rolled Homogenized Armor (RHA) used in the construction of the VIMF witness plate and the remainder of the VIMF and the hydrodynamic response of the TNT high-energy explosive of a mine and of the air surrounding the VIMF are represented using the standard materials models available in literature.

The results obtained indicate that the use of the modified compaction model yields a substantially better agreement with the experimentally-determined impulse loads over the use the original compaction model. Furthermore, the results suggest that, in the case of fully saturated sand, the blast loading is of a bubble type rather than of a shock type, i.e. the detonation-induced momentum transfer to the witness plate is accomplished primarily through the interaction of the sand-over-burden (propelled by the high-pressure expanding gaseous detonation by-products) with the witness plate. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-42149096549"

An ignition and growth model and the Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equations of state were employed. The simple mixture rule assumes that the reacting explosive is a simple mixture of the reactant and product components. Four different assumptions, such as that of thermal equilibrium and isotropy, were adopted to calculate the pressure. The main purpose of this paper is to present the answer to the question of why the numerical results of shock-initiation are insensitive to the assumptions adopted. The equations of state for reactants and products were assessed by considering plots of the specific internal energy E and specific volume V. If the slopes of the constant-pressure lines for both components in the E-V plane are almost the same, it is demonstrated that the numerical results are insensitive to the assumptions adopted.

The quality of landmine detection affects directly the efficiency and safety of this process. Most of the available methods to detect explosives and landmines are limited by their sensitivity and/or operational complexities. All landmines leak with time small amounts of their explosives that can be found on surrounding ground and plant life. Hence, explosive signatures represent the robust primary indicator of landmines. Accordingly, developing innovative technologies and efficient techniques to identify in real-time explosives residue in mined areas represents an attractive and promising approach. Biological and biologically inspired detection technology has the potential to compete with or be used in conjunction with other artificial technology to complement performance strengths. Biological systems are sensitive to many different scents concurrently, a property that has proven difficult to replicate artificially. Understanding biological systems presents unique opportunities for developing new capabilities through direct use of trained bio-systems, integration of living and non-living components, or inspiring new design by mimicking biological capabilities. It is expected that controlled bio-systems, biotechnology and microbial techniques will contribute to the advancement of mine detection and other application domains.

It is remarkable that under the supersaturated condition ultrasonic irradiation could significantly accelerate the crystal formation, in which the purity of 2,4-DNT reaches to approximate 98.9 wt%.

Our main focus is on the study of the Βδ phase transformations (PTs) in crystalline HMX under a complex pressure-temperature path. To reproduce the pressure-temperature path, in particular during heating of PBX inside of a rigid cylinder, the Βδ PTs in HMX are coupled to chemical decomposition of the HMX and binder leading to gas formation, gas leaking from the cylinder, elastic, thermal, and transformational straining as well as straining due to mass loss. A fully physically based thermodynamic and kinetic model of the Βδ PT in HMX crystal is developed. It is based on a suggested nucleation mechanism via melt mediated nanocluster transformation and the recently revealed growth mechanism via internal stress-induced virtual melting. During the nucleation, nanosize clusters of the Β phase dissolve in a molten binder and transform diffusionally into δ phase clusters. During the interface propagation, internal stresses induced by transformation strain cause the melting of the stressed δ phase much below (120 K) the melting temperature and its immediate resolidification into the unstressed δ phase. These mechanisms explain numerous puzzles of HMX polymorphism and result in overall transformation kinetics that is in good agreement with experiments. Simple phenomenological equations for kinetics of chemical decomposition of the HMX and the binder are in good correspondence with experiments as well. A continuum deformation model is developed in two steps. The geometrically linear (small strain) theory is used to prove that the internal stresses and macroscopic shear stresses are negligible. Then a large strain theory is developed under hydrostatic loading. The developed continuum thermomechanochemical model is applied in the accompanying paper [V. I. Levitas, B. F. Henson, L. B.

The results indicated that the EEBCFM was sensitive to temperature, especially to heating rate and could decompose at the temperature up to 60°C. The maximum speed of decomposition (dα/dT)m at the heating rate of 5 and 7.5°C min -1 was more than 10 times of that at 2.5°C min-1 and nearly 10 times of that of the second-category coal mine permitted commercial emulsion explosive (SCPCEE). The plenty of metal ions could seriously reduce the thermal stability of emulsion explosive, and the decomposition reaction in the conversion degree range of 0.0∼0.6 was most probably controlled by nucleation and growth mechanism and the mechanism function could be described with Avrami-Erofeev equation with n=2. When the fractional extent of reaction α>0.6, the combustion of oil phase primarily controlled the decomposition reaction. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-38949207522"

The particle momentum effects associated with this two-phase flow have been investigated experimentally and numerically for a heterogeneous explosive consisting of a packed bed of inert particles saturated with a liquid explosive. Experimentally, the dispersion of the particles was tracked using flash radiography and high-speed photography. A particle streak gauge was developed to measure the rate of arrival of the particles at various locations. Using a cantilever gauge and a free-piston impulse gauge, it was found that the particle momentum flux provided the primary contribution of the multiphase flow to the near-field impulse applied to a nearby small structure. The qualitative features of the interaction between a particle and the flow field are illustrated using simple models for the particle motion and blast wave dynamics. A more realistic Eulerian two-fluid model for the gas-particle flow and a finite-element model for the structural response of the cantilever gauge are then used to determine the relative contributions of the gas and particles to the loading. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-34250630991"

DAAF has received major attention as an insensitive high energy explosive; however, the mechanism and dynamics of the decomposition of this material are not clear yet. In order to understand the initial decomposition mechanism of DAAF and those of its model systems, nanosecond energy resolved and femtosecond time resolved spectroscopies and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations have been employed to investigate the excited electronic state decomposition of these materials. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from DAAF and its model systems at three UV excitation wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm) with a pulse duration of 8 ns. Energies of the three excitation wavelengths coincide with the (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) vibronic bands of the NO A +2 X 2 electronic transition, respectively. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for DAAF, which generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (20 K) and a vibrationally hot (1265 K) distribution. On the contrary, excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels are observed for the model systems, which generate the NO product with both rotationally cold and hot distributions depending on the excitation wavelengths. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF level of theory illustrates that two conical intersections between the excited and ground electronic states are involved in two different excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels for the model systems. Femtosecond pump-probe experiments at 226 nm reveal that the NO molecule is still the main observed decomposition product from the materials of interest and that the formation dynamics of the NO product is faster than 180 fs. Two additional fragments are observed from furazan with mass of 40 amu (C2 H2 N) and 28 amu (C H2 N) employing femtosecond laser ionization. This observation suggests a five-membered heterocyclic furazan ring opening mechanism with rupture of a CN and a NO bond, yielding NO as a major decomposition product. N H2 is not observed as a secondary decomposition product of DAAF and DAF. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-38349195344"

A stoichiometric (Fe2O3 + 2Al) and four over aluminized mixtures were tested. The combustion products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy and the influence of Fe2O3/aluminum ratio on their composition was assessed. The main products were identified as alumina (α-Al2O3) and iron (Fe). A significant amount of hercynite (FeAl2O4) was detected, decreasing with the aluminum excess in the reactants. Close to the sample/confinement interface, where reaction quenching occurs, a non-stoichiometric alumina (Al2.667O4) was observed, being its XRD intensity correlated to the hercynite amount. Fe3Al intermetallic phase was found in the products of over aluminized mixtures. A reaction mechanism was proposed comprising: (i) Fe2O3 reduction to Fe3O4 and FeO; (ii) Al oxidation to Al2O3; (iii) interaction of the remaining Al with Fe3O4 and FeO with formation of iron-aluminates (hercynite) and iron; (iv) for the over aluminized mixtures, incorporation of Al into the iron-aluminates takes place with the formation of iron and alumina and, in parallel, Al reacts with iron to produce intermetallics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The said relationship was used to predict the Arrhenius parameters (Ea and log A values) of four plastic explosives based on RDX and one high explosive based on PETN (Semtex). The slopes EaR-1 of Kissinger's equation were specified by means of non-isothermal differential thermal analysis (DTA) and evaluation of the measurement results by means of the Kissinger method. The role played by binders and plasticizers in thermal decomposition of nitramines was pointed out on the basis of relationship between the Ea values obtained from VST and the EaR-1 values obtained from DTA, both for plastic explosives, eight nitramines, Composition B and PETN. The relationships between the EaR-1 values and thermostability threshold was specified for the given group of explosives. The relationship classify some of the studied plastic explosives as belonging to nitramines with steric hindrance in the molecule (CPX, TNAZ and HNIW). The relationship between EaR-1 values and drop energies, Edr, sharply differentiates between plastic explosives and individual nitramines. From the relationship between the Edr and D2 values it was found that the increasing performance of the studied nitramines and plastic explosives is connected with the decrease in their impact sensitivity. Also specified are the approximate linear dependences between the peak temperatures of exothermic decomposition of all the explosives studied and their ignition temperatures, Tig, or critical temperatures, Tc; these dependences were applied to prediction of Tig and Tc of both the studied plastic explosives and some of the nitramines. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular dynamics (MD) method was employed to investigate their binding energies (E bind), compatibility, safety, mechanical properties, and energetic properties. The information and rules were reported for choosing better binders and guiding formulation design of high energy density material (HEDM). According to the calculated binding energies, the ordering of compatibility and stability of the five PBXs was predicted as ε-CL-20/PEG > ε-CL-20/Estane5703 ≈ ε-CL-20/GAP > ε-CL-20/HTPB > ε-CL-20/F2314. By pair correlation function g(r) analyses, hydrogen bonds and vdw are found to be the main interactions between the two components. The elasticity and isotropy of PBXs based ε-CL-20 can be obviously improved more than pure ε-CL-20 crystal. It is not by changing the molecular structures of ε-CL-20 for each binder to affect the sensitivity. The safety and energetic properties of these PBXs are mainly influenced by the thermal capability (C°p) and density (ρ) of binders, respectively. © 2007 Science in China Press.","2-s2.0-36849092895"
