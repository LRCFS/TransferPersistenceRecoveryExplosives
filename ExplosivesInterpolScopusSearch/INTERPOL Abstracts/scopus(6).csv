This study was intended to determine the basic physicochemical properties of MeNQ as well as potential environmental fate pathways. The solubility of MeNQ was determined to be 12.92±0.52 g/L and aqueous photolysis was found to efficiently degrade the munition, where its quantum yield and half-life were found to be 0.009 and 0.59 days, respectively. Hydrolysis was an insignificant degradation pathway resulting in 8.1 % degradation at pH 4, 2.6 % at pH 7, and 6.2 % at pH 9 after five days at an elevated temperature. Volatilization at environmentally relevant conditions was found to be insignificant as the molecule thermally degrades, leading to an inability to calculate Henry's Constant for volatilization from water. Spectroscopic (UV-vis, FTIR, NMR) and analytical (HPLC) studies were undertaken and are shown alongside the parent molecule, NQ, for comparison to characterize the emerging munition. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85107212593"

We propose the use of paper spray ionization–high-resolution mass spectrometry (PSI-HRMS) for detection of peroxide explosives in biological matrices. Occurrence of peroxide explosives and/or their metabolites in biological samples, obtained from urine or blood tests, give scientific evidence of peroxide explosives exposure. PSI-HRMS promote analysis of samples in situ by eliminating laborious sample preparation steps. However, it increases matrix background issues, which were overcome by the formation of multiple alkali metal adducts with the peroxide explosives. Multiple ion formation increases confidence when identifying these peroxide explosives in direct sample analysis. Our previous work examined aspects of TATP metabolism. Herein, we investigate the excretion of a TATP glucuronide conjugate in the urine of bomb-sniffing dogs and demonstrate its detection using PSI from the in vivo sample.

NTO is being used widely as a component of insensitive munition (IM) composites such as IMX-101, a formulation that is being used to replace the more shock sensitive TNT in artillery shells. The alkylation of NTO with methyl iodide (MeI) as the derivatization reagent was performed in acetone solution at room temperature using triethylamine (Et3N) as a base catalyst. The methylated product of NTO derivatization was identified as 4-methyl-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (MNTO). Accurate and reproducible results were achieved by systematic optimization of MeI and Et3N concentrations and reaction time. Isotopic values of MNTO obtained by GC-IRMS were normalized against those of two 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) in-house reference materials that had been calibrated with isotopic standard reference materials, USGS40 and USGS41a.

Numerous studies have reported the application of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for the stable-isotope analysis of AN. However, in real cases, AN is often mixed with liquid hydrocarbons, organic explosives, wood flour, and sodium chloride. Therefore, the purification of AN samples prior to IRMS analysis is essential. Based on the different solubilities of AN at different temperatures, AN samples were purified by recrystallization. The results show that recrystallization can effectively purify AN, and the isotope fractionation effect caused by recrystallization increases the stable-isotope ratio (δ15N increased by 0.07–0.14‰, δ18O increased by 0.15–0.33‰, and δ2H increased by 4.61–18.16‰). The change of δ15N and δ18O were close to the standard deviation values, and did not affect the differentiation of AN. δ2H was deemed unsuitable for AN differentiation, owing to isotopic exchange during recrystallization. Eight AN samples from different cities and four AN samples produced in different years and batches from the same manufacturer in China were analyzed after recrystallization. Both groups of AN samples could be distinguished by combining the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. Therefore, recrystallization can be used as a means of AN purification for the accurate determination of AN in ammonium nitrate fuel oil and explosive residues. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85115746932"

The predominant experimental factors such as type and amount of deep eutectic solvent, extraction time, salt concentration and temperature that affect the extraction efficiency of nitroaromatic explosives were considered and optimized. By performing the process in optimal conditions, the calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.6–200 µg/L for 2,4,6-trinitrotolouene (TNT), 0.5–200 µg/L for 2,4-dinitrotolouene (2,4-DNT) and 0.5–200 µg/L for 2,6-dinitrotolouene (2,6-DNT). The limits of detection were 0.19, 0.16 and 0.14 µg/L for TNT, 2,4-DNT and 2.6-DNT, respectively. The relative standard deviations were between 4.8–6.4% (n = 6).

Landmines emit a chemical flux over time, and honeybees can collect the trace residues of explosives (as particles or as vapour) on their body hairs. This capability was exploited using a passive method allowing the honeybees to freely forage in a mined area, where trace explosives present in the environment stuck to the honeybee body, which were subsequently transferred onto an adsorbent material for analysis by a fluorescent polymer sensor. Potential false positive sources were investigated, namely common bee pheromones, the anti-varroa pesticide Amitraz, and the environment around a clean apiary, and no significant response was found to any from the sensor. The mined site gave a substantial response in the optical sensor films, with quenching efficiencies of up to 38%.

Through this platform, the recrystallized PETN was produced with a particle size of about 2 μm, and its SSA was above 70-fold that of the raw PETN. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that the raw and microcrystalline PETN had a similar diffraction spectrum. The thermal analysis demonstrated that compared with the raw PETN, the microcrystalline PETN revealed better decomposition performances. Importantly, the short-duration pulse shock initiation sensitivity of microcrystalline PETN pellets was evaluated when subjected to an exploding foil initiator. The shock initiation threshold results were as follows: 50 % initiation voltage U (50 %)=1332 V, the corresponding capacitor storage energy was 195.2 mJ. Furthermore, the calculated shock pressure and shock duration imparting to the pellets were 9.61 GPa and 12.53 ns respectively, corresponding to the 3162 m/s threshold velocity.

The developed HCD ion source coupled MS system has also been validated as an analytical method to analyze explosives at trace levels. The ion source was designed in such a way that the plasma can be generated alternatively at high pressure (~30 Torr), medium pressure (~5 Torr) and low pressure (~1 Torr) regions. The plasma contains a sufficient amount of reactant ions, electrons and excited species, thus the gaseous analyte molecules were efficiently ionized when they passed through the plasma. In the ion-molecule reactions of the nitroaromatic explosives, the discharge products of NOx− (x = 2,3), O3 and HNO3 originating from the plasma-excited air were suggested to contribute to the formation of mostly [M − H]-, [M − NO]-, [M+NO3–HNO2]- and [M-NO+HNO3]- adduct ions at the higher ion source pressures (~5 and 28 Torr) while the electron rich plasma leads to the formation of molecular ion, M−•, at the lower ion source pressure (~1 Torr).

The variety of spectral patterns in the air-assisted glow discharge would be useful for high through-put detection of TNT and TNT-related explosives.

Through gap test, the shock pressure histories at different inner positions of the target TNT charges were measured. The parameterization on shock initiation model proposed by Lee & Tarver for numerical simulation were accomplished. The equation of state for unreacted explosive in the model was obtained by fitting Hugoniot data calculated from molecular dynamic simulation and shock temperature based on Walsh's solution.

However, simple, rapid, and on-site detection methods of TATP are still lacking. Herein, we present a visual colorimetric method for on-site and rapid detection of TATP based on a Fe(ii)-promoted thermal decomposition process of TATP. We discovered that TATP can be decomposed into H2O2 under heating conditions, and it reacts with Fe2+ to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH) and Fe3+via the Fenton reaction. The resulting OH and Fe3+ further oxidize colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a yellow oxidized product (oxTMB). These reaction processes remarkably promote the chemical equilibrium shift and decrease the activation energy. Using the TATP-Fe2+-TMB ternary chromogenic system, the present colorimetric assay for TATP shows a dynamic range of 0.5-30 μM with a low detection limit of 0.12 μM. Additionally, common substances (e.g., inorganic salts, small organic substances, and polymers) do not interfere with TATP detection. This assay can be used for analyzing TATP in real water and camouflage samples. Furthermore, a test-paper-based method was also successfully developed for visual, rapid and on-site detection of TATP.

The propellant composition has a significant influence on the shapes of the heat flow curves. To assess the stability on a firmer base, it is of interest to know what contributions to the total heat flow the individual reactions have from the NC decomposition and from the stabilizer reactions. This needs the simulation of the heat flow curves based on the individual reactions with their thermochemical data and their reaction rates. For this, the reaction enthalpies of all relevant reactions must be known. On these prerequisites was reported in part 1. With the data from there, the simulation of the heat flow curve of the ball powder propellant type K6210 was undertaken, using a reaction scheme for the nitrate ester decomposition and the DPA reactions.

The use of in-situ thermocouples for temperature measurements within multiphase fireballs is demonstrated. Although the thermocouple temperature lags behind the local gas temperature, the transient gas temperature is assessed by modeling the sensor assuming first-order response and using two analysis methods: (1) when the thermocouple temperature trace reaches a local extrema, the thermocouple temperature is instantaneously equal to the local gas temperature, and (2) reconstructing the gas temperature trace using multiple co-located thermocouples of different lag responses.

The thermal performance and decomposition kinetics were investigated by means of the nonisothermal DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) techniques. Additionally, simultaneous DSC-FTIR were employed to corroborate the thermal analysis results. The compatibility of the various admixtures was confirmed through an additional kinetic study for which the Arrhenius parameters were computed by different isoconversional Kissinger method and modified Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method. The decomposition products were also detected by in-situ DSC-MS-FTIR. The obtained results from the different techniques are presented and discussed. © 2021","2-s2.0-85116922014"

In a typical screening process, a trap is used to probe a surface of interest to collect and transfer particulate residue to a detector for analysis. The collection of residues from the surface being probed is widely viewed as the limiting step in this process. A multi-institutional study was performed to establish a methodology for the evaluation of sampling media collection efficiencies. Dry deposited residues of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), C-4 (an RDX-based explosive), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were harvested from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic, ballistic nylon (NYL), and uncoated aluminum surfaces using muslin, Texwipe cotton, and stainless-steel mesh traps. Transfer and collection efficiencies of the sample media were calculated based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Dry transfer efficiencies (DTE%) to all tested surfaces were greater than 75%, with transfer to ABS plastic being the lowest. Collection efficiency (CE%) varied significantly across the traps and the surfaces, yet some conclusions can be drawn; nylon had the lowest CE% for all cases (∼10%), and the stainless steel mesh had the lowest CE% for the evaluated traps (∼20%). Though the testing parameters have been standardized among the participants to establish a framework for an independent comparison of contact sampling media and surfaces, substantial variations in the DTE% and the CE% were observed, suggesting that other variables can affect contact sampling.

According to the relationship between load and time, displacement was deduced. The correctness and reliability of the displacement were confirmed by comparing it with the displacement by the digital image correlation method (DIC). Combined with a high-speed camera, the impact process image was collected, and the initial fracture point was determined by the load-displacement curve. Then the impact absorbing energy corresponding to the initial fracture point was obtained by integrating the displacement with a load. The transverse impact strength of the propellant can be acquired based on the initial cross-sectional area of the sample. By comparison, it is found that the coefficient of variation and dispersion degree of the measurement results by the proposed method at low and room temperature are significantly less than those by the traditional pendulum test. That is, the consistency and repeatability of the proposed method are better. The result proves the feasibility and reliability of the method based on the initial fracture impact absorbing energy to measure the transverse impact strength of propellants. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85108915580"

For this purpose, an experimental setup consisted of a sun spectrum lamp and hyper-spectral camera was built to illuminate and image white powder samples of BCHMX in comparison with the traditional explosives, HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane), RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane), PETN (2,2-Bis[(nitroxy)methyl]propane-1,3-diyldinitrate).

The calculated pressure histories in both TATB-based LX-17 and HMX-based PBX9501 are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the shock initiation behavior of the HMX-based PBX is mainly controlled by the number density of hot spots and shows an accelerated reaction characteristic and that of the TATB-based PBX is determined by the combustion reaction process, which featured by a stable reaction characteristic.

The goal of this study was to determine to what extent intact molecules of high explosive (HE) compounds are detectable and quantifiable from post-detonation dust and particulates in a field experiment with varied topography. We focused on HMX (1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), which is less studied in field detonation literature, as the primary explosive material and RDX (1,3,5-Trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine) as the secondary material. The experiment was conducted at Site 300, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Experimental Test Site, in California, USA. Two 20.4 kg and one 40.8 kg above ground explosions (primarily comprised of LX-14, an HMX-based polymer-bonded high explosive) were detonated on an open-air firing area on separate days. The complex terrain of the firing area (e.g., buildings, berm, low-height obstacles) was advantageous to study HE deposition in relation to plume dynamics. Three types of samples were collected up to 100 m away from each shot: surface swipes of aluminum plates, surface swipes of fixed objects, and filters from air samples. We used atmospheric flow tube-mass spectrometry (AFT-MS) to quantify picogram levels of molecular residue of HE material in the post-detonation dust. An aliquot of sample extract in methanol (e.g., 1 μL of 0.5 mL) was placed onto a resistive material and then thermally desorbed into the AFT-MS. We successfully detected and quantified both HMX and RDX in many of the samples. Based on mass (pg) detected and solution dilution, we back-calculated the mass collected on the swipe or filter (ng per sample). The aerial distribution of molecular residue was consistent with the path of the plume, which was strongly determined by wind speed and direction at the time of each shot. The quantity of material detected appeared to correlate more with distance from the shot and the wind conditions than with shot size. This study demonstrates that the picogram detection levels of AFT-MS are well-suited for quantification of analytes (e.g., HMX and RDX) in environmental samples. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85100679127"

In the advent of more sophisticated technology, anthropologic methods can now be applied into post mortem imaging interpretation. The traditional imaging roles of characterizing osseous fragmentation, detecting and localizing foreign bodies can be expanded to simulate and support physical anthropologic examination to assist in documentation for court proceedings. Case presentation: An assemblage of unidentified, incomplete, highly fragmented skeletal remains were found scattered on a bare area of land in a forest. There was evidence of an explosion given the pattern of scattered evidentiary material of explosive and ballistic nature. Laboratory analysis of white powder found within the explosive material confirmed the presence of high impact C4-explosive trace containing cyclotrimethylene trinitramin [Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX)] & pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). It took meticulous multidisciplinary efforts to confirm the identity of the victim that was marred by the severe fragmentation and skeletalization of the remains. The initial radiologic interpretation focused more on identification of foreign bodies and supporting documentation of fragmentation. With the current availability of post computed tomography (PMCT) in our center, we reexamined the value and potential of PMXR and PMCT as an adjunctive tool for biological profiling. Conclusion: This was the first case of C4-blast related death reported in Malaysia. The multidisciplinary approach in efforts to identify the victim may serve as a guide in managing, coordinating and maximizing the expertise of different forensic specialists, with emphasis on anthropologic and radiologic collaboration. © 2021","2-s2.0-85114990529"

Both phlegmatized peroxides passed the Koenen Tube and Thermal Stability Test according to the UN recommendation on the transport of dangerous goods test manual. Investigations with a process mass spectrometer indicate that d40-TATP can produce a saturated TATP headspace at least in the same time as the same amount of pure TATP. Measurements with the transpiration method demonstrated that the vapor pressure (Formula presented.) at 298.15 K of d40-TATP (2.3 Pa) and d32.7-TATP (0.9 Pa) is lower than that of pure TATP (6.7 Pa).

At ambient temperatures (∼20 °C) the Knoop hardness number varied between 20.5 kg mm−2 and 24.0 kg mm−2 with crystal orientation. At higher temperature (50 °C) the Knoop hardness anisotropy curve retained its shape, although the overall hardness decreased by 10 %.

The classification process with the SVM algorithm separates this study from others. In line with this, instead of an external magnetic field source, in this study, the Earth's magnetic field was used with a TE100 fluxgate sensor, which has very low power consumption, used as a magnetic sensor to develop a highly sensitive new magnetic measurement and detection system. The system identifies anomalies in the vertical component of the Earth's magnetic field due to the magnetic characteristics of the buried sample in order to determine both the coordinates of the buried object within the scanning field and the upper surface geometry. The system is formed using a five-axis movement CNC platform including sensors and camera. Software was developed using python programming language with a QT graphical user interface (GUI) in order to control the CNC platform, take photographs of the soil, and process sensor data to ensure identification of the upper surface shape of the object under the soil. After obtaining all data for a 30×30 cm2 scanning area, the software colors the data from blue to red and visualizes this transparently above a photograph of the soil on the monitor. After this stage, a model is created using thresholding, selective search algorithm, and SVM in order to identify the location and upper surface shape of the sample located within the measurement region.

Methods A retrospective study was conducted in the Percy Military Hospital (role 4 medical treatment facility) among French soldiers who presented with a combat-related blast injury of the hand between 2002 and 2018. The functional result was assessed by the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) and the Orthotics and Prosthetics User Survey (OPUS, upper extremity functional status) scores. Proximal amputations (PAs) and distal amputations (DAs) were distinguished for the analysis. Results Fifteen patients with a mean age of 31±8 years were included. They totalised 20 blasted hands. There were 16 traumatic amputations: 8 in each of the PA and DA groups. Twelve patients had additional injuries, four of which were polytraumatic. Skin closure time and flap use were higher in the DA group. Only one thumb reconstruction was performed. At a mean follow-up of 6.5±4 years, the number of amputees wearing a prosthesis was higher in the PA group. The mean DASH and OPUS scores were 35.5%±24.0% and 64.0%±19.0%, respectively, with no difference between the two groups. Conclusion The severity of hand blasts related to warfare explosive devices requires the systematic application of damage control surgery. PAs are frequent and secondary reconstruction options are limited. The functional result is poor and similar between proximal and distal amputees.  © 2021 Authors","2-s2.0-85120604872"

The rheological characteristics of CL-20 based PBX slurry showed that the interaction between explosive particles and binder was changed with different surface wettability of CL-20. The weaker interaction between CL-20@hydrophobic and binder lead to weaker solid-liquid friction, resulted in lower apparent viscosities of CL-20@hydrophobic based PBX slurry at high shear rate.

The UN was prepared from lab grade urea, fertiliser urea, urea cold packs, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and Osmocote plant feed, resulting in six samples of UN as the Osmocote plant feed produced a blue and yellow product due to variation between products purchased at different times. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy revealed no notable differences between the samples apart from the blue UN product, which had a distinct peak in the IR spectra at 1150 cm−1. The Osmocote products could be discriminated by scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and ion chromatography (IC), as bulk samples contained a range of trace metals and ions. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) found 9 elements present at varying concentrations throughout the samples. The Osmocote products could be identified by the concentration of manganese, copper, and molybdenum while the DEF product could be discriminated as it contained a high concentration of nickel compared to other samples. ICP-MS has potential to further discriminate between the lab grade, fertiliser and cold pack samples, however, additional statistical and chemometric analysis is necessary. This study highlights that seized UN can be identified as being prepared from DEF or an Osmocote product, and contributes to the forensic intelligence of improvised explosives by reporting how UN can be commercially sourced, prepared and characterised. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85122810835"

Methods: Of the 82 injured cases admitted to the emergency department within the first six hours after the explosion, those who were radiologically evaluated were included in this retrospective and descriptive study. To analyze and identify the distribution of primary, secondary, and tertiary injuries, they were classified according to the body areas as head-neck, thorax, abdominopelvic, extremity, and vertebra. Results: The mean age (mean ± SD) of 63 patients included in the study was 28.6 ± 10.2 years. Twenty-four (38.1%) of the injured patients were female and 39 (61.9%) were male. Secondary blast injury was the most common type of injury in the study group with a rate of 39/63 (62%). The total number of bomb fragments was 235, of which 113 (47.8%) were seen in the head and neck region, followed by 86 (36.5%) in the extremities. There were 10 patients (15.9%) with lung injury and 13 (20.6%) with tympanic membrane perforation due to the primary blast mechanism. Conclusion: Radiological imaging plays an important role in identifying specific findings and patterns of explosive injuries. Therefore, we consider that patients with stable hemodynamics should be radiologically examined for a fast and accurate diagnosis or treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85107693587"

For them, it is an unexpected existential ‘event’ clearly separating a ‘before’ from an ‘after’. In the academic disaster domain however the ‘disaster as event’ is being eroded both by complexity approaches and critical approaches, which both, if for different reasons, consider disaster ‘normal’. By the example of the Enschede, the Netherlands, urban fireworks explosion of 2000 I argue that we should not only celebrate community resilience but take much more seriously how disasters may paralyse and traumatize individuals and communities. The application of Giddens' ‘ontological security’ to urban disaster foregrounds the importance for the disaster-affected population of regaining a sense of continuity and trust in the living and regulatory environment. Retaining (cultural) memory, also mediated through the arts, supports long-term rehabilitation.

Specifically, the use of organic component and stable isotope analysis techniques, such as bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA) and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) techniques, for the study of shotshell propellants was investigated. Methods: Nine samples of shotshell propellants from different manufacturing countries and brands were analyzed for explosive and additive components by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography. BSIA of the propellants was achieved using elemental analysis/isotope ratio mass spectrometry without a pretreatment process. For the CSIA of nitroglycerin, double-base powder propellants were extracted with ether, and the isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Results: Nine samples drawn from seven brands in four countries were classified into five groups by organic component analysis, while eight classification groups were identified by BSIA. Thus, two samples could not be distinguished from each other by either BSIA or organic component analysis. Subsequently, with the use of results obtained with CSIA for nitroglycerin, all the samples could be classified into different groups. These findings suggest that the nine propellant samples were all composed of different ingredients or raw materials from different sources. Conclusions: Stable isotope ratio analyses were performed for propellant discrimination. The combined BSIA, CSIA and organic component analysis techniques were able to successfully distinguish the nine shotshell propellants from seven brands sourced from four different countries, and the results suggested that the samples contained different ingredients or raw materials from different sources. We therefore can conclude that reliable results can be obtained using combined isotope analysis methods such as CSIA and BSIA for origin tracing and identity determination. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2-s2.0-85103900210"

A typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene (TPE) polymerizes into PTPE to increase the fluorescence intensity in the SAMs, and the phosphoric acid acts as the anchor group to form stable covalent bonds with the Al2O3 substrate.

The polymeric SAM sensors are prepared on the Al2O3 silicon wafer and testing paper. Both of them show good response speed, reversibility, selectivity, and sensitivity. The detection limits down to 0.07, 0.35, and 4.11 ppm for TNT, DNB, and NB, respectively, are achieved on the inorganic testing paper.

And the results were compared with the thermal decomposition behaviors of the binary systems TNT/AlO RDX/AlO and TNT/RDX. The partially passivated nano-aluminum particles were constructed and then mixed with TNT supercell, RDX supercell, and the constructed TNT/RDX supercell. The obtained mixed systems were then heated to a high temperature, where the explosive was completely decomposed.

The results show that the aluminum nanoparticles in the ternary system are easier to diffuse and spreads more widely.

We aimed to investigate the impact of low-level blast exposure on underlying white matter (WM) microstructure based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) in SWAT personnel before and after breacher training. Diffusion tensor imaging is an advanced MRI technique sensitive to underlying WM alterations. NODDI is a novel MRI technique emerged recently that acquires diffusion weighted data from multiple shells modeling for different compartments in the microstructural environment in the brain. We also aimed to evaluate the effect of a jugular vein compression collar device in mitigating the alteration of the diffusion properties in the WM as well as its role as a moderator on the association between the diffusion property changes and the blast exposure. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one SWAT personnel (10 non-collar and 11 collar) completed the breacher training and underwent MRI at both baseline and after blast exposure. Diffusion weighted data were acquired with two shells (b = 1,000, 2,000 s/mm2) on 3T Phillips scanners. Diffusion tensor imaging metrices, including fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, and NODDI metrics, including neurite density index (NDI), isotropic volume fraction (fiso), and orientation dispersion index, were calculated. Tract-based spatial statistics was used in the voxel-wise statistical analysis. Post hoc analyses were performed for the quantification of the pre- to post-blast exposure diffusion percentage change in the WM regions with significant group difference and for the assessment of the interaction of the relationship between blast exposure and diffusion alteration. Results: The non-collar group exhibited significant pre- to post-blast increase in NDI (corrected P <. 05) in the WM involving the right internal capsule, the right posterior corona radiation, the right posterior thalamic radiation, and the right sagittal stratum. A subset of these regions showed significantly greater alteration in NDI and fiso in the non-collar group when compared with those in the collar group (corrected P <. 05). In addition, collar wearing exhibited a significant moderating effect for the alteration of fiso for its association with average peak pulse pressure. Conclusions: Our data provided initial evidence of the impact of blast exposure on WM diffusion alteration based on both DTI and NODDI. The mitigating effect of WM diffusivity changes and the moderating effect of collar wearing suggest that the device may serve as a promising solution to protect WM against blast exposure.  © 2021.","2-s2.0-85119523138"

Here, a reductionist approach was taken to assess the impact of force, time, and rotation on the transfer of an explosive compound. An Instron ElectroPuls E3000 material testing instrument was used to bring porous and non-porous surfaces adulterated with an ammonium nitrate into direct contact with a human skin analogue, controlling for the force of contact, duration of contact, and rotation applied during contact. Quantifiable amounts of ammonium nitrate were recovered from all of the recipient surfaces demonstrating that ammonium nitrate is readily transferred from one surface to another, even when contact occurs for a short duration with a relatively low force. More particulates were transferred from non-porous surfaces onto the human skin analogue, but the amount of ammonium nitrate transferred did not depend upon the force of contact, duration of contact, or the amount of rotation applied. However, when contact occurred and involved rotation, a greater transfer of ammonium nitrate was observed, compared to those contacts occurring without rotation being applied. This approach complements more commonly-used holistic experiments that test multiple interacting variables in a realistic setting by isolating these variables, allowing them to be examined individually. This can be utilised to better understand the individual impact that specific variables have on the transfer of trace evidence in relevant crime reconstruction contexts. © 2021 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","2-s2.0-85122917139"

The existence of detonation in energetic porous silicon remains contested and would theoretically feature several unique behaviors illustrated by this study. Calculations to predict detonation performance are performed using CHEETAH thermochemical code for silicon porosities of 45–85 % surrounding 69 %, which represents an experimentally typical case. Uniquely, e-PS detonation is predicted to produce low gas volume. At 69 % porosity, condensed detonation products comprise 78 % of the mass (varying from 86 % to 46 % for 45–85 % porosity), and therefore a low TNT equivalent mechanical energy of 0.429 (but 1.32 when comparing total detonation energy). The calculated pressure of detonation for 69 % porosity is 1.065 GPa, only about 4 % of that of typical military explosives but over 50 times greater than compression wave amplitudes estimated for fast-burning nanothermites, which are comparable heterogenous fuel/oxidizer composites. At porosities above 67 %, computed detonation velocities are shown to exceed estimates for the unreacted speed of sound and therefore a detonation structure consistent with classical CJ theory is proposed. Indeed, published maximum experimental propagation speeds for energetic porous silicon in this upper porosity range when pore size is optimal agree well with CHEETAH computations of detonation velocity, thereby supporting that detonation is possible. Below 66 % porosity, sound speed in unreacted material overtakes the calculated detonation velocities. Traditionally this precludes formation of a detonation wave since the shockwave would decay as energy propagates ahead acoustically into unreacted material. However, experimental agreement is still observed between 60–67 % porosity. By comparing computed detonation pressure with estimates for the strength of unreacted porous silicon, this range is proposed to be a transition zone in which a detonation-like structure could be maintained, despite the inverted sound speed comparison, by rapid catastrophic fracture of porous silicon at the detonation front. This hypothesis implies that a sonic precompression wave must precede the detonation wave since at least a minor fraction of shock energy would propagate ahead in unreacted material. Finally, comparisons are made with baseline primary explosives and nanothermites showing that among metal-based composite energetics on the basis of reaction rate and detonation pressure, energetic porous silicon currently exhibits the most promise for replacing primary explosives at reasonable densities in igniters and augmenting initiator formulations. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85106670072"

Current strategies for desensitizing PBXs come at the expense of a significant reduction in performance. A possible method for desensitizing PBX without adverse performance effects is the multifunctional tailoring of mechanical properties through strategic incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) directly into the binder phase. In this work, a fabrication method is presented that produces polymer bonded simulants (PBS) of PBX that incorporate MWCNTs into the binder phase, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). These materials were characterized via microscopy and unconfined quasi-static compression testing to determine the effects of MWCNTs. Quasi-static compression showed evidence of a MWCNT induced structural skeleton effect that provided the binder with an increased strength, load transfer, and a greater ability to resist strain localizations prior to failure. These enhancements demonstrate the potential of using MWCNTs to enhance energetic materials. © The Author(s) 2021.","2-s2.0-85100567382"

Hence, this paper aims at measuring the minimum ignition temperature (MIT) of existing and boron blended firework composition by using Godbert Greenwald furnace. Nowadays, many firework industries are employing automation. In such places, by limiting the level of oxygen supply with Nitrogen gas, the accidents can be avoided. Hence, the limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) is also measured.

However, the underlying mechanism of ANP in energetic materials during ignition is unclear. Based on the ReaxFF-lg method, the oxidation mechanism of ANP in pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) was analyzed from an atomic perspective, and the evolution of ANP from single and multi-particle models during ignition were studied. Adding ANP increases the heat release and accelerates the decomposition of PETN. ANP inhibits CO2 emissions and increases H2O yields. Both particle size and passivated layer influence the oxidation mechanisms due to different surface effects. The oxidation mechanism of smaller ANP is dominated by Al atom diffusion, but the larger ANP involves O inward diffusion and Al outward diffusion at both solid and melting states. An important behavior of chained C/Al clusters accumulation was observed during the later combustion, which agrees with the earlier experiments. The lattice diffusion aggregation of ANP and the aggregations of O/Al and C/Al cluster were revealed during the reaction.

The ignition and growth model was incorporated in smoothed particle hydrodynamics to calculate the pressure generated by the detonation of aluminized explosive, and the after-burning combustion model was used to obtain the released energy caused by the combustion of aluminium particles. The elastic-perfectly plastic model and Tillotson equation of state were employed to predict the dynamic behavior of metal material.

Many studies have explored different supporting structures for RDX; however, the use of natural materials have rarely has been reported. Natural cellulose is widely known for its excellent compatibility and loading capacity. In this study, cellulose was used as a supporting structure and insensitive material for RDX composites. Cellulose/RDX composite aerogels (RCAs) were prepared using 1-allyl-3-methyl imidazole (AMIMCl) as the solvent, and their properties were characterized. The results show that the content of nitrogen in cellulose/RCAs was 34.5%, and the content of RDX was as high as 94.3%. Moreover, RDX particles were attached to the fibers inside the cellulose aerogels (CAs), forming a homogeneous protective layer on the surface of the cellulose matrix. Compared with the raw RDX material, the thermal stability of the cellulose/RDX energetic aerogels was greatly increased. The porosity of the CAs was reduced due to RDX particles growing inside the CAs. The impact sensitivity increased from 35 to 78 cm. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2-s2.0-85097500617"

With the advantages of high efficiency and good stability, a flexible angle beam wedge Rayleigh wave transducer is designed and manufactured. The flexible silicone rubber is utilized as the wedge material (~900 m s–1 of longitudinal wave velocity), which could not only meet the excitation condition of Rayleigh wave, but also make the transducer adequately attached to the curved surface. The transducer exhibits decent performance with good directivity and low attenuation. The experimental results show that the characterization of surface cracks could be realized through experimental analysis of the interaction mechanism between Rayleigh wave and surface cracks. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","2-s2.0-85106862306"

This research examined canine detection proficiency to odor mixtures and the use of mixture training to improve said proficiency. Trained detection canines were tested on their ability to correctly locate their trained target odors, explosives or narcotics, in various mixtures from a series of blanks and distractor odors. After making base measurements, canines were trained on the target odor in mixtures using the Mixed Odor Delivery Device (MODD), which was previously developed to safely contain separated explosive components and deliver the mixed odor to a canine detector for training purposes. Headspace measurements, made using solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS), were also taken of mixture components in and out of the MODD to confirm that odor mixtures were accurately portrayed to the canines during MODD training. Following mixture training, canines were retested on the same mixtures. Results of the headspace analysis showed that the MODD did not alter the delivery of the odorants from the mixture components. As such, canines showed an improved proficiency in detection of target mixtures following mixture training, increasing the detection rate from 63% to 72% for pseudo cocaine mixtures and from 19% to 100% for explosive mixtures. © 2021","2-s2.0-85117746942"

Also, the morphology of ammonium perchlorate particles is an effective parameter in the production of propellants. In the current research, the preparation of ammonium perchlorate using the cooling crystallization method was studied. Four parameters including the rate of cooling, mixing patterns, agitator speed, and surfactant were considered in cooling crystallization of ammonium perchlorate. Nine tests were carried out based on the Taguchi experimental design method. The morphology of the obtained crystals was analyzed by optical microscope and MIP 4 student software. The size distribution of the particles was modeled using the Rosin-Rammler method. Obtained results illustrated that the surfactant had the most effect with the value of 70.7 % and the agitator speed, flow pattern, and cooling rate had fewer effects on the morphology with the values of 25.8 %, 2.9 %, and 0.2 %, respectively. The optimal amount of sphericity obtained by the Taguchi method was 0.77 which was verified by the experimental result of 0.76. The roundness and aspect ratio values for the optimal crystal were 0.79 and 1.40 respectively.

To overcome this issue, the typical approach is the addition of stabilizers to the original formulation of the energetic materials. However, this is not always suitable, particularly if pure materials are needed. Thus, this work presents a new method consisting of capturing the released NOx on activated carbons impregnated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The principle is to perform the oxidation of NOx to HNO3 by photocatalysis in presence of TiO2. Consequently, four different activated carbons are prepared by chemical activation with ZnCl2 and H3PO4 to achieve diverse textural and functional properties. They are subjected to impregnation with 1 wt. % of TiO2. Hence, they are thoroughly characterized by means of nitrogen sorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. Afterwards, their efficiency under different light conditions is assessed through the capture of NOx evolved from the accelerated degradation of nitrocellulose quantified by Bergmann-Junk test. The quantity of captured NOx is determined by ion chromatography. The results show that a combination of a micro and mesoporous material with low surface functions is the optimal criterion to achieve the desired deposition rate of TiO2. This is obtained by the heat-treated activated carbon synthetized using H3PO4. In addition, more than 60% of the released NOx are efficiently captured by the prepared materials under ultraviolet light, corresponding to 0.0723 mmol of NOx per gram of impregnated activated carbon. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85092364607"

They are characterized by their initiating capability, which is a critical factor for their safe and effective use but challenging to assess accurately. In this two-part study, we employ numerical simulations to investigate the blast wave generated by detonators and examine their initiating capability. The first part, presented here, follows the European underwater test of initiating capability, which evaluates detonators in isolation (direct method) and the second part considers detonators placed within a receiving explosive charge (indirect method). In the underwater test, the detonator is ignited inside a water tank and the initiating capability is assessed through pressure measurements in the far field. We employ a multiphysics methodology that allows the use of distinct mathematical models for each component such as two-phase reactive materials, elastic-plastic solids, and inert fluids. The computational implementation is validated against underwater experiments and is employed for the simulation of the blast wave generated by different types of detonators. The initial focus is on the general characteristics of the blast wave and subsequently on the differences between detonators of different shell material and thickness. Results show that the blast wave in the near field is asymmetric and varies significantly between detonators, but these features do not persist in the far field. The underwater test considers only the far field and is thus unable to capture the near field differences, which have a significant impact on the initiation of secondary explosives. © 2021 Author(s).","2-s2.0-85099502337"

The preparation procedure is often simple and generally known, or the information can be looked up on the Internet. The spectrum of phases which can be met concerning these materials is extremely wide and until now no systematic attention has been paid to this fact. In the past years the attention of the Institute of Criminalistics and the University of Pardubice concentrated on preparation of selected groups of these matters, to experimental explosions and to analyses of primary phases and post blast residues using wide spectrum of analytical techniques. Last year the organic analysis was focused on the detection of amines. A simple and sensitive method for the determination of free aliphatic and aromatic amines using derivatives agents as a labelling reagent by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) has been developed. Derivatization conditions including reagent concentration, buffer pH, reaction time and temperature were optimized. A fluorescence derivatization-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, which enables the femtomole-level detection of analytes, is a powerful tool for the analysis with high sensitivity and selectivity. Inorganic microanalysis was concentrated on analysis of post-blast residues from experimental explosions of explosive pyrotechnical compositions based on potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and barium nitrate-fuel.

Chemical analysis of particles and droplets under field conditions is crucial for various tasks carried out by counter-terrorism and law enforcement units. The use of simple, small and low cost means to achieve this goal is constantly pursued. In this work, an approach for rapid, continuous generation of vapors from liquid samples using sonic spray (SS) as the sample introduction technique, followed by analysis using hand-held ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) vapor analyzers is presented. Transfer of analytes is demonstrated from liquid state to the gas phase at the inlet of an IMS detector using a sonic spray apparatus that consists of a nebulizer, spraying solution, a source of compressed gas and an unheated transfer line tube to the detector inlet nozzle. This technique does not require any electrical, radiative or thermal energy. Analysis of several narcotic substances including cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine, and of an explosive compound, TNT, is demonstrated, using two commercial devices as analyzers. Two sampling configurations are presented: direct sampling of liquid, either from a vial or a spill (SS-IMS) and extraction of a substance collected with a swab by dipping it in the spray solvent (ESS-IMS), being suitable for both drops and particles. Limits of detection of the presented method are comparable to those obtained with thermal desorption sample introduction of the commercial device. Time traces of the IMS signals show a continuous and stable signal with a short rise time. This sampling technique may offer competitive performance to that of common thermal desorption techniques, with the advantages of coupling to simpler, smaller and cheaper vapor detectors, optimized for field use, and of a continuous, pulseless sample or object interrogation.

Data from four subsamples from each of the 56 samples produced using “in-house” methods were analyzed using ANOVA to assess the within- and between-sample variation. High within-sample variation was noted; however, ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) tests demonstrated that the between-sample variation was substantially larger than the within-sample variation.

We developed two generations of this laser. The first generation has a high duty cycle and a tunable repetition rate. The second generation is optimized for maximum output power. We utilize these new lasers to measure ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra of many important chromophores that absorb in deep ultraviolet (UV). We demonstrate the utility of this excitation by measuring the 228-nm absolute differential Raman cross sections of explosives, peptides, aromatic amino acids, and DNA/RNA nucleotides. Deep UV excitation at 228 nm occurs within the π → π* electronic transitions of these molecules. The 228-nm resonance excitation enhances the Raman intensities of vibrations of NOx groups, peptide bonds, aromatic amino acid side chains, and DNA/RNA nucleotides. The measured 228-nm UVRR cross sections of these molecules are 103–104 fold greater than those excited in the visible spectral region.

Quantitative information about RDX transformation in coastal ecosystems is essential for management of many of these sites. Isotopically labelled RDX containing 15N in all 3 nitro groups was used to track the fate of RDX in three coastal ecosystem types. Flow-through mesocosms representing subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), subtidal non-vegetated (sand) and intertidal marsh ecosystems were continuously loaded with isotopically labelled RDX for 16–17 days. Sediment, pore-water and overlying surface water were analyzed to determine the distribution of RDX, nitroso-triazine transformation products (NXs) and nitrogen containing complete mineralization products, including ammonium, nitrate+nitrite, nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas. The marsh, silt, and sand ecotypes transformed 94%, 90% and 76% of supplied RDX, respectively. Total dissolved NXs accounted for 2%–4% of the transformed 15N-RDX. The majority of RDX transformation in the water column was by mineralization to inorganic N (dissolved and evaded; 64%–78% of transformed 15N-RDX). RDX was mineralized primarily to N2O (62–74% of transformed 15N-RDX) and secondarily to N2 (1–2% of transformed 15N-RDX) which exchanged with the atmosphere. Transformation of RDX was favored in carbon-rich lower redox potential sediments of the silt and marsh mesocosms where anaerobic processes of iron and sulfate reduction were most prevalent. RDX was most persistent in the carbon-poor sand mesocosm. Partitioning of 15N derived from RDX onto sediment and suspended particulates was negligible in the overall mass balance of RDX transformation (2%–3% of transformed 15N-RDX). The fraction of 15N derived from RDX that was sorbed or assimilated in sediment was largest in the marsh mesocosm (most organic carbon), and smallest in the sand mesocosm (largest grain size and least organic carbon).

Salts of the oxyhalide perchlorate are frequently used as oxidisers in IEDs and in commercially available munitions, thus a reliable detection is needed to aid forensic investigations and the tracing of environmental ground or surface water contamination. We introduce the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a biosensor for the presence of perchlorate, a promising alternative to the costly, technically challenging and time-consuming current perchlorate detection methods. Perchlorate uptake dynamics in C. elegans were first validated using ion exchange chromatography followed by assessing the effects of perchlorate on key life-point indices to verify the suitability of the nematodes as a forensic biosensor. Whole genome microarrays and qPCR analyses established that a set of immune and stress response genes were enriched during perchlorate exposure. A nematode strain (agIs219) containing an integrated copy of the significantly overexpressed t24b8.5 gene promoter followed by a GFP reporter gene was shown to fluoresce in a perchlorate dose dependent manner with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 mg mL-1. Whilst chemicals commonly used in the construction of IEDs did not induce fluorescence, exposure to other oxyhalides did, highlighting the presence of possible shared stress response pathways. Burnt wire sparklers containing potassium perchlorate elicited fluorescence while other non-perchlorate containing post-blast explosion matrices did not. This demonstrates how C. elegans can be used to screen for perchlorate at environmental hotspots, an optimization, possibly with other target transgenes, is required to enable the detection of perchlorate at concentrations below 0.5 mg mL-1.

Its principal uses are as a fertilizer and an explosive. Ammonium nitrate is inherently unstable and has been the cause of numerous accidental explosions, sometimes with hundreds of deaths. We have investigated the thermal decomposition and methods of inhibiting the critical reactions of ammonium nitrate. NOx gas was shown to accumulate during an induction period and lead to the generation of nitrous acid (HNO2). Removal of NOx by adsorption or reduction provides alternative approaches to inhibition. In this work we reveal alternative methods to inhibit accidental ammonium nitrate explosions. Layered double hydroxides, such as hydrotalcite, were found to be very effective at inhibiting and delaying detonation by adsorbing NOx. Urea, traditionally used to inhibit explosions, was found to be very ineffective at higher temperatures (above ∼ 80 °C). However, the addition of MnO2 catalysts to urea increased its efficiency at temperatures up to ∼ 130 °C.

Training a computer to identify the hazardous items from DECT scans however implies training on a baggage dataset that can represent all the possible ways a threat item can packed inside a bag. Practically, however, generating such data is made challenging by the logistics (and the permissions) related to the handling of the hazardous materials. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to present a software simulation pipeline that eliminates the need for a human to handle dangerous materials and that allows for virtually unlimited variability in the placement of such materials in a bag alongside benign materials. METHODS: In this paper, we present our DEBISim software pipeline that carries out an end-to-end simulation of a DECT scanner for virtual bags. The key highlights of DEBISim are: (i) A 3D user-interactive graphics editor for constructing a virtual 3D bag with manual placement of different types of objects in it; (ii) An automated virtual bag generation algorithm for creating randomized baggage datasets; (iii) An ability to spawn deformable sheets and liquid-filled containers in a virtual bag to represent plasticized and liquid explosives; and (iv) A GPU-based X-ray forward modelling block for spiral cone-beam scanners used in checked baggage screening. RESULTS: We have tested our simulator using two standard CT phantoms: the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom and the NIST security screening phantom as well as on a set of reference materials representing commonly encountered items in checked baggage. For these phantoms, we have assessed the quality of the simulator by comparing the simulated data reconstructions with real CT scans of the same phantoms. The comparison shows that the material-specific properties as well as the CT artifacts in the scans generated by DEBISim are close to those produced by an actual scanner. CONCLUSION: DEBISim is an end-to-end simulation framework for rapidly generating X-ray baggage data for dual energy cone-beam scanners.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85102586324"

A tunable mid-IR Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) and a CW fixed wavelength visible laser have been used as the pump and probe beam respectively. The developed Photothermal (PT) technique is based on Quartz Tuning Fork (QTF) detector for the detection of hazardous/explosive molecules adsorbed on plastic surface and also in aerosols form. PT spectra of various trace molecules in the fingerprinting mid- infrared spectral band 7–9 µm from distance of 25 m have been recorded. The PT spectra of explosives RDX, TNT and Acetone have been recorded at very low quantities. Acetone is the precursor of explosive Tri-Acetone Tri-Phosphate (TATP). The experimentations using pump and probe lasers, exhibit detection sensitivity of less than 5 μg/cm2 for RDX, TNT powders and of ~ 200 nl quantity for Nitrobenzene (NB) and Acetone (in liquid form) adsorbed on surfaces, from a distance of ~ 25 m. The sensitivity of the same order achieved from a distance of 15 m by using only a mid-IR tunable pump laser coupled to QTF detector. Thus the pump-probe PT technique is more sensitive in comparison to single tunable QCL pump beam technique and it is better suited for standoff detection of hazardous chemicals for homeland security as well as for forensic applications. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85090875849"

It was established that the TNDA decomposition (kliq=3.1 ⋅ 1021⋅exp(−26865/T), Ea=223.4 kJ mol−1) is accompanied by strong autocatalysis (kcat=9.8 ⋅ 1014⋅exp(-18056/T), Ea=150.2 kJ mol−1). The mechanism of autocatalysis was proposed. The essence of autocatalysis is the oxidation of TNDA by decomposition products, followed by the destruction of the molecule. An unusual feature of this autocatalysis is that, in contrast to autocatalysis of nitroesters, the process does not disappear at high temperatures, but rather determines the kinetics of heat release in the combustion wave. The surface temperature and combustion mechanism of TNDA were established through thermocouple studies.

In addition to generating specific VUV spectra for each compound, VUV was used to indicate the onset of thermal decomposition based upon the appearance of break-down products such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, water, and molecular oxygen. The effect of temperature on decomposition could be fit to a logistical function where the fraction of intact compound remaining decreased as the transfer line/flow cell temperature was increased from 200 °C to 300 °C. Utilizing this relationship, the decomposition temperatures for the nitrate ester and nitramine compounds were determined to range between 244 °C and 277 °C. It was also discovered that the decomposition temperature was dependent on the GC carrier gas flow rate and, therefore, the residence time of the compounds in the transfer line/flow cell. For example, the measured decomposition temperature of nitroglycerine ranged from 222 °C to 253 °C across four flow rates. Tracking the appearance/disappearance of decomposition products across this temperature range indicated that NO, CO, and H2CO are final decomposition products while O2 and H2O are intermediate products. The decomposition temperatures for all explosives were highly correlated to similar decomposition measurements taken by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (r = 0.91) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (r = 0.90–0.98).

In this configuration, a steady propagating detonation will develop, sweeping around the arc with constant angular speed. We report on results from three PBX 9501 arc experiments, exploring the variation in linear speed on the inner and outer arc surfaces for the steady wave along with the structure of the curved detonation front, as a function of varying inner surface radius and arc thickness. Comparisons of the properties of the motion of the steady wave for each arc configuration are then made with a spatially-distributed PBX 9501 reactive burn model, calibrated to detonation performance properties in a 2D planar slab geometry. We show that geometry-induced curvature of the detonation near the inner arc surface has a significant effect on the detonation motion even for conventional high explosives. We also examine the detonation driving zone structure for each arc case, and thus the subsonic regions of the flow that determine the influence of the arc geometry on the detonation propagation. In addition, streamline paths and reaction progress isolines are calculated. We conclude that a common approximation for modeling conventional high explosive detonation, wherein the shock-normal detonation speed is assumed equal to the Chapman-Jouguet speed, can lead to significant errors in describing the speed at which the detonation propagates. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-85090268004"

The effects of aluminum particles on the afterburning reaction and explosive performance are obtained by changing the size of the particles and the gas environment. The results show that the concentration of oxygen in air is not sufficient to support complete combustion of aluminum particles. The estimated oxidation rate of aluminum particles is 87–93%, and it tends to decrease with increasing particle size. Part of aluminum particles oxidize with detonation products, and the reaction can last for hundreds of microseconds. However, the degree of oxidation between the large-sized aluminum particles and detonation products is small. A new method is used to estimate the initial energy of detonation by observing the time difference between sensing the initial light and the pressure wave. This method leads to a conclusion that some of the aluminum particles are oxidized during detonation and provide additional energy to the primary blast wave.

These experimental results test the conventional assumption of axisymmetric, effective one-dimensional burning. Polycarbonate confinement tubes allowed this direct imaging with steel spheres employed as radio-opaque fiducials. Spheres embedded in the explosive column revealed the displacement of the explosive prior to deflagration. X-ray and fast camera images show that a dense plug of compact explosive develops ahead of the deflagration front. The internal fiducials register both internal changes in the plug and changes in the position between successive x-ray images. Tantalum witness strips placed on the inner wall of the explosive channel revealed radial expansion of the tube bore at successive x-ray exposures, indicating the internal pressure of about 100 MPa just before detonation. Images indicate that the deflagration is not only asymmetric but also involves newly observed transient phenomena just before detonation. We typically see a brief but continuous increase in deflagration speed and the formation of a deflagration channel that bypasses the plug just prior to detonation.

This blue discoloration has been observed since the formulation development of PBX 9404 in the late 1950s. In order to determine the source of the blue discoloration in PBX 9404, ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorbance of PBX 9404 and two potential candidates for the discoloration, p-nitrosodiphenylamine (p-NDPA) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (N-NDPA) were evaluated. An absorbance band at 590 nm in PBX 9404 sample was attributed to the blue discoloration while p-NDPA and N-NPDA had different absorbance bands. Using the knowledge gained from the UV/Vis analysis, a semi-targeted approach using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography coupled to UV/Vis detector and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UV/Vis-QTOF) was implemented. Investigating the UHPLC-UV/Vis-QTOF chromatograms at a wavelength of 590 nm, a single compound was tentatively identified as being the source of the blue discoloration. Targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on the compound and subsequent analysis indicated that 4,4′-{[4-(Phenylimino)-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]methylene}bis(N-phenylaniline), also known as Spirit Blue Base, was the source of the blue discoloration, which was confirmed using a standard.

This phenomena is observed for the explosive PBX 9502 (95 wt% TATB) both for planar and oblique input shocks. In this work, we build on previous results by performing cylinder expansion (CYLEX) tests where the explosive charge is comprised of a faster core of PBX 9501 (95 wt% HMX) inside a slower annulus of PBX 9502. The detonation in the faster PBX 9501 drives an oblique shock into the adjacent PBX 9502, and an annular transverse initiating layer (IL) results. In the test geometry, the IL travels steadily down the length of the test after a short run distance. At radial positions beyond the IL, an annular region of detonating PBX 9502 is observed. Using standard CYLEX test diagnostics, we infer the total energy release of this experiment. By making the assumptions that (1) the combined energy release is comprised of contributions from detonating PBX 9501, detonating PBX 9502, and the IL in the PBX 9502 and (2) mass-specific energy release for the detonating explosives is approximately the same as typically observed for each explosive, the IL energy release and reaction efficiency can be computed. Results are compared to prior results for a similar geometry, and indicate that while shock deadened PBX 9502 does not detonate promptly, it does eventually release a significant portion of its chemical potential energy over longer timescales on the order of 10 μs. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-85096486529"

Such an objective stems from the problem of trace explosive detection by techniques based on explosive vapor recording. In particular, we have previously devised an instrumentation system for standoff trace explosive detection by the active spectral imaging method. To determine the applicability limits of remote trace explosive detection methods, one should understand the regularities of evaporation dynamics of an explosive thin film, depending on explosive properties, film geometry (thickness, surface area), and ambient conditions. The mathematical model relies on the Hertz-Knudsen- Langmuir equation for evaporation rate and allows for heat exchange between the surface and ambient gas and for heat loss due to evaporation. The fact that phase transition temperature in a thin film is lower than that in a large volume of an explosive was also taken into account. The parametric study of the model was performed. The basic parameters and their variation range affecting the film evaporation rate were identified.

This study demonstrates the ability to control crystal orientation and porosity in pentaerythritol tetranitrate films by varying the interfacial energy between the substrate and the vapor-deposited explosive. Variation in density, porosity, surface roughness, and optical properties is achieved in the explosive film, with significant implications for initiation sensitivity and detonation performance of the explosive material. Various surface science techniques, including angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and multiliquid contact angle analysis, are utilized to characterize interfacial characteristics between the substrate and explosive film. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of pentaerythritol tetranitrate surfaces and fracture cross sections illustrate the difference in morphology evolution and the microstructure achieved through surface energy modification. X-ray diffraction studies with the Tilt-A-Whirl three-dimensional pole figure rendering and texture analysis software suite reveal that high surface energy substrates result in a preferred (110) out-of-plane orientation of pentaerythritol tetranitrate crystallites and denser films. Low surface energy substrates create more randomly textured pentaerythritol tetranitrate and lead to nanoscale porosity and lower density films. This work furthers the scientific basis for interfacial engineering of polycrystalline organic explosive films through control of surface energy, enabling future study of dynamic and reactive detonative phenomena at the microscale.

To determine the possible influence of water addition on pyrotechnic deterioration, this study estimates the degree of thermal hazard of pyrotechnic based on the analysis of heat release, reaction kinetics, and the heat exchange model of pyrotechnic deterioration. The explosion sound (ES) firecracker was used to analyze the thermal hazard and mixed water (ES + W) to simulate the dampness condition using differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic equations simulating thermal hazard safety parameters, combined with thermokinetic and thermal runaway data results, were used to discuss the safety and potential thermal hazard characteristics of ES, as the safety of fireworks in storage, transportation, process conditions, and operation assessment to curtail the probability of accidents. The results showed that if the initial exothermic temperature of ES + W is higher than ES, a thermal decomposition reaction will occur at a lower temperature, and the exothermic heat rises and the apparent activation energy decreases, indicating that the ES will increase its instability after being damp. The presence of water degenerated the ES and resulted in a violent reaction during the release process to explode the ES, which increased the chance of accidents among the onlookers. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85100665505"

The modeling approach is based on simplified idealizations of PBX microstructure including RDX grains and estane binder regions subjected to velocity boundary conditions representative of impact conditions in situ. The constitutive description of the microstructure constituents includes a dislocation-based, anisotropic, single crystal plasticity model for the explosive grains and a linear viscoelastic model to represent the estane binder. Large suites of simulations were used to systematically study the correlation in heating of the grains with local wave dynamics, crystal orientation, and the microstructural neighborhood. These correlations were identified through the selection of characteristics of crystal anisotropy including oriented wave speeds and Taylor factor. A key observation is that the wave dispersion within a certain distance from the impact interface plays a dominant role in the temperature field. Beyond this distance, individual crystal orientations play a more dominant role, but cannot entirely account for the observed heterogeneity without consideration of the local microstructure neighborhood. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","2-s2.0-85100905598"

Generally it works as an effective sensing medium for the detection of explosives when mixed in an equal proportion and are subjected to 532 nm wavelength without any chemical treatment [1]. The pristine PEDOT is less sensitive to 532 nm wavelength (2.33 eV) but influences the Raman S and AS lines of explosives in the mixture. The study also reveals that a small quantity (one milligram) of PEDOT is sufficient to initiate the positive charge transfer mechanism between its oxidized state to the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms of the nitro group of the explosive molecules. Consequently, the intensity of the Raman spectra of RDX, HMX and TNT is dropped by an order of 22.5, 11.45 and 17.2 times, respectively along with the shift of the NO2 vibrational modes. It is also attributed to Photon-electron–phonon interaction.

The maximum flyer velocity of a thermally ignited detonator was comparable in magnitude to that obtained by initiating a room temperature pristine detonator with an exploding bridge wire (under the same confinement); however, the high flyer velocity was not an indication of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in the thermally ignited detonator.

The explosive pellets were impacted by thin aluminum impactors supported by low-impedance polymers, thereby subjecting the pellets to short duration shocks. Impact conditions were used to determine impact tilt, pulse pressure and duration, sample transit time, and whether or not a detonation occurred. Exploding Foil Initiator (EFI) launchers were used as a baseline for evaluating the technique, and it was found that the present technique addresses multiple shortcomings of EFI-based systems. The aluminum foil allowed impacts with pressure durations of 70–80 ns, resulting in input conditions closely matching those of EFI-based systems. The thicker aluminum plate impactors resulted in pulse durations of approximately 600 ns and allowed access to a previously inaccessible region of the initiation curve. Initiation thresholds were bracketed using both impactors, and the data is compared with complementary initiation data from EFI-based systems with good agreement. Based on the results and closely related work, a novel, physically-based criterion is proposed to allow the initiation curve to be predicted based on the explosive's unreacted equation of state and sustained-pulse, shock-to-detonation run distance (the “Pop-plot”), giving a physical basis for previously published observations. Finally, the criterion is applied to the data available to propose a relationship between pressure, pulse duration, and run distance, suggesting that input pulse durations of 50–100 % higher than the critical condition should be applied to approximate the run distance of a sustained pulse. © Published 2020.

Opening a package without knowledge of its contents and the resulting hazards is highly involved with risks and should be avoided whenever possible. Therefore, preferable methods work non-destructive with minimal interaction and are capable of identifying target substances in a containment quickly and reliably. Most spectroscopic methods find their limits, if the target substance is shielded by a covering material. To solve this problem, a combined laser drilling method with subsequent identification of the target substance by means of Raman spectroscopic measurements through microscopic bore holes of the covering material is presented. A pulsed laser beam is used for both the drilling process and as an excitation source for Raman measurements in the same optical setup. Results show the ability of this new method to gain high-quality spectra even when performed through microscopic small bore channels. With the laser parameters chosen right, the method can even be performed on highly sensitive explosives like triacetone triperoxide (TATP). Another advantageous effect arises in an observed reduction in unwanted fluorescence signal in the spectral data, resulting from the confocal-like measurement setup with the bore hole acting as aperture. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85104759449"

Empirical and numerical models that were developed to estimate structural capacity are reviewed. The structural idealization, theoretical basis, and merits of various methods are also described. The influence of various parameters affecting the structural performance is discussed. Findings: The material of the paper captures recent engineering developments that can be used by practitioners for blast analysis and design for industrial and residential buildings. Little emphasis was given in the published literature to develop simplified analytical models that can be used in practice to compute the dynamic response of buildings subject to accidental explosions. Furthermore, analytical expressions are required to compute the reduction in the stiffness due to impact loading. Originality/value: Current building codes address conventional live, dead, wind and earthquake loads. Very few guidelines are available in practice for design of buildings subject to blast loading.

A complicated afterburning reaction occurs in the internal explosion of aluminized explosives, not only enhancing the intensity of the shock wave, but also having a great influence on the final quasi-static pressure. A theoretical calculation model of final quasi-static pressure for aluminized explosive in confined space considering afterburning effect was proposed, based on the analysis of chemical reaction, the law of conservation of energy and the improved Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state. The factor that the volume of gaseous explosive products decreases in the afterburning reaction was also taken into consideration. The results of RDX-based and HMX-based charges calculated by the model were then analyzed and compared with the references’ experimental results as well as Anderson’s empirical formulas’ to verify the reliability and correctness of the proposed model. The results show that: the final quasi-static pressure of aluminized explosive calculated by the theoretical calculation model is in good agreement with the results of experimental measurement in the papers and the relative error doesn’t exceed 10%; the Anderson’s empirical formula is inapplicable to predict the final quasi-static pressure of the aluminized explosive in confined space. The study in this paper can provide a better theoretical calculation model to predict the final quasi-static pressure of aluminized explosives and provide some reference and guidance for the assessment of internal explosion damage of aluminized explosive and the design of explosive-resistant structures. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis (GEMBE), a robust electrokinetic separation technique, was employed for the separation and detection of common inorganic oxidizers from frequently encountered fuel-oxidizer mixtures. The GEMBE system incorporated sample and run buffer reservoirs, a short capillary (5 cm), an applied electric field, and a pressure-driven counterflow. GEMBE provided a separation format that allowed for continuous injection of sample, selectivity of analytes, and no sample cleanup or filtration prior to analysis. Nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate oxidizers were successfully detected from low explosive propellants (e.g., black powders and black powder substitutes), pyrotechnics (e.g., flash powder), and tertiary explosive mixtures (e.g., ammonium nitrate- and potassium chlorate-based fuel-oxidizer mixtures). Separation of these mixtures exhibited detection without interference from a plethora of additional organic and inorganic fuels, enabled single particle analysis, and demonstrated semiquantitative capabilities. The bulk counterflow successfully excluded difficult components from fouling the capillary, yielding estimated limits of detection down to approximately 10 μmol/L.

Canine detectors are often touted as having lower limits of detection, or olfactory detection threshold (ODT), than other field-relevant detection technologies; however, previous attempts to quantify canine ODTs have resulted in reported estimates spanning multiple orders of magnitude, even for the same analyte. A major contributor to these discrepancies is the vapor delivery method used for testing, where losses due to adsorption and dilution are often unaccounted for, and the presence of unattended compounds in the vapor stream due to carryover may go unnoticed. In this research, a trace vapor generator (TV-Gen) was used to deliver quantitatively accurate amounts of vapor reproducibly over time for canine testing. Analyte losses due to adsorption to surfaces in the flow path, dilution in the sniff port at the outlet, and analyte carryover were considered. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling was used to visualize analyte vapor spread throughout the port. CFD simulations revealed the need for a diffuser to encourage the diffusion of the analyte throughout the port. As a result, the modified vapor generator provides analyte air as a diffuse flow that is evenly distributed through the custom sampling orifice, as opposed to a narrow stream of air at the chosen concentration which exits directly into the environment. Laboratory validations were carried out for three analytes, amyl acetate, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and methyl benzoate. A linear response across more than two orders of magnitude vapor concentration range was achieved for all analytes. These efforts will be applied in further research utilizing this TV-Gen vapor delivery system for canine ODT testing, eliminating many quantitative changes seen previously.

The detection of post-blast high explosives in the Israel Police laboratory is usually performed by extracting the exhibits with organic solvents (mainly acetone) and after evaporation of most of the solvent, injecting the concentrated liquid into a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument for analysis.

However, it is unclear about the photostability and degradation pathways of TKX-50 in aqueous solution. In this paper, the photostability and the degradation process of TKX-50 in aqueous solution have been comprehensively studied for the first time. TKX-50 can keep stable toward visible light. However, it presented a rapid degradation with rate constant of 0.0054 s−1 under 254-nm light irradiation. TKX-50 also demonstrated much faster photodegradation than traditional nitro explosives. Further, degradation products of TKX-50 were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrum with theoretical calculations. The photodegradation pathways are proposed that 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (BTO) anion of TKX-50 can been fragmented into the nitrile by losing N2 and HNO, and then hydroxylammonium (NH3OH+) from TKX-50 reacts with the nitrile through the nucleophilic addition. Besides as a solvent, water also may accelerate the photodegradation of TKX-50 probably by hydrolyzing the intermediary nitrile products. In a word, this study provides comprehensive understanding about the photostability of TKX-50 in aqueous solution, and it is helpful to study the photochemistry of other energetic ionic salts based on BTO. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85101042171"

The presence of UXO and the release of their chemical compounds can be of environmental concern. The complete and incomplete detonation of explosives can ignite vegetation fires that cause organics in the topsoil to burn, and therefore, impact the environmental fate of these compounds. The sorption and transport of two UXOs, HMX and RDX, were investigated in a surface soil that was previously exposed to a fire event. In addition, a control soil that had not been exposed to a fire event was used. The use of burned and unburned soil to simulate soil that has been directly impacted by the explosion of UXOs combined with the uniqueness of the soil properties in Hawaii represents the novelty of this study. The surface soil that had been previously exposed to a fire event showed greater adsorption than the control, which was possibly due to a reduction of macropores in the burned soil and the presence of fine charcoal particles. Regardless of the presence or absence of a fire event, HMX showed a greater sorption affinity than RDX. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2-s2.0-85094200261"

Thus, it became the need of today’s era to understand the basics of explosion and factors affecting the explosion. Types of explosives are one of the important parameters which directly influences the impact of blast on any structural element. The term “TNT equivalence” is considered as the benchmark and is most commonly used to compare the performance of explosives with respect to reference explosive, i.e. trinitrotoluene (TNT). The main purpose of this study is to review TNT equivalence and the factors associated with it. The effect of charge geometry (i.e. spherical, flat, cylindrical, square etc.), confinement (close-in, intermediate or far ranges, etc.) and standoff distance on the peak overpressure and impulse are discussed in the present study as explosive energy and charge mass of the detonating material is related to equivalent weight of TNT. Moreover, effect of scaled distance of high explosives on TNT equivalent is also presented. Further, various numerical methods used to compute the TNT equivalents (TNTe) are reported for improved understanding of the TNT equivalence. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85097648131"

The charges are comprised of gelled nitromethane with uniformly embedded aluminum, magnesium, or glass particles. Particle sizes are varied over an order of magnitude with particle mass fractions up to 50%. Peak blast overpressures are directly measured within the fireball with piezoelectric pressure gauges and outside the fireball are inferred by tracking the velocity of the blast wave and using the Rankine–Hugoniot relation. With the addition of inert particles, the peak blast overpressure is initially mitigated, but then recovers in the far field. For charges with reactive particles, the particles react promptly with oxidizers in the detonation products and release energy as early as within the first few hundred microseconds in all cases. The particle energy release enhances the peak blast overpressures in the far field by up to twice the values for a constant volume charge of the baseline homogenous explosive. By plotting the peak blast overpressure decay as a function of energy-scaled distance, it is inferred that at least half of the particle energy release contributes to the blast overpressure in the far field of higher mass loadings, and nearly all of the particle energy for a particle mass fraction of 10%. For aluminum, the blast augmentation is not a systematic function of particle size. This observation implies that conventional models for particle combustion that depend on particle surface area are not appropriate for describing the rapid aluminum reaction that occurs in the extreme conditions within the detonation products, which influences the blast wave propagation. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85105437726"

TATP is an energetic material commonly used by terrorists in improvised explosive devices both as the initiator and the energetic material itself. TATP is still going largely undetected in many densely populated venues such as train stations and airports. No electronic trace detection system currently exists that is capable of continuously monitoring TATP, or its precursors, in the vapor phase. Recently, we developed a thermodynamic sensor that can detect TATP and other nitrogen-based explosives in the vapor phase at the ppb level. These ultrathin sensors showed unparalleled sensitivity and could even be operated at low enough powers to enable them to be deployed on drones. The sensor relies on specific oxidation-reduction reactions between the energetic molecules and metal oxide catalysts. Here, catalyst coated microheaters measure the heat effects associated with redox reactions occurring on the surface of the metal oxide catalyst. Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were achieved through implementation of ultrathin ( $8~\mu \text{m}$ thick) yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) as the substrate for the sensor platform. This reduction in the thermal mass combined with the catalytic amplification associated with Pd microheaters and optimized catalyst porosity enabled us to detect TATP in the vapor phase at unprecedented levels.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85096216246"

It can be crucial for investigating acts of terrorism or robberies. Ion Chromatography (IC) is a standard technique used by many forensic labs in these cases. Due to the common nature of many explosives and the inherent dirtiness of samples from explosion scenes, sometimes inconclusive or false positive results are obtained by IC, making the identification of interferers extremely important. One possible source of interferer can be the sampling materials themselves, as investigated in this work. First of all, interferers from forensic swabs and syringe filters were evaluated, as these are commonly employed in explosive residue IC analysis. Among the 6 tested samples, only two syringe filters were considered free of interferers. Significant amounts (>0.2 mg/L) of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, and SO4 2- were found in all forensic swabs and two syringe filters. Then, some ordinary commercial materials, such as cotton swabs, cotton balls, and cotton discs were also tested, as they are often employed in a forensic routine, also. These also showed significant amounts (>0.2 mg/L) of Na+, K+, Cl−, NO3 −, and SO4 2-. However, the total concentration of interferers in ordinary commercial materials was lower than in the forensic swabs. Then the effectiveness of removing interferers by washing sampling (swabs, and cotton balls, rolls and disk) and pre-processing (syringe filters) materials was evaluated. This revealed that the interferers could be removed with at least three washes. The results indicated that the sampling materials used for explosion scene analysis should be carefully addressed in forensic analysis. First, by making a previous analysis of the sampling material, preferably prior to use, to evaluate the presence of interferers to ensure that only material free of interferers is used. When it is not possible to perform a prior analysis of sampling materials, they should be analyzed concomitantly with the samples from the post-blast residue in order to estimate the presence of interferers. This would reduce the risk of false positives. Additionally, when interferers are detected, washing can be employed for more reliable routine analysis. We suggest at least 3 wash cycles. This method could be used for ordinary commercial materials, which are cheap and easily obtained. © 2019","2-s2.0-85076359103"

Thin films are a commonly used tool for investigating the fundamental crystallization behavior in many systems, and the interfacial physics between a crystallizing species and the substrate can significantly affect many factors associated with the crystal growth process. In this work, atmospheric vapor deposition was used to prepare thin films of supercooled PETN droplets on the surfaces of copper, gold, and silicon. The gold and copper surfaces were prepared on silicon substrates using ultra-high vacuum vapor deposition. Crystallization of the supercooled PETN droplets was induced by scanning the surface of each substrate type with an atomic force microscope upon which crystallization occurred in the form of compact, circularly shaped dendrites reminiscent of spherulites. All three substrates were characterized relative to their respective surface roughness and surface energy. The surface energy was assessed from contact angle measurements with three liquids: water, ethylene glycol, and dodecane. High-resolution, time-lapse images of the crystal growth process were acquired under high magnification on each material surface, and the crystal growth rates were measured based on the radial distance of “ring” features that appeared in the crystal growth patterns after inducing changes in the substrate temperature.

This is particularly important for nuclear explosion monitoring, as any future clandestine tests will likely be underground.

For the lidar collections, we used a terrestrial lidar scanner to obtain high-resolution point clouds and create digital elevation models (DEMs). For the imagery collections, we used structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and a dense grid of surveyed ground control points to create high-resolution DEMs. Comparisons between the pre- and post-experiment DEMs indicate changes in surface topography that vary between explosive experiments with varying yield and depth parameters. Our work shows that the relationship between explosive yield and the extent of observable surface change differs from the standard scaled-depth-of-burial model.

The microcapsules were spherical and could encapsulate the thickening agent effectively, and the viscosity of the emulsion matrix with 2 mass % of them was close to that of the reference emulsion matrix at ca. 127.9 Pa s. Experimental results of TG-DSC and detonation performance showed that the novel underground mining emulsion explosive had a good thermal stability and its detonation velocity was 5133 m s−1 and still up to 4618 m s−1 after storing at the temperature of −20 °C for 12 h. The novel underground mining emulsion explosive with thickening microcapsules not only achieved the goal of thickening in the blast holes, but also had excellent detonation performance and low-temperature resistance capability. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This family of instrumental techniques has attracted curiosity from the field of forensic science due to its desirable properties such as rapid collection of information-rich data, combined with minimal requirements for sample mass and preparation. Experiments were conducted with a ""Direct Sample Analysis"" ion source integrated with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The ionization behaviors of nitroglycerin, methyl and ethyl centralite, akardite, diphenylamine, nitrosodiphenylamine, and nitrated diphenylamine derivatives were investigated specifically, with accurate-mass data presented for each. Diphenylamine standards were used to demonstrate the performance of this instrument, which exhibited good response linearity across 1 order of magnitude and sub-nanogram detection limits. Thirty smokeless powder extracts, recovered from ammunition potentially in circulation within Australia, were analyzed to determine whether the technique is appropriate for rapid analysis of smokeless powder particles. Results demonstrated that the technique might be applied to compare individual particles with each other or to a database. Such a capability may be of value in the examination of explosive devices containing smokeless powder, postblast residues therefrom, or muzzle discharge from a close-range shooting. However, when efforts were made to detect residues from the hands of a volunteer shooter, only some returned positive results, and a high background signal from the sample collection stub indicates that detection using this instrument is thus far insufficiently reliable. © 2020 Springer New York LLC.

In current sampling techniques, the collection efficiency of post-blast residue is highly variable and often dependent on the swabbing materials and solvent systems used. To address these method limitations, this study presents a gelatine-based sampling medium and assesses its capabilities for the collection of ammonium nitrate. Common surfaces were spotted with a known concentration of ammonium nitrate, the unset gel applied, allowed to set, and then peeled from the surface. The gel was dissolved, and solid phase extraction employed to isolate the target explosive compound and remove the constituents of the gel. The eluate was concentrated and subsequently analysed and quantified. Overall, the gel formulation was able to collect ammonium nitrate from all of the test surfaces, with recoveries ranging from 0.1% to 61.7%. This study presents a gelatine-based formulation that has the potential to become a valuable asset in the forensic tool kit for the collection of explosive traces. A key attribute of the gel is that it offers an alternative recovery tool to conventional swabbing and solvent extraction methods. © 2020 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","2-s2.0-85089081652"

Preconcentration of the analyte is a useful technique to lower the detection limit of existing sensors. A nanoporous silica (pSiO2) substrate was evaluated as a preconcentrator for gas-phase 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB), a volatile detection taggant added by law to plastic explosives. After collection in pSiO2, the DMNB vapor was thermally desorbed at 70 °C into a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry sorbent tube. This was analyzed for the total mass of DMNB collected in pSiO2. The loading time and loading temperature of pSiO2 were varied systematically between 15 and 60 min and 5-20 °C, respectively. The preconcentrator's performance was compared to that of a nonporous substrate of the same material as a control. The collection efficiency of pSiO2 was calculated as approximately 20% of the total DMNB that passed over it in 30 min, at a concentration of 0.5 ppm in N2 carrier gas. It had enhancement factors compared to the nonporous substrate of 12 and 16 for 0.5 and 4.1 ppm DMNB, respectively, under the same conditions. No advantage was found with cooling pSiO2 below room temperature during the loading phase, which removes any need for a cooling system to aid preconcentration. The low desorption temperature of 70 °C is an advantage over other preconcentration systems, although a higher temperature could decrease the desorption time.

First, acid pyrolysis with ultrasonic hydrothermal co-cutting breaks down the coarse graphite into nanometric graphene sheets (GS) and graphene oxide sheets (GOS) with oxygen-rich functionalities. These functionalities were then used to break GOS into graphene oxide nanofibers (GONFs) and graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs). Finally, upon reduction, GOQDs lose oxygen linkages to produce fluorescent GQDs (quantum yield up to 27%). The as-developed GQDs were characterized with detailed optical and spectral studies through UV, PL, FTIR, TEM, AFM, XPS, XRD and other techniques. Notably, the synthesized GQDs were catalytically active to serve as a ratiometric fluorescence switch on-off probe for the reduction of toxic nitrophenols. Moreover, the GQDs detected nitrophenol derivatives at lower concentrations than previously reported analytical values. During the real sample analysis of spiked industrial water and exposed soil samples, a high selectivity and sensitivity of the applied method was achieved with a recovery of 99.7% to 101.3% at spiked concentrations of 400 nM to 100 nM, respectively.

Two independent investigations are reported here. First, gas permeametry and dynamic pycnometry techniques were used to measure the molecular flow (Knudsen) coefficient and the internally interconnected void fraction of pristine and thermally damaged samples in two uniaxial pressing orientations. The permeability of PBX 9502 was found to be unmeasurably low (of the same order of magnitude as PTFE) with gas transport being diffusion-dominated. Secondly, a pressure vessel experiment was developed to measure quasi-static and dynamic gas generation as the explosive was heated to self-ignition (cookoff). The gas generation results and the permeability/diffusivity findings provide evidence that PBX 9502 remains impermeable until seconds prior to self-ignition. At ignition, internal void-pressure drives macro-scale cracking and the sample becomes uniformly incorporated in the following deconsolidating deflagration.

Besides, supersolubility as well as the metastable zone width of TKX-55 in PDO, BA, DMSO and IBA was determined by the dynamic laser monitoring method. The experimental results showed that the solubility of TKX-55 in fourteen pure solvents increases with increasing temperature and the metastable zone width decreases with increasing temperature. The metastable zone width is approximately 2.49 K–43.26 K. In addition, in order to improve the applicability of the solubility, the modified Apelblat equation, λh equation, the polynomial empirical equation, van't Hoff equation and NRTL equation were used to correlate the solubility data of TKX-55, and the results showed that all models can give a satisfactory correlation. The average root-mean-square deviation (102RMSD) values were 1.71, 8.91, 2.33, 6.12 and 3.30, respectively. Moreover, Hansen solubility parameter was used for explaining the solubility order of TKX-55 in selected solvents, the consequences showed that solubility order of TKX-55 resulted from the comprehensive function of several solubility parameters. The solubility parameter of Δδt between TKX-55 and solvents reached from 1.27 MPa0.5 to 15.28 MPa0.5. Furthermore, three kinds of thermodynamic properties of the mixing enthalpy (ΔmixH), the mixing entropy (ΔmixS) and the mixing Gibbs energy (ΔmixG) of TKX-55 in selected solvents were calculated by NRTL equation and the results turned out that the dissolution process was spontaneous. Besides, thermal properties of TKX-55 were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the melting temperature and the fusion enthalpy were 640.65 K and 19.60 kJ·mol−1, respectively.

As sparkler residue would be encountered in cases involving these types of devices, the characterisation and source determination of the residue would be beneficial within a forensic investigation. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the potential of using trace elemental profiling coupled with chemometric and other statistical techniques to link a variety of different sparklers to their origin. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentration of 50 elements in 48 pre-blast sparkler samples from eight sparkler brands/classes available in Australia. Extracting ground-up sparkler residue in 10% nitric acid for 24 hours was found to give the most reliable quantification. The collected data were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualise the distribution of the sample data and explore whether the sparkler samples could be classified into their respective brands. ANOVA based feature selection was used to remove elements that did not largely contribute to the separation between classes. This resulted in the development of a 7-elemental profile, consisting of V, Co, Ni, Sr, Sn, Sb, W, which could be used to correctly classify the samples into eight distinct groups. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was subsequently used to construct a discriminant model using four out of six samples from each class. The model successfully classified 100% of the samples to their correct sparkler brand. The model also correctly matched 100% of the remaining samples to the correct class.

The RDX suspension did not completely dissolve, even as temperatures approached ignition. Our results contrast with published measurements of RDX solubility in hot TNT that suggest RDX would be completely dissolved at these high temperatures.

Data from aquarium experiments is often used for calibration of reactive burn models based on phenomenological equations of state (EOS) and reaction rate laws. This paper presents a multimaterial numerical modeling framework to solve the 2D axisymmetric reactive Euler equations for high-explosive aquarium tests, in particular for ammonium nitrate - fuel oil (ANFO) explosives. An extension of the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) is used to handle the dynamic material interfaces for the ANFO explosion products, the charge-confining material (polymethyl methacrylate PMMA), and the surrounding water. This study analyzes the sensitivity of calculations (both computational efficiency and numerical accuracy) to different algorithms for the material interface models including the original GFM versus Riemann solver-based strategies. A novel method for defining the left and right states in the interfacial Riemann problem eliminates the need for sorting or nodal interpolation during the projection along the material interface. Numerical tests indicate that populating the interface node values using the Riemann solution mitigate the overheating error observed in steady-state calculations. Solution convergence and computational efficiency are explored as a function of the spatial and temporal order of the schemes. Results from the computational model with analytical equations of state and fitted reaction rate parameters show very good quantitative agreement with experimentally observed detonation front velocity, reaction products expansion, and shock wave propagation in the surrounding water for a cylindrical ANFO charge encased in PMMA.

Such adsorbents combine characteristics of nonpolar carbon phase and polar inorganic matrix. Both porosity and texture of composites substantially depend on applied carbon precursor, inorganic component and pyrolysis conditions. Novel carbon/alumina composites were prepared using co-polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer with fumed Al2O3 and subsequent pyrolysis of derived materials in inert atmosphere at 800 °C. Morphological and structural characteristics of as-obtained initial polymeric and carbon-inorganic nanocomposites were studied using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption methods, and temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry. The experimental results showed that filler Al2O3 acting as catalyst has significant influence on the resorcinol-formaldehyde polycondensation reaction and further pyrolysis step, therefore affects the structure of carbon-inorganic composites that is evidenced by the changes of specific surface area and porosity. It was shown that the porosity and texture of prepared composites substantially influenced the adsorption/desorption steps of explosives from aqueous samples. The results provide new ideas on the hybrid composites synthesis as well allow one to elucidate the effect of synthesis method on the structural characteristics of materials which can be used as high quality adsorbents in water treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85081723809"

To study the effects of polymerization on the decomposition of PTX, the reaction processes of PTX at different conditions were simulated by quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics methods. In this paper, the effects of polymerization on the decomposition of PTX were studied in terms of species information, reaction path of PTX, bond formation and bond cleavage, evolution of small molecules and clusters, and kinetic parameters at different stages. The results show that under the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, the initial reaction path of unimolecular PTX in the thermal decomposition is mainly the cleavage of C−NO2 bonds. At the same time, there are many polymerization reactions in thermal decomposition process, which may greatly affect the reaction rate and path. The higher the degree of polymerization, the larger equilibrium value of potential energy, the less energy release of thermal decomposition. Compared with the activation energy of other explosives, the activation energy of PTX is higher than that of β-HMX and lower than that of TNT. © 2020 The Authors.

The shock motion profiles are seen to follow a common trend in the shock acceleration–velocity frame, aside from an early time transient that is dependent on the initiating shock strength. The duration of the early time transient is seen to correlate with the initial shock strength. The common shock acceleration profile is seen to be Arrhenius-like with respect to the local particle velocity or pressure. A dual-rate pressure-dependent Arrhenius-type rate law is developed with the duration of the early rate set by the initial shock strength.

Examination of the thermal decomposition mechanism and kinetics of TNBI and DATNBI gives a more comprehensive view of the influence that the -NH2 group has on the sensitivity and storage safety of the energetic explosive-based TNBI molecular skeleton.

Although the decomposition peak temperature of DATNBI is significantly lower than that of TNBI at the same heating rate; its self-accelerating decomposition temperature (50 kg) is only 4 K lower.

Biological degradation was investigated in resting cell suspensions of Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15, a model Fe(III)-reducing Bacteria. Cells were amended into anoxic tubes buffered at pH 7.0, with initial 100 μM DNAN and 40-50 μM RDX.

Moreover, this product also affects the spectra of BRC cofactors in the NIR spectral region and stabilizes the conformational changes associated with slow charge recombination. The evolution of the NIR absorption changes correlated with the kinetics of the product formation.

Besides the ability to identify an individual with its patterns, fingerprint contains numerous key information about a suspect. Demonstrably, the secretion and deposition of chemical components in fingerprint can be used to analyze the characteristics of a suspect. The detection of substances in fingerprint has therewith aroused great interests of criminal investigators and forensic researchers since it facilitates narrowing the scope of criminal suspects. For example, in fighting against the violent crimes, the detection of ammunition and explosive residues in fingerprint can greatly help the investigation of the cases; the identification of drug residues and metabolites in fingerprint can provide information about whether the suspect uses drugs, smokes or is undergoing a disease treatment. The detection of food residues and cosmetic components in fingerprint can assist in inferring a suspect about his/her certain life habit. This paper reviews the researches on the detection of fingerprint from five aspects relating to drug users, smokers, explosive carriers, sexual assaulters and gender. The expounding mainly involves with the detection methods about biochemical choices (e.g., combining antibodies with fluorescent materials), biological assays (e.g., competitive enzyme immunoassay), instrumental analysis handlings (e.g., mass spectrometry, infrared spectrum analysis) and statistical ways. Based on the established researches and the problems confronted in the actual criminal investigation, three prospective development directions (of endogenous/exogenous substance and the age of fingerprint) are proposed for the forensic fingerprint intelligence analysis. Anyway, obtainment of more case information is always desirable for fingerprint identification so as to portray a suspect accurately further, and promote the role of forensic science in crime investigation and other legal processes as ably as possible. © 2020, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

Hugoniot calculations using the simple model framework under various limiting assumptions envelope measured Hugoniot states reasonably well and suggest that non-negligible deviatoric elastic strains may exist in the shock compressed state for weak impacts. An accompanying simple kinematic model for lattice deformation was used to estimate the expected shifts in X-ray diffraction peaks for the (211) plane under impacts normal to (110) planes. The results suggest that negligible relaxation of the deviatoric lattice deformation occurs on the short (10–20 ns) time and wave propagation (40–80 m) scales of laser-driven shock experiments, and that the corresponding elastic strains may be large. Because of the potentially large deviatoric elastic strains, the specific finite deformation strain measure used within thermomechanical single crystal models is of significant consequence, which is explored numerically by the comparison of isothermal purely elastic responses under uniaxial and simple shear deformations. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We observed both α-RDX and the metastable β-RDX phase using nanocalorimetry, along with the competitive vaporization and decomposition of RDX. Finally, nanocalorimetry coupled mass spectrometry was demonstrated to characterize thermal desorption events during analysis of trace quantities of explosives. © 2020","2-s2.0-85077943762"

The potassium salt of 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan (KDNBF) has attracted more and more attention due to its advantages of no heavy metal pollution to the environment and appropriate sensitivity. There are many reports on the thermal properties and applications of KDNBF, but few reports on the morphological properties. In addition, little is known about the optimal synthesis conditions of KDNBF with different morphologies in the preparation process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to determine the optimal experimental conditions for obtaining the maximum yields of KDNBF with different morphologies. The synthesized KDNBF was identified by means of SEM, NMR, FTIR, EA, and TG-DSC, and its sensitivity was measured using BAM fallhammer, BAM friction tester, and electrostatic spark sensitivity tester. The experimental results indicated that the maximum yields of flaky and spherical KDNBFs could reach 85.6 % and 82.6 % after purification under the optimal experimental condition, respectively. The spherical KDNBF powder had a relatively denser structure than the flaky KDNBF powder. The thermal analyses showed that the activation energies of the decomposition reaction of the flaky and spherical KDNBF powders calculated by the Kissinger method were 171.5 and 188.5 kJ mol−1, respectively, and the Ozawa method were 170.7 and 186.9 kJ mol−1, respectively. The thermal stability of spherical KDNBF powder was higher than that of flaky KDNBF powder. In addition, the sensitivity tests showed that the spherical KDNBF powder was less sensitive than the flaky KDNBF powder. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim","2-s2.0-85084005673"

To overcome this difficulty, we present a multi stable isotope approach using isotope ratio monitoring by mass spectrometry (irm-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometry (irm-NMR). In the one hand, irm-MS provides bulk isotopic composition at natural abundance in 13C and 15N. The range of variation between samples is rather small particularly for 13C. In the other hand, irm-13C NMR and irm-15N NMR enable the determination of positional intramolecular 13C/12C ratios (δ13Ci) and 15N/14N ratios (δ15Ni) with high precision that lead to larger variation between samples. The present work reports an application of the recent methodology using irm-15N NMR to determine position-specific 15N isotope content of TNT. The interest of this methodology is compared to irm-13C NMR and irm-MS (13C and 15N) in terms of TNT samples discrimination.

However, the current emphasis on the patterns fails to take advantage of additional chemical information they contain that may have a bearing on an investigation. One way this information can be useful is through correlating the fingerprint pattern with the presence of compounds that suggest exposure to compounds of interest, such as energetic materials that can be used to create explosive devices. We report here how interrogation of fingermarks by MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to expose the presence of the explosive compounds trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl and picric acid, while yielding the fingerprint pattern that is traditionally collected in crime scene investigation. Ion images derived from diagnostic [M−H]− ions at nominal m/z 226 and 228 for TNT and picric acid respectively, and the [M-NO2-H]− ion at m/z 241 for tetryl were generated and revealed the fingerprint pattern. Direct analysis in real-time high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) analysis of fingerprints was found to be useful in enabling rapid detection of diagnostic ions, so that their presence could inform whether subsequent MALDI-MSI experiments should be performed. The approach illustrates how DART-HRMS and MALDI-MSI in tandem can be employed in touch chemistry biometrics for revealing a direct connection between an individual and materials of forensic interest to which they have been exposed, such as explosives. © 2020","2-s2.0-85089271416"

A ~30 cm length fs filament obtained by a two-lens configuration was used to interrogate those energetic molecules in the form of pressed pellets (150 mg each). The plasma emissions were collected by a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) from a distance of ~8 m away from the investigation zone.

Therefore, there is an ongoing demand for methods of analysis with limits of detection at trace levels for these hazardous chemicals. Since human hair is one of the main physical attributes of our bodies, the interaction of hair surfaces with HE can be of critical importance in forensic and security applications. Noninvasive in situ approaches such as spectroscopic methods are preferred for elucidating these interactions. Among the spectroscopy-based methodologies, those based on Raman scattering are often favored because the sharpness of the vibrational signals facilitates the precise location of the peak maxima and enables more precise determination of the band shifts due to intermolecular interactions. This preliminary study is based on the detection of the HEs 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) on human hair strands by RS.

Results obtained were confirmed using portable systems operating at 785 and 1064 nm. Spectral data were preprocessed to correct a high fluorescence background exhibited by the samples due to the indole groups and melanin present in hair. Despite the high fluorescence levels that characterized all the samples, the vibrational signatures that identify the presence of the HEs studied could be detected once the optimum acquisition parameters were established. Among the three hair types studied, gray hair was the best substrate to observe the vibrations of HE crystals on hair.

The inner hollow shell of the microsphere could serve as sensitizing bubble when it was undamaged whatever the status of outer shell, and once it was broken, the materials in the outer and inner shells would react with each other and generate new sensitizing bubbles in emulsion explosive. The brisance and underwater explosion experimental results showed that when the addition of PRAs was determined to be 2 mass %, the resistance to dynamic pressure of emulsion explosive sensitized by glass microsphere (GM) would be improved significantly without affecting its power. The lead column compression of GM-2 mass % PRAs sensitized emulsion explosive was 16.05 mm, which was close to that of GM sensitized emulsion explosive.

For their toxic mechanisms, little is known about their interaction with cell membranes, although this is essential for their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity profiling. Here, we investigated the membrane permeation and partitioning of 12 nitroaromatic explosives with typical functional groups (e.g., -NO2, -NH2, -OCH3and -OH) by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Based on free-energy curves, we obtained three key parameters that describe the behavior of permeation and partitioning, namely liposome-water partition coefficient (KLW), permeability coefficient (P) and translocation time (τ). Functional groups contribute little toKLW, indicating that the membrane absorption of nitroaromatic explosives is primarily controlled by the hydrophobic effect of the benzene ring.Pshows an obvious decline with increasing polar group number (Np), and thereforeτexhibits a continuous increase. In addition, the preferred location (zmin) of explosive molecules in membranes is closer to the head group of lipids when they have more polar groups. Further analysis shows that the hydrogen bond (H-bond) interaction of explosives with water and lipids plays a crucial role in the dependence of permeation and partitioning on polar groups. The molecules with largerNpcan form more H-bonds with water in the aqueous phase, which limits their motion into the deeper hydrophobic region of membranes. Moreover, the desolvation/loss of H-bonds leavezmincontrols the membrane permeation properties, which is also correlated withNp. The work reveals the physical essence of the relationship between the membrane permeation and partitioning of nitroaromatic explosives and their functional groups.

To better understand the role of hydrogen in emulsion explosives, the detonation experiments with different gas storage were conducted. Several gases, such as helium, oxygen, and nitrogen, were taken into account. Brisance tests, detonation velocity tests, and underwater detonation experiments showed that the high-pressure hydrogen can improve the power and energy of emulsion explosive. The adiabatic compression of different gases was calculated. The pressure and temperature of the gas in GMs were obtained. Hydrogen has better compression performance than the other gases. Combining experiments and theoretical calculations can obtain that, hydrogen plays an important role in hot spots formation rate and emulsion explosive energy, and nitrogen and oxygen have little contribution to the energy of emulsion explosive, while helium is difficult to store in GMs and has a negative influence on the performance of emulsion explosive. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It can be prepared by nitrating benzofuroxan (BF) with mixed nitric/sulfuric acid. However, little is known about its optimal synthesis parameters in the preparation process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to improve the yield of 4,6-DNBF. A L9 (34) orthogonal array with four control factors and three levels of each control factor was used to design nine experimental conditions. The experimental data were transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio to analyze and evaluate the experimental conditions of the optimal parameter combination for the maximum yield of 4,6-DNBF. The verification results indicated that the optimal synthesis parameters were as follows: nitration temperature was 40 °C, mass ratio of BF to H2SO4, was 1 : 15, volume ratio of HNO3 to H2SO4 was 1 : 2.0 and reaction time was 4 hours, and then the maximum crude yield and the maximum yield after purification could reach 73.2 % and 49.0 %, respectively.

These materials exhibit a highly heterogeneous microstructure. The initiation of the detonation phenomenon in PBXs is believed to be generated at the microstructure scale through hotspots. Hence, many of the explosives properties (initiation, desensitization, etc.) are understood as a direct consequence of their microstructure. Mesoscale modeling directly addresses the physics of hotspot formation. Unfortunately, high computational cost prevents their use on laboratory-sized and large scale experiments. In practice, continuum-scale models remain mandatory. We describe a new reactive burn model, named WGT, aiming to represent, at the continuum scale, some of the complexity of the PBX's microstructure. The initiation regime is driven by the shock temperature and results from surrogate modeling of the kinetics of a heterogeneous nucleation and growth model. The other regimes follow the formulation of the WHS2D2 reactive burn model and are driven by the local temperature.

In this work, we present a numerical model to simulate the temporal evolution of aerosol metrics in an expanding cloud by coupling transient thermodynamic properties with important microphysical processes. To illustrate the application, the numerical model is applied to a typical HE, and the aerosol particle properties such as size distribution, number concentration, and average size are estimated from the numerical results.

Although the parent insensitive munition compound nitroguanidine (NQ) is generally not acutely toxic at concentrations >1000 mg/L in aquatic exposures, products formed by intensive ultraviolet (UV) degradation resulted in multiple-order of magnitude increases in toxicity. A methylated congener of NQ, 1-methyl-3-nitroguanidine (MeNQ), is also being assessed for potential use in insensitive munition explosive formulations; therefore, the present study investigated the hazard of parent versus UV-degraded MeNQ using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Although up to 716 mg/L parent MeNQ caused no significant mortality or effects on growth in larval P. promelas fish in 7-d exposures, a similar concentration of MeNQ subjected to UV treatment resulted in 85% mortality. The UV treatment degraded only 3.3% of the MeNQ (5800 mg/L stock, UV-treated for 6 h), indicating that MeNQ degradation products have potentially high toxicity. The parent MeNQ exposure caused significantly decreased transcriptional expression of genes within the significantly enriched insulin metabolic pathway, suggesting antagonism of bioenergetics pathways, which complements observed, although nonsignificant, decreases in body weight. Significant differential transcriptional expression in the UV-degraded MeNQ treatments resulted in significant enrichment of pathways and functions related to the cell cycle, as well as erythrocyte function involved in O2/CO2 exchange. These functions represent potential mechanistic sources of increased toxicity observed in the UV-degraded MeNQ exposures, which are distinct from previously observed mechanisms underlying increased toxicity of UV-degraded NQ in fish.

Hounsfield unit (HU), electron density (ED), effective atomic number (Zeff), and dual energy index (DEI),were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results: Except for DEI (p = 0.036), means of HU, ED, and Zeff were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between explosives ex-vivo and on the phantom (r > 0.80).

Consequently, the development of remote, noncontact detection systems continues to represent a path forward. In this vein, a remote detection system for excitation of infrared emissions using a CO2 laser for generating laser-induced thermal emission (LITE) is a possible solution. However, a LITE system using a CO2 laser has certain limitations, such as the requirement of careful alignment, interference by the CO2 signal during detection, and the power density loss due to the increase of the laser image at the sample plane with the detection distance. A remote chopped-laser induction system for LITE detection using a CO2 laser source coupled to a focusing telescope was built to solve some of these limitations. Samples of fixed surface concentration (500 μg / cm2) of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were used for the remote detection experiments at distances ranging between 4 and 8 m. This system was capable of thermally exciting and capturing the thermal emissions (TEs) at different times in a cyclic manner by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer coupled to a gold-coated reflection optics telescope (FTIR-GT). This was done using a wheel blocking the capture of TE by the FTIR-GT chopper while heating the sample with the CO2 laser. As the wheel moved, it blocked the CO2 laser and allowed the spectroscopic system to capture the TEs of RDX. Different periods (or frequencies) of wheel spin and FTIR-GT integration times were evaluated to find dependence with observation distance of the maximum intensity detection, minimum signal-to-noise ratio, CO2 laser spot size increase, and the induced temperature increment ( ""T).  © 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","2-s2.0-85092352952"

UV–vis analysis detected plasmon bands at 700 nm and 914 nm for PAFG. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of elemental Ag and C. Two PAFG phases were obtained after centrifugation, which were designated as PAFG1 and PAFG2. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analyses showed that the rhodamine 6G (R6G) peaks with PAFG1 were 1.75 times larger than those with trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1.7 times larger than those with pyrene. SERS analysis of TNT with PAFG2 obtained 1.49 and 1.3 times greater peaks compared with those using pyrene and R6G, respectively. On average, the performance was around 1.4 times better with PAFG2 for each of the analytes. Measurements of the SERS spectra for TNT and pyrene with annealed PAFG (at mM and μM concentrations) showed that the enhancement factors (EFs) were 2.2 and 1.7 for the μM TNT and pyrene samples, respectively.

We devised a method of using a shaped-charge jet-penetrating cover to shock-initiate heated explosives. This method achieves uniform temperature control of explosives via heating the upper and lower ends and preserves heat on the side of the explosive charge. We experimentally tested the method on hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)-based aluminized explosives (61 wt.% RDX, 30 wt.% Al, 9 wt.% binder) at different temperatures and cover thicknesses. The jet-penetration behavior and explosive detonation-wave growth were observed via X-ray photography, and the effect of explosive temperature on jet initiation was analyzed. A numerical model of the shaped-charge jet-initiating explosive was set up by considering the temperature change of the explosive and analyzing the detonation-wave growth and initiation thresholds of different explosive temperatures under jet shock initiation. Under a thin cover, the explosive showed prompt impact initiation by the jet; the initiation occurred very near to the explosive surface. However, for a thick cover, the explosion was initiated by a bow wave formed at a certain distance from the upper surface of the explosive, and a retonation wave was observed. The temperature of RDX-based aluminized explosives affects the two jet-initiation mechanisms. The shock sensitivity of the explosives to the jet decreased with increasing temperature, but the shock sensitivity increased when the temperature exceeded a certain value. A simulation method was established that can be used to predict shaped-charge jet initiation at different explosive temperatures. We obtained the relationship between the cover thickness and run-to-detonation distance under jet shock initiation, which provides a theoretical basis for safety analysis and evaluation of a warhead charge that is attacked by a shaped-charge jet. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For micro-TATB, the initiation threshold significantly decreases with TATB average size ranging from 79.7 μm to 0.5 μm. For 3D nanoporous TATB architecture, the initiation threshold decreases and then increases with specific surface areas increased from 9.6 m2/g to 36.2 m2/g. The lowest initiation thresholds are obtained for the micro-TATB with average sizes of 1.3 μm and 0.5 μm, and 3D nanoporous TATB architecture with specific surface area of 22.4 m2/g. The shock initiation thresholds of micro-TATB and 3D nanoporous TATB architectures show significantly decreases with the porosity increased.

High porosity provides more collapse sites to generate high temperature for formation of hot spots. The low thermal conductivity and decomposition temperature could enhance the formation and ignition of the hot spots, and initial decomposition reaction of TATB. The effect of the decomposition temperature is higher than that of the thermal conductivity on the shock initiation properties.

Common electronics are used in the design of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), targeting military, and civilian populations, while concealed recording devices steal proprietary/confidential data, compromising both government and industrial resources. This paper discusses a novel, nonintrusive, repeatable, reliable, expandable, and simple-to-implement detection and identification (DI) system for identifying threats by using unintended radiated emissions (URE). This paper differs from current URE proposals, by avoiding energy radiation. The proposed process also addresses big data problems involved in capturing and building databases of URE characteristics. Issue interpretation is utilized with URE data to distinguish between threat/nonthreat devices using multiple criteria decision analysis and other decision-making techniques to determine model and mode of hidden devices. System optimization, verified by testing, is used to improve the speed and accuracy of the identification algorithm. The system is developed with data from 130 devices and validated with 33 separate devices, which are representative of IED and espionage threats.

Currently applied methods are not capable of meeting all requirements, and hence, portable mass spectrometry is an interesting alternative although many instrumental challenges still exist. To be able to analyze explosives with mass spectrometry outside the traditional laboratory, suitable ambient ionization methods need to be developed. Ideally such methods are also easily implemented in the field requiring limited to no power sources, gas supplies, flow controllers, and heating devices. For this reason, the potential of SAWN (surface acoustic wave nebulization) for the ambient ionization and subsequent mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of organic explosives was investigated in this study. Excellent sensitivity was observed for nitrate-based organic explosives when operating the MS in negative mode. No dominant adduct peaks were observed for the peroxides TATP and HMTD with SAWN-MS in positive mode. The MS spectra indicate extensive fragmentation of the peroxide explosives even under the mild ionization conditions provided by SAWN. The potential of SAWN-MS was demonstrated with the correct identification of nitrate-based organic explosives in pre- and post-explosion case samples in only a fraction of the time and effort required for the regular laboratory analysis. Results show that SAWN-MS can convincingly identify intact organic energetic compounds and mixtures but that sensitivity is not always sufficient to detect traces of explosives in post-explosion residues.

However, these nitro groups can be reduced to amino groups by soil microorganisms, making them more prone to oxidation. In this study, we propose bioreduction as a pretreatment to ISCO. The oxidation of DNAN, DNT, NTO, and their respective reduced transformation products, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline (MENA), 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (NAT), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (ATO), by potassium permanganate showed that lower permanganate concentrations and shorter time-scales are needed to oxidize the compounds once they are reduced. Significant fractions of the daughter products were mineralized to CO2 (30% and 22% for MENA and NAT, respectively, using 2.5 mM permanganate, and 48% for ATO using 1.0 mM permanganate). The bioreductive pretreatment was demonstrated by incubating 1.0 mM NTO anaerobically using soil as inoculum and pyruvate as electron donor. Once NTO was completely reduced to ATO, 1.0 mM permanganate was added, immediately oxidizing 86% of the compound. In controls without pretreatment, no oxidation was observed. NTO and ATO oxidation was tested in soils that differed in organic matter content. The results indicate that natural organic matter decreases the efficiency of NTO oxidation.

It addresses, in particular, problems where mission-critical performance is paramount, such as in aircraft, missiles, nuclear reactors and weapons, submarines, and many other types of systems where “failure” can result in overwhelming loss of life and property. The book is divided into four parts: Fundamentals, Electronics, Software, and Dangerous Goods. The first part on Fundamentals addresses general concepts of system safety engineering that are applicable to any type of system. The second part, Electronics, addresses the detection and correction of electronic hazards. In particular, the Bent Pin Problem, Sneak Circuit Problem, and related electrical problems are discussed with mathematical precision. The third part on Software addresses predicting software failure rates as well as detecting and correcting deep software logical flaws (called defects). The fourth part on Dangerous Goods presents solutions to three typical industrial chemical problems faced by the system safety engineer during the design, storage, and disposal phases of a dangerous goods’ life cycle. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2-s2.0-85146302266"

The RDF is trained with a training set of mg-amounts of different explosives, i.e., TNT, RDX, PETN, NaClO3, and NH4NO3, on an artificial aluminum substrate. The resulting classification is validated, and variable importance is used to optimize the RDF using spectral descriptors, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data set.

The addition of nitramine to AN propellants is one of the approaches to overcome these disadvantages. However, AN/nitramine propellants are characterized by easy initiation, high sensitivity, and high detonation velocity because of the high energy of nitramine. The detonation properties of AN/nitramine propellants were investigated in this study. It was observed that the AN/nitramine propellant required a booster to detonate the propellants, as detonation did not occur while using only a commercial electric blasting cap. It was further observed that the detonation velocity (D) increased linearly as the mass of nitramine per unit propellant volume was increased, and AN had a negligible effect on the detonation properties. An approximate equation was derived from the relationship between D and the mass per unit propellant volume of nitramine. The dominant factors that can be used to estimate the detonation/no-detonation boundaries of the propellants were identified, and the experimental boundary equations were determined using these factors. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85065392704"

We demonstrate herein a workflow suitable for the determination of nitrogen-based explosives at the picogram level in just minutes. Methods: A method is described that combines Thermal Desorption (TD) sample introduction with Differential Mobility Analysis (DMA) Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS), enabling a sensitive and accurate workflow suitable for the rapid detection of trace nitroaromatic, nitroester and nitramine explosive vapors. The methods are bridged using a novel low-flow, field-free Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization (APPI) source, intended specifically for the analysis of gas-phase analytes and airborne particles. Results: Limits of detection within or below the picogram range were determined for the analysis of a range of explosives standards including 2,6-DNT, TNT, TATB, Tetryl, RDX, EGDN, PETN, HMX, and NG. Practical application of the TD-APPI-DMA-MS/MS workflow was demonstrated for the detection of real trace explosive vapors produced from the volatilization of solid explosive samples stored within a sealed cardboard box.

We created a computational model of the WAMI system, including the camera and algorithms for processing, exploitation, and dissemination. We also synthesized input data consisting of objects and activities taking place in a city over two days. We compared the model’s output versus input to quantify its overall value to the counter-IED mission. We exercised the model twice: forensically to identify insurgents after the IED explosions and prospectively to identify insurgents as early as possible beforehand. Although better sensors led to better intermediate results, they did not always lead to greater overall value. Once the number of true positives saturated at its best possible value, the number of false positives continued to grow as the quality of the sensor improved.

The results show that the peak value of Mach wave pressure in DLSC is not increased compared with that in ordinary shaped charge (OSC), but the attenuation speed of Mach wave pressure can be delayed and ultimately in the ODD state.

SHRS measurements of the latter produced low background interference in the extracted Raman spectrum because the broad band fluorescence (i.e., a direct current, or DC, component) does not contribute to the interferogram intensity (i.e., the alternating current, or AC, component). SHRS spectral resolution, throughput, and signal-to-noise ratio are also discussed along with the merits of using sapphire Raman bands as internal performance references and as internal wavelength calibration standards in Raman measurements. © The Author(s) 2019.","2-s2.0-85072942822"

The siderophore PVD exhibited enhanced fluorescence quenching above 50% at 470 nm for a minimal concentration (38 nM) of NTO. The limit of detection estimated from interpolating the graph of fluorescence intensity (at 470 nm) versus NTO concentration is found to be 12 nM corresponding to 18% quenching. The time delay fluorescence spectroscopy of the PVD-NTO solution showed a negligible change of 0.09 ns between the minimum and maximum NTO concentrations. The in silico absorption at the emission peak of static fluorescence remains invariant upon the addition of NTO. The computational studies revealed the formation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between the energetically stable complexes of PVD and NTO. Although the analysis of Stern-Volmer plots and computational studies imply that the quenching mechanism is a combination of both dynamic and static quenching, the latter is dominant over the earlier. The static quenching is attributed to ground-state complex formation, as supported by the computational analysis. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85084077297"

Commercially available various analytical and spectroscopic techniques suffer from low sensitivity, swabbing of surfaces and low detection limit. Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), used in improvised explosive devices IEDs vaporizes readily at room temperature and has a vapour signature. However, explosive trace detectors (ETDs) are incompetent to detect TATP due to absence of chromophoric groups. We have investigated the novel hollow core photonic crystal fibres (HC-PCFs) based Raman sensor for real time monitoring of such volatile explosives in airport security. Raman scattering, a powerful, non-destructive tool provides molecular fingerprinting and is a potential candidate for detection of trace explosives but suffer from weak signal strength. Simultaneous confinement of pumped light and gas in HCFs allows greater light gas interaction providing an excellent optical sensing platform. These sensors can be easily incorporated at the security terminals or baggage counters with the existing metal detection systems. This paper reports investigations carried out on the HC-PCF designed using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The Raman signal being dependent on its intensity and mode area, simulations were conducted to analyse PCF parameters like confinement losses and mode field diameter/ effective mode area and its associated wavelength dependency. Theoretical study carried out on the HC-PCF also revealed that mode field confinements within the hollow core can be modified to suit specific laser wavelengths and confinement losses can be reduced to achieve Raman signal enhancement by optimizing their geometrical parameters like air-hole size and pitch/ hole-to-hole distance. © 2020 SPIE","2-s2.0-85096351923"

For this IED, fragmentation is the primary injury mechanism, which makes them a desirable weapon for terrorists aiming to inflict maximum human casualties. Although the investigation of fragmentation pattern is not novel, there is limited data available on pipe bombs performance in the open literature. Therefore, this research is looking at validating results in current literature, which showed limited repetition and weak experimental design so far; by trial with six pipe bombs with two different thickness (3 of each).

The persistence on surfaces of these traces depends on the sublimation processes and the interactions with the surfaces. This study presents evidence that the sublimation process of these traces on stainless steel (SS) surfaces is very different than in bulk quantities. The enthalpies of sublimation of traces of four highly energetic materials: triacetone triperoxide (TATP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 1,3,5- trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) deposited on SS substrates were determined by optical fiber coupled-grazing angle probe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. These were compared with enthalpies of sublimation determined by thermal gravimetric analysis for bulk amounts and differences between them were found. The sublimation enthalpy of RDX was very different for traces than for bulk quantities, attributed to two main factors. First, the beta-RDX phase was present at trace levels, unlike the case of bulk amounts which consisted only of the alpha-RDX phase. Second, an interaction between the RDX and SS was found. This interaction energy was determined using grazing angle FTIR microscopy. In the case of DNT and TNT, bulk and traces enthalpies were statistically similar, but it is evidenced that at the level of traces a metastable phase was observed. Finally, for TATP the enthalpies were statistically identical, but a non-linear behavior and a change of heat capacity values different from zero was found for both trace and bulk phases. ©2019 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85072701146"

Under current environmental legislation the extent of the contamination must be characterized by soil sampling and subsequent separation of the explosive contaminants from the soil matrix by extraction to enable chemical analysis and quantification (Dean, 2009). It is essential that the extraction method can consistently recover explosive residue from a variety of soil types i.e. all materials that have not degraded or irreversibly bound to the matrix, so that any resultant risk is not underestimated. In this study, five different soil types with a range of organic content, particle size and pH, were spiked with a mixture of RDX, DNAN, NQ and NTO at 50 mg/kg and were extracted using one of four one-step extraction methods: stirring, shaking, sonication, and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Analysis of the extraction efficiencies of the four methods found that they were broadly successful for the extraction of all IHE constituents from all five soils (an average of 84% ± 14% recovery across 80 extractions). However, soils with high organic content (Total Organic Content (TOC) ≥ 2%) were found to significantly affect extraction efficiency and reproducibility. NTO and DNAN were the least consistent in extraction efficiency with poorest recovery of NTO as low as 37% ± 2%. Of the four tested methods shaking was found to be the most reproducible, though less efficient than stirring (64%–91%). ASE was found to have the most variable results for extraction of IHE constituents suggesting that ASE was the most affected by the different soil types. Therefore, it is recommended that the efficiency and reproducibility of the selected extraction method should be validated by extracting known concentrations of the IHE from the soil of interest and that any required correction factors are reported. © 2019","2-s2.0-85062472841"

The analytical chemistry of explosives has a long tradition of spot test and more traditional approaches, such as chromatography, but has also new tools, such as electro-optical ones, allowing both point detection and remote sensing. In this chapter, four spectroscopic laser based techniques are presented highlighting working principles and capabilities in discriminating explosive compounds at trace level, in field operation, locally or remotely. For each techniques, the detection limits and drawbacks are reported in the application to trace sensing. Such electro-optics tools do not aim to replace the traditional laboratory methods, rather to support them in security applications and in narrowing the area under investigation, reducing the number of samples selected for laboratory analysis. More traditional approaches are then presented and discussed to illustrate the latest development with respect to on-site testing, sampling and analysis by chromatography, electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","2-s2.0-85075806044"

It can be synthesized by reacting aminoguanidinium bicarbonate (AGB) with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in the presence of acetic acid. However, little is known about its optimal synthesis parameters in the manufacturing process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to further improve the yield of tetrazene. Under the condition that the molar ratio of AGB to NaNO2 was fixed at 1.0:1.2, a L9(33) orthogonal array with three control factors and three levels for each control factor was used to design nine experimental conditions. The experimental data were transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio to analyze and evaluate the experimental conditions of the optimal parameter combination for the maximum yield of tetrazene. Verification of the results indicated that the optimal synthesis parameters were as follows: pH value of AGB solution was 5.0, reaction temperature was 35 °C and reaction time was 6 h; the maximum yield of tetrazene could reach 83.7%. Furthermore, the synthesized tetrazene was identified and characterized by elemental analysis (EA), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), optical microscopy (OM), particle size distribution analysis (PSDA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and its impact sensitivity was determined using a BAM Fallhammer apparatus and the Bruceton analysis method. © 2020 Lukasiewicz Research Network-Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry, Poland.","2-s2.0-85086757228"

The proposed EOS regards the gasification of aluminum particles as a real reaction. The proposed EOS takes account of constituent aluminum particle sizes. The proposed EOS was implemented in LS-DYNA as a user defined EOS and validated by simulating the experiments of metal plates acceleration caused by detonation of RDX-based aluminized explosives. The numerical results reproduce the experimental finding that the reaction rate of aluminum particles increases with the decrease of aluminum particle size. The proposed EOS has several advantages over the previously reported equations of state for aluminized explosives. The reaction rate of aluminum constituents is calculated theoretically from their gasification reaction rate equation eliminating the need for experimental calibration of the corresponding empirical parameters. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The interaction between LCOF-BTT1 and nitrobenzene has been investigated by DFT and TDDFT methods. By studying electronic configurations and frontier molecular orbitals, the luminescence mechanism of LCOF-BTT1 has changed due to the hydrogen bonding formed between LCOF-BTT1 and nitrobenzene (Complex 1). Further study of electronic transition energies, hydrogen bond lengths, 1H NMR and IR spectra of Complex 1 reveals that hydrogen bonding is stronger in the excited state than in the ground state, indicating fluorescence quenching. Furthermore, the fluorescence rate coefficient and the internal conversion rate coefficient of Complex 1 are correspondingly decreased and increased, indicating that the increase in the strength of hydrogen bonding in the excited state is beneficial to the non-radiative transition and is not conducive to the radiation transition. © 2019","2-s2.0-85072254650"

The growing and extensive use of nanotechnology being applied in forensic investigations is promising and could soon be the tipping point in the discipline. Applications mainly have been related to evidence identification and analysis in the broad major fields in Forensic Science such as single-crystalline semiconductor CdS nano slabs for explosives detection, functionalized TiO2 nanorods for organophosphorus chemical warfare agents in Forensic Chemistry, the use of Na-nopowders for latent print visualization in Forensic physics and Gold nanoparticle protein nanopore for detection of single-stranded DNA in Forensic biology.

In collaboration with the Dutch police a representative sample set of the most frequently confiscated flash bangers, the Cobra 6 and Cobra 6 2G, has previously been collected also including imitation items. Classification of the different flash bangers was performed by analysing the pyrotechnic charge using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with indirect UV-detection. Two rapid CE methods were used to determine the anions and cations present in the pyrotechnic mixtures. Black and flash powders were easily distinguishable based on their main inorganic compositions, i.e., KNO3 and KClO4, respectively. Differentiation of flash powders from the commercial and imitation pyrotechnic items was achieved by the identification of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cation traces in the imitation flash banger powders. Quantitative CE results were used to explore the possibilities to differentiate seized sets of flash bangers but this proved to be difficult for commercial items due to lack of impurities and uniform production processes. In addition, inherent inhomogeneity of the powders and incomplete sample extraction yielded a relative high measurement uncertainty within a set. For the imitation items potential for set-based differentiation was observed. Although the number of seized imitation sets was limited, a first step has been taken to classify pyrotechnic mixtures to provide additional information and intelligence in forensic casework of flash bangers. © 2019 The Authors.

The main methods of remote detection of explosives using laser radiation are listed. Particular attention is paid to the areas of research that have been recently formed such as spectral selective resonance interaction of laser radiation with explosives and explosives modified by nano-additives. It was noted that depending on the choice of the optical absorption band of the explosives, its excitation can lead either to the effective activation of an explosive or to its decomposition, which is not accompanied by a significant thermal effect. The latter case can be used for remote detection of the explosives and, partly, for passivation of their surface.

However, texture-tailoring approaches have not yet been widely explored, in part because of a lack of understanding of the specific wipe topographies and wipe/particle interactions that maximize particle collection. Here we describe an in situ optical microscopy technique that enables direct observation of micrometer-scale particle-wipe interactions occurring at the wipe-substrate interface during contact sampling. The technique is demonstrated for nonwoven meta-aramid (Nomex) collection wipes with particles ranging from 1 to 90 μm in diameter and substrates of different topographies (glass and nylon coil zipper). Experiments with hemispherically coated Janus particles allow rolling motions to be distinguished from sliding motions, providing detailed information about how particles move prior to capture or release by the wipe. Particle-fiber and particle-particle interactions are seen to play important roles in particle capture, suggesting that conventional sphere-on-plane models are inadequate to describe adhesion behavior in these systems. Micrographs show how loose, flexible fibers in roughened textile wipes interrogate the valleys of uneven substrate topographies, allowing capture of particles that might otherwise be trapped within the substrate's grooves and depressions.

In this work for the first time we show that not only polymorphisms in selected canine olfactory receptor genes, but also polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter protein for dopamine uptake or the 5-HT2B receptor, are important for canine olfactory detection. The G allele at the OR52N9-like:c.176 A > G and OR52N9-like:c.288 T > G loci had a negative, whereas the A allele at the OR9S13-like:c.592 G > A locus had a positive, effect on the dogs' detection performance measured as mean search time and mean search style. Additionally, the presence of the C allele in the SLC6A3-like:c.181 G > C locus and the A allele in HTR2B-like:c.596 G > A locus was associated with reduced detection performance. We suggest that good candidate dogs for detection training could be chosen for military and civilian service based on favourable genotypes in the olfactory and monoamine neurotransmitter receptor genes. This, however, should be investigated further in studies, particularly using dogs with the alleles of the candidate genes we have identified as correlated with increased performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85064313266"

The tissue disruption associated with ballistic injury to the head and neck region can be daunting, and the identification of normal anatomic planes, potentially lost within bleeding, destroyed soft and hard tissues, can challenge the skills of even the most experienced facial trauma specialist. While classically considered to be under the purview of the military trauma surgeon, ballistic and blast injuries are routinely treated by the civilian surgeon due to the incidence of intentional and unintentional firearm injuries and industrial accidents. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the recent surge of terrorist attacks in locales such as Paris, France and Orlando, Florida, the civilian craniomaxillofacial trauma surgeon must have not only a working knowledge of the management of ballistic wounds to the craniofacial region, but also an understanding of the staging and timing of the treatment of these injuries.

However, characterization of their interfacial micro-structures remains challenging, due to the sensitive nature of the explosive material, and the extremely thin nature of the interface. This work demonstrates a concept of characterizing interfacial structures between explosives and binders by gas permeation. The N2 permeability data of composite films of cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) particles dispersed in fluororubber binder (copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and chlorotrifluoro-ethylene, F2311) were tested and fitted by using gas transport mechanism theory, e. g. the Hashemifard-Ismail-Matsuura (HIM) model, and the Knudsen diffusion equation. The results indicate the presence of voids of thickness 2.2 nm between HMX and F2311, consistent with the results of neutron reflection and thermal conductivity measurements. These interfacial voids are considered to be related to the surface roughness of HMX particles. This work provides an alternative characterization technique for, as well as a new insight into, the interface between HMX and F2311. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This article reports the detection of smokeless powder organic additives (in their pre-detonation condition), namely the stabiliser diphenylamine and its derivatives 2-nitrodiphenylamine and 4-nitrodiphenylamine, and the additives (used both as stabilisers and plasticisers) methyl centralite and ethyl centralite, by means of swab sampling followed by thermal desorption and direct injection soft chemical ionisation-mass spectrometry. Investigations on the product ions resulting from the reactions of the reagent ions H3O+ and O2+ with additives as a function of reduced electric field are reported. The method was comprehensively evaluated in terms of linearity, sensitivity and precision. For H3O+, the limits of detection (LoD) are in the range of 41–88 pg of additive, for which the accuracy varied between 1.5 and 3.2%, precision varied between 3.7 and 7.3% and linearity showed R2 ≥ 0.9991. For O2+, LoD are in the range of 72 to 1.4 ng, with an accuracy of between 2.8 and 4.9% and a precision between 4.5 and 8.6% and R2 ≥ 0.9914.

Therefore, a study of the effect of temperature on the shock initiation of explosives is of great significance. We carried out a series of tests on explosive-driven flyer-initiating heated RDX-based aluminized explosives (61 wt % RDX, 30 wt % Al, 9 wt % binder) and the temperature and input shock pressure of the explosives were controlled accurately during the tests. The pressure histories at different depths inside the explosives were measured by using manganin pressure gauges, and the effect of temperature on detonation wave growth was analysed. The ignition and growth reaction model, some parameters of which rely on temperature, was used to simulate the shock-initiation processes. The relationship between the model parameters and the temperature were obtained from the experimental results. The run distance to detonation as a function of the initial input pressure in a temperature range, the Pop plot, and the reaction degree of the explosives were determined. For the RDX-based aluminized explosives, binder softening and the increasing sensitivity of RDX are the two main reasons that change the shock sensitivity. For 25 °C–110 °C, the shock sensitivity decreases with an increase in temperature, mainly because of binder softening. However, for 110 °C–170 °C, the shock sensitivity increases with an increase in temperature, which depends on the increasing sensitivity of the RDX. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore bioremediation of contaminated sites through transgenic plants has recently been highlighted. Trans-genesis leads to the overexpression of selected degradative genes/enzymes, namely, nitroreductase and cytochrome P450, of microorganisms, which could enhance not only the plant tolerance but also uptake and degradation performances.

To manually interpret and identify all of the constituent polymers and other interesting features in the acquired mass spectra is a tedious and time-consuming challenge.

Firstly, the conservation equations including all source terms but combustion source terms are solved, in this case the numerical fluxes are computed by using Rusanov numerical scheme. Diffusive source terms are solved explicitly.

Experimental results showed the dependence of the mobility with the organic modifiers (mass and size) for the case of TIMS-MS. Different from trends observed in drift tube like IMS devices, no correlation between the mobility resolving power and resolution in TIMS was observed with the bath gas composition (e.g., air, air + methanol, air +2-propanol, and air + acetone).

Three chemical mixtures acted as surrogates for materials relevant to screening operations: explosives-related compounds, protein decomposition compounds, and gasoline. In this feasibility study, portable PLOT-cryoadsorption successfully collected components of each mixture in a variety of weather conditions and with short vapor collection times well suited to a field environment. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used for sample analysis. © 2019","2-s2.0-85072278404"

On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions killed 165 people and injured hundreds more at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin. In this study, we applied image interpretation methods to determine the seat of the explosion by analyzing low-quality video clips of the event. The interpretation fits well with recently published standard operating procedures, including the hypothesis, evaluation, inference, and confirmation. Image processing was adopted to enhance the images while the explosion scene was reconstructed with the same images. Some important features were extracted and utilized to distinguish whether the flashes were caused by reflection or a real blast. We reveal the real explosion location, which guides the overall investigation. The results indicate that image interpretation is a powerful tool for forensic investigators to analyze low-quality images in complicated explosions or fire accidents. © 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","2-s2.0-85061251659"
