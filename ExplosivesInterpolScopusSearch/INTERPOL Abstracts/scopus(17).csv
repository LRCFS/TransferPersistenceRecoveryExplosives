One major shortcoming of current explosive models is the lack of chemical kinetics data of the reacting explosive at the high pressures and temperatures experienced under detonation conditions. In the absence of experimental data, long time-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with reactive chemistry provide insight into the decomposition mechanisms of explosives and allow us to obtain effective reaction rates. These rates can then be incorporated into a thermochemical continuum code for accurate and predictive description of grain- and continuum-scale dynamics of reacting explosives. During the course of the past decade, we have examined the chemistry of several reacting explosive materials, such as the high-performing HMX and the very insensitive TATB explosives, both of which are organic molecular solids at ambient conditions. We have used quantum-based, self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method to calculate the interatomic forces in molecular dynamics simulations either for thermal decomposition studies (constant volume-temperature) or dynamical shock studies using the multiscale shock simulation technique (MSST). These studies allow us to investigate the chemical reactivity of explosives and to examine electronic properties at extreme conditions of temperature and pressure for a relatively long timescale on the order of several hundreds of picoseconds. In this chapter, we discuss challenges in simulating the reactions of shocked energetic materials and review specific examples of our recent simulations on HMX, PETN, and shocked TATB. Each of these studies revealed interesting aspects associated with known macroscopic properties of these materials. We also discuss simulations on nonenergetic materials such as shocked carbon and methane. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLC.","2-s2.0-84893805354"

Distributions of fragment velocities and fragment masses were measured and analyzed for specimens with different depths of the external grooves and different explosive materials, with the internal grooves of a fixed rectangular shape. Based on the experimental results, corresponding numerical simulations using the commercial software LS-DYNA were undertaken. By inspecting the fragments recovered from the experiments and the numerical results, the dynamic fracture of the casing led to fragments of approximately three shapes: A large cuboid fragment, a small cuboid fragment, and two irregular fragments formed by three classical fracture trajectories. The formation mechanism of fragment shapes was analyzed using the fracture trajectories. A good agreement has been obtained between the numerical and experimental results. Finally, a parametric study for the casing thickness, grid patterns of the grooves and explosive materials was carried out in order to investigate the effects of fracture. The results showed that grid patterns of grooves and explosive materials had significant effects on the fracture mechanism of the casing. The numerical technique was used to predict the dynamic fracture of casing with internal and external grooves under internal explosive loading and for structural design in order to achieve desirable fragments with controlled shapes. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Evaluation requires dynamic measurements of detonation velocity, pressure, and expansion energy - typically in separate experiments that require large amounts of material, time, and expense. There is also a need for evaluation of the total available thermodynamic energy. The dynamic evaluations, in particular, have been a major hindrance to development of new explosives. The new experimental testing method to be described here requires small charges and obtains accurate measurement of all three of the detonation performance characteristics in a single test. The design, a Disc Acceleration eXperiment (DAX), provides an initial condition of steady detonation and a charge-geometry amenable to 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The velocity history of a metal disk attached to the end of the explosive charge is measured with Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV). This disc velocity data is analyzed to give both CJ pressure and expansion energy. The detonation velocity is obtained with probes along the charge length. The experiments and subsequent analyses are concentrated on LX-16, a known PETN based explosive, for the purpose of establishing the accuracy of the method and to provide a standard for comparison with other explosives. We present details of the experimental design and also detonation velocity and PDV results from a number of experiments. The total available internal energy for the explosive was obtained from published detonation calorimetry measurements by Ornellas [1], and from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. An equation-of-state (EOS) for LX-16 was derived from hydrodynamic simulations of thin plate-push velocity-time data. We will show a successful comparison with a previously published Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) EOS for PETN by Green and Lee [2-4]. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.","2-s2.0-84923873338"

Research into the mechanisms with which explosives disrupt physiological processes could provide methods for discrimination of anthropogenic and natural stresses. Our objectives were to experimentally evaluate the effects of natural stress and explosives on plant physiology and to link differences among treatments to changes in hyperspectral reflectance for possible remote detection. Methods: Photosynthesis, water relations, chlorophyll fluorescence, and hyperspectral reflectance were measured following four experimental treatments (drought, salinity, trinitrotoluene and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-l,3,5-triazine) on two woody species. Principal Components Analyses of physiological and hyperspectral results were used to evaluate the differences among treatments. Results: Explosives induced different physiological responses compared to natural stress responses. Stomatal regulation over photosynthesis occurred due to natural stress, influencing energy dissipation pathways of excess light. Photosynthetic declines in explosives were likely the result of metabolic dysfunction. Select hyperspectral indices could discriminate natural stressors from explosives using changes in the red and near-infrared spectral region. Conclusions: These results show the possibility of using variations in energy dissipation and hyperspectral reflectance to detect plants exposed to explosives in a laboratory setting and are promising for field application using plants as phytosensors to detect explosives contamination in soil. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).","2-s2.0-84876436983"

A small scale experiment was developed to characterize HMEs such as ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixtures. A microwave interferometer is applied to small scale confined transient experiments, yielding time resolved characterization of a failing detonation that is initiated with an ideal explosive booster charge. Experiments were performed with ammonium nitrate and two fuel compositions (diesel fuel and mineral oil). It was observed that the failure dynamics were influenced by factors such as the chemical composition, confiner thickness, and applied shock wave strength. Thin steel walled confiners with 0.71mm wall thickness experienced detonation failure and decoupling of the shock wave from the reaction zone. Confiners with a wall thickness of 34.9mm showed a decrease in propagation speed and a steady reactive wave was achieved. Varying the applied shock strength by using an attenuator showed corresponding changes in the initial overdriven reactive wave velocity in the HMEs. The distance to detonation failure was also shown to depend on the attenuator length when thin wall confinement was used. This experimental method is shown to be repeatable and can be performed with little required material (about 2g). The data obtained could be useful to model development and validation, as well as quantifying detonability of materials. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","2-s2.0-84905816168"

The international mine action community is concerned with the relief of this threat. The Space Assets for Demining Assistance (SADA) undertaking is a set of activities that aim at developing new services to improve the socio-economic impact of mine action activities, primarily focused on the release of land thought to be contaminated, a process described as land release. SADA was originally initiated by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). It has been implemented under the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) program of the European Space Agency (ESA). Land release in mine action is the process whereby the demining community identifies, surveys and prioritizes suspected hazardous areas for more detailed investigation, which eventually results in the clearance of landmines and other explosives, thereby releasing land to the local population. SADA has a broad scope, covering activities, such as planning (risk and impact analysis, prioritization, and resource management), field operations and reporting. SADA services are developed in two phases: feasibility studies followed by demonstration projects. Three parallel feasibility studies have been performed. They aimed at defining an integrated set of space enabled services to support the land release process in mine action, and at analyzing their added value, viability and sustainability. The needs of the mine action sector have been assessed and the potential contribution of space assets has been identified. Support services have been formulated. To test their fieldability, proofs of concept involving mine action end users in various operational field settings have been performed by each of the study teams. The economic viability has also been assessed. Whenever relevant and cost-effective, SADA aims at integrating Earth observation data, GNSS navigation and SatCom technologies with existing mine action tools and procedures, as well as with novel aerial survey technologies. Such conformity with existing user processes, as well as available budgets and appropriateness of technology based solutions given the field level operational setting are important conditions for success. The studies have demonstrated that Earth observation data, satellite navigation solutions and in some cases, satellite communication, indeed can provide added value to mine action activities if properly tailored based on close user interaction and provided through a suitable channel. Such added value for example includes easy and sustained access to Earth observation data for general purpose mapping, land use assessment for post-release progress reporting, and multi-source data fusion algorithms to help quantify risks and socio-economic impact for prioritization and planning purposes. The environment and boundaries of a hazardous area can also be better specified to support the land release process including detailed survey and clearance operations. Satellite communication can help to provide relevant data to remote locations, but is not regarded as strongly user driven. Finally, satellite navigation can support more precise non-technical surveys, as well as aerial observation with small planes or hand-launched UAV's. To ensure the activity is genuinely user driven, the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) plays an important role as ESA's external advisor. ESA is furthermore supported by a representative field operator, the Swiss Foundation of Mine Action (FSD), providing ESA with a direct connection to the field level end users. Specifically FSD has provided a shared user needs baseline to the three study teams. To ensure solutions meet with end user requirements, the study teams themselves include mine action representatives and have interacted closely with their pre-existing and newly established contacts within the mine action community. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the hydrogeological changes to the vadose zone caused by military training with high explosive ammunition. In particular, this study investigates artillery ammunition which penetrates underground prior to exploding, either by design or by defective fuze mechanisms. A 105 mm artillery round was detonated 2.6 m underground, and hydraulic conductivity measurements were taken before and after the explosion. A total of 114 hydraulic conductivity measurements were obtained within a radius of 3 m from the detonation point, at four different depths and at three different time periods separated by 18 months. This data was used to produce a three dimensional numerical model of the soil affected by the exploding artillery round. This model was then used to investigate potential changes to aquifer recharge and contaminant transport caused by the detonating round. The results indicate that an exploding artillery round can strongly affect the hydraulic conductivity in the vadose zone, increasing it locally by over an order of magnitude. These variations, however, appear to cause relatively small changes to both local groundwater recharge and contaminant transport. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84872788794"

Explosives contain these toxic and mutagenic xenobiotics, which are stable in the environment and recalcitrant to remediation. Certain technologies used thus far (incineration, adsorption, advanced oxidations processes, chemical reduction etc.) have not only been very expensive but also caused additional environmental problems. During recent decades, the most popular technologies have been biotechnological methods, such as phytoremediation, which is relatively cheap, environmentally friendly, and a highly accepted solution by society. The most promising of these technologies is the usage of genetically modified plants, which combines the ability of bacterial genes to detoxify compounds with the phytoremediation benefits of plants.

Whilst the source of these shock waves was explored in the 1940's, no attempt was made to predict them. This paper describes the detonation of bare, cylindrical charges of PE4 (RDX binder 88/12%), mass 0.2 to 0.46â.kg and with a length to diameter ratio of 4 to 1. High speed camera footage showed (i) the formation of the separate, primary, shock waves from the sides and ends of the charge, (ii) Mach reflection of these separate shock waves, giving rise to reflected, secondary shock waves, and (iii) the secondary shock waves catching and merging with the primary shock wave. In the axial direction, the secondary shock wave's peak overpressure and impulse exceeded that of the primary shock wave for scaled distances, Z=R/M1/3 ≥3.9 m kg-1/3, where M is the mass in kg and R the distance from the charge in m. It was found possible to predict the primary peak overpressure, P, at all distances in the axial direction, for a constant length to diameter ratio, using P=3075 Z-3-1732 Z-2+305 Z-1. Close in the primary peak overpressure is proportional to M/R3 in the axial direction. It was not possible to predict the secondary peak overpressure with the data obtained.

These rates were often an order of magnitude more rapid than those for RDX and two orders more than HMX. During average or high stream flow, TNT incorporation was most rapid at the riverine end member and generally decreased with increasing salinity. This pattern was not seen during low flow periods.

Scientific studies have however shown that TNT is susceptible to microbial transformation. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of a previously bioremediated hydrocarbon contaminated soil (PBR) to increase TNT degradation rates. This was investigated by adding TNT chips to PBR and uncontaminated soils (PNC) in laboratory based studies (up to 16 weeks). Residual TNT chip analysis showed greater TNT degradation in PBR soils (70%) and significantly higher metabolic rates (4.5 fold increase in cumulative CO2 levels) than in PNC soils (30%). Molecular analysis (PCR-DGGE-cluster analysis) showed substantial shifts in soil microbial communities associated with TNT contamination between day 0 and week 4 especially in PBR soils. Bacterial communities appeared to be more sensitive to TNT contamination than fungal communities in both soils. Quantitative PCR analysis showed ~3 fold increase in the abundance of nitroreductase genes (pnrA) in PBR soils with a gradual reduction in community evenness (Pareto-Lorenz curves) in contrast to PNC soils. These results suggest that microbial response to TNT contamination was dependent on the history of soil use. The results also confirm that the microbial potential of waste soils such as PBR soil (usually disposed of via landfill) can be successfully used for accelerated TNT chip degradation. This promotes sustainable re-use of waste soils extending the life span of landfill sites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84862643000"

Method: Hospital and post mortem records for all UK servicemen sustaining penetrating battle injuries to the face or eye during the period 01 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were analysed. Results: Face and eye injuries were found in 391/1187 (33%) and 113/1187 (10%) of all battle-injured servicemen respectively. 27% of eye wounds from explosions resulted in blindness and a further 17% in significant permanently reduced visual acuity (<6/12). Those servicemen that chose not to wear Combat Eye Protection (CEP) were 36 times more likely to sustain an eye injury from explosive fragmentation than those that did. However only 36% of servicemen chose to wear CEP. 7 deaths could potentially have been prevented had the serviceman chosen to wear their CEP. The lower third of the face was most commonly injured (60%) followed by the upper third (24%). CEP reduced facial injuries as a whole (bone and soft tissue) by 15% (p < 0.01). Potentially changing the existing material used for chinstrap and helmet covers to that with ballistic protection would further reduce this incidence by up to 9%. Conclusions: Although the lower third of the face remains poorly protected, the incidence of lower facial wounds could be further reduced by the use of ballistic visors by servicemen in exposed positions in vehicles (which represented 16% of facial injuries). Such a visor could potentially have prevented 17 deaths. A rigid attachment to the front of a ballistic helmet would allow either a visor, a high visibility LED lamp or a night vision goggle to clip in and we believe this capability should be investigated through future human factor trials.

Previous studies have shown MNX to be the most acutely toxic among the nitroreduced degradation products of RDX and to cause mild anemia at high dose. The present study compares hematotoxicity with acute oral exposure to MNX with parent RDX. Both RDX and MNX caused a modest decrease in blood hemoglobin and ~50% loss of granulocytes (NOAELs=47mg/kg) in female Sprague-Dawley rats observed 14days post-exposure. We explored the possibility that blood cell loss observed after 14days was delayed in onset because of toxicity to bone marrow (BM) progenitors. RDX and MNX decreased granulocyte/macrophage-colony forming cells (GM-CFCs) at 14, but not 7, days (NOAELs=24mg/kg). The earliest observed time at which MNX decreased GM-CFCs was 10days post-exposure. RDX and MNX likewise decreased BM burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-Es) at 14, but not 7, days. Granulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte (GEMM)-CFCs were unaffected by RDX and MNX at 7days suggesting precursor depletion did not account for GM-CFC and BFU-E loss. MNX added to the culture media was without effect on GM-CFC formation indicating no direct inhibition. Flow cytometry showed no differential loss of BM multilineage progenitors (Thy1.1+) or erythroid (CD71+) precursors with MNX suggesting myeloid and erythroid lineages were comparably affected.

To help predict the environmental behavior and fate of FOX-12, we conducted a study to determine its photodegradability and biodegradability. When dissolved in water, FOX-12, a guanylurea-dinitramide salt, also named GUDN, dissociated instantly to produce the dinitramide moiety and guanylurea, as demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. When an aqueous solution of FOX-12 was subjected to photolysis using a solar-simulated photoreactor, we found a rapid removal of the dinitramide with concurrent formation of N 2O, NO2-, and NO3-. The second component, guanylurea, was photostable. However, when FOX-12 was incubated aerobically with the soil isolate Variovorax strain VC1 and protected from light, the dinitramide component of FOX-12 was recalcitrant but guanylurea degraded effectively to ammonia, guanidine, and presumably CO2. When FOX-12 was incubated with strain VC1 in the presence of light, both components of FOX-12 degraded, giving similar products to those described above.

We identified common behavioral deficits and gene expression regulations, in addition to unique injury-specific forms of gene regulation. Molecular pathways presented a pattern similar to that seen in gene expression. Interestingly, pathways connected to Alzheimer's disease displayed a markedly different form of regulation depending on the type of TBI. While these data highlight similarities in behavioral outcomes after trauma, the divergence in hippocampal transcriptome observed between models suggests that, at the molecular level, the TBIs are quite different. These models may provide tools to help define therapeutic approaches for the treatment of physical- and blast-TBIs. Based upon observations of increasing numbers of personnel displaying TBI related emotional and behavioral changes in militarized zones, the development of efficacious therapies will become a national if not a global priority. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-84875244671"

Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of 144 patients who underwent whole-body CT angiography in March 2011 was made. A vascular radiologist reviewed all images and imaging reports. Data gathered included positive findings from CT, anatomical region injured, mechanism of injury, time to CT, and the number of casualties per incident. Results: One hundred and forty-four patients underwent whole-body CT of which 17% had an occult vascular injury on CT. Twenty of these injuries (56%) were in the lower limbs, excluding extravasation at the site of amputation. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) accounted for 71% (180 of 253) of battle injuries. The median time from admission to CT was 28 min. An additional 12% longer per patient is taken on average in a multiple casualty incident. Including contrast medium administration, whole-body angiography is completed in less than 2 min (mean 116 s). Conclusion: A significant proportion of occult vascular injuries occur in penetrating fragmentation and blast injuries in military trauma. A low threshold for single-pass whole-body CT angiography is therefore justified. © 2012 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84871316608"

Meisenheimer complex formation between the QD surface attached methionine and aromatic explosive molecules has helped to detect them selectively via a fluorescent quenching process. Fluorescence quenching occurred because of the transfer of excited electrons from QD to the explosive molecules.

This analysis helps in understanding the nature of data obtained from experiments and in making efficient estimators for the detection of explosives.

Electronic noses, based on metal oxide semiconductors (MOS), are a promising technology for creating inexpensive, portable and sensitive devices for such a purpose. An array of seven MOS gas sensors was fabricated by screen printing, based on WO3 and In 2O3 inks. The sensors were tested against six gases, including four explosive markers: nitromethane, DMNB (2,3-dimetheyl-2,3- dinitrobutane), 2-ethylhexanol and ammonia. The gases were successfully detected with good sensitivity and selectivity from the array. Sensitivity was improved by overlaying or admixing the oxides with two zeolites, H-ZSM-5 and TS-1, and each showed improved responses to -NO2 and -OH moieties respectively. Admixtures in particular showed promise, with excellent sensitivity and good stability to humidity.

The current models for describing the dissolution are subject to limitations in either model applicability or generality. This study attempted to develop a general model that is applicable to various types of energetic residues. Experimental data that were acquired from previous reports were used for testing the developed model. The results showed that the model captured well the dissolution processes of different types of energetic residues: 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), Tritonal, Composition B, Octol, and Greener Insensitive Material (GIM).

They also concluded that one of the mines deployed by the South Korean Navy many years ago in the area and then abandoned sank the ship. Their mine theory that is based on the explosive charge weights they calculated by means of two methods using the bubble period determined by their analysis, however, appears to be invalid. Although the incident had occurred in a shallow sea with a depth of less than 50m, the authors used the methods that are applicable only to free-field underwater explosions. The consideration of the influence on the bubble period of the nearby sea surface and bottom and the nearby ship's hull would double the calculated weights.

One of them is aluminum-containing white powder found in large quantities at certain substrates in the retrieved Cheonan.

Bobwhite were exposed to 4A-DNT at 0, 8, 15, 30, 60, or 150 mg/kg body weight (bw) d by oral gavage for seven days; because the high dose of 4A-DNT was lethal to bobwhite, the maximum dose was changed to 100 mg/kg bw d for Japanese quail and finches to ensure tissue could be used for future toxicogenomic work. RDX was similarly administered at 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg bw d. Blood was drawn prior to euthanasia for blood cellularity and chemistry analyses. Finches were clearly least affected by 4A-DNT as evidenced by a lack of observable effects. Bobwhite appeared to be the most sensitive species to 4A-DNT as observed through changes in blood cellularity and plasma chemistry effects. Bobwhite appeared to be more sensitive to RDX than Japanese Quail due to increased effects on measures of plasma chemistries. Finches exhibited the greatest sensitivity to RDX through increased mortality and seizure activity.

The DDT response characteristics for PBX-2 with 53% and 99% of theoretical maximum density (TMD) were evaluated by different shell thickness confinements at ambient temperature and at 85°C. The test results with different densities, confinements and temperatures exhibited a wide range of reaction violence. Firstly, at both ambient temperature and at 85°C under 10 and 20 mm shell thickness confinement, PBX-2 did not undergo fully DDT at 99% TMD, only a low velocity detonation (LVD) occurred. Secondly, PBX-2 at 53% TMD underwent DDT, and significant influence on the minimum run distance to detonation by the shell confinement thickness was observed. Strong confinement is favorable for the transition of DDT but the confinement does not influence reaction degree. Thirdly, the reaction degree of PBX-2 at 85°C was remarkably lower than that at ambient temperature.

Furthermore, biodegradation kinetics of the compounds was investigated in sequencing batch reactors both in the presence of glucose (co-substrate) and with nitrophenol as the sole carbon source. Among the three tested compounds, 3-NP showed the best biodegradability while 2,6-DNP was the most difficult to be biodegraded. The Haldane equation was applied to the kinetic test data of the nitrophenols.

At high (1320-2000mgL-1) glucose concentrations, the degradation rate of 3-NP was reduced and the Kmax of 3-NP was even lower than the value obtained in the absence of glucose, suggesting that high concentrations of co-substrate could inhibit 3-NP biodegradation.

The accumulation of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the shoots of all nine plant species remained below the Swiss tolerance values for fodder plants (150 mg kg-1 Zn, 15-35 mg kg-1 Cu, 40 mg kg-1 Pb, and 1 mg kg-1 Cd DW), with the only exception of Pb in Chenopodium album shoots which reached a concentration of 62 mg kg-1 DW. Antimony concentrations were 1.5-2.6-fold higher in plants growing on the calcareous soil than on the weakly acidic soil. Considering Cu, Zn, Pb, Sb and Cd, all plants, with the exception C. album, would be suitable for grazing on similar shooting range soils. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84861698338"

Although we discuss the chemical, explosive, and biological threat in relation to terrorism, explosives remain the weapons of choice because they have low technological and economic requirements. While there are feeble efforts to prevent people from becoming terrorists and larger efforts to prevent people from making bombs, major governmental resources have been aimed at finding bombs of unknown materials, put together in unknown fashion, and placed in unknown locations. From person-borne to vehicle-borne activities, law enforcement and counter-terrorism personnel have seen no end of threat situations. An overview of the history, existing practices, and potential future techniques of explosive detection will be presented in this paper. Emphasis will be given to technologies presently used in forensics and airport screening, including detection of bulk quantities and trace amounts. Despite almost thirty years of development only a few technologies have made it to wide-scale use. X-ray remains the principal bulk detection technology, while ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) retains a favored position in trace technologies and standoff detection has yet to find a front runner. Sample collection remains a challenge. In the past we have been surprised by terrorist attacks involving Semtex, urea nitrate, ammonium nitrate, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), hydrogen peroxide, and chlorates.

An understanding of the postblast explosive particle morphology would provide vital information during forensic examinations, allowing rapid initial indication of the explosive material to be microscopically determined prior to any chemical analyses and thereby saving time and resources at the crucial stage of an investigation. In this study, condensed phase particles collected from around the detonations of aluminized ammonium nitrate and RDX-based explosive charges were collected in a novel manner utilizing SEM stubs. By incorporating the use of a focused ion beam during analysis, for the first time it is possible to determine that such particles have characteristic shapes, sizes, and internal structures depending on the explosive and the distance from the detonation at which the particles are recovered. Spheroidal particles (10-210 μm) with microsurface features recovered following inorganic charge detonations were dissimilar to the irregularly shaped particles (5-100 μm) recovered following organic charge firings. Confirmatory analysis to conclude that the particles were indeed explosive included HPLC-MS, Raman spectroscopy, and mega-electron volt-secondary ionization mass spectrometry. These results may impact not only forensic investigations but also the theoretical constructs that govern detonation theory by indicating the potential mechanisms by which these particles survive and how they vary between the different explosive types.

Rapid reaction rates make the detonation mechanisms of HEDMs difficult to understand, so computational tools are used to predict trigger bonds - weak bonds that break, leading to detonation. Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) have been used to compare bond densities in HEDMs to reference molecules to provide a relative scale for the bond strength to predict the activated bonds most likely to break to trigger an explosion. This analysis confirms that X-NO2 (X=N,C,O) bonds are trigger linkages in common HEDMs such as TNT, RDX and PETN, consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. Calculations on a small test set of substituted tetrazoles show that the assignment of the trigger bond depends upon the functionality of the material and that the relative weakening of the bond correlates with experimental impact sensitivities. Pull the trigger: Trigger bonds in explosive materials are proposed to break to initiate detonation. These bonds may be predicted using Wiberg bond indices as a measure of bond strength when compared in reference molecules.

The presence of ferrihydrite in the culture medium decreased the rate of TNT biotransformation but resulted in the accumulation of the same TNT metabolites as in the absence of ferrihydrite, albeit at slightly different concentrations. Transformation products observed included aromatic ring reduction products, such as hydride-Meisenheimer complexes, and nitro group reduction products, such as hydroxylamino- and amino-dinitrotoluenes. Independently of the presence of ferrihydrite the subsequent degradation of the hydride complex(es) resulted in the release of nitrite followed by its conversion to nitrate and nitric oxide at the low pH values observed during yeast cultivation. Nitric oxide generation was ascertained by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. In addition, increased Fe3+-reduction was observed in the presence of TNT and Y. lipolytica. This study demonstrates that in the presence of yeast cells, TNT-hydride complexes were formed at approximately the same level as in the presence of ferrihydrite, opening up the possibility of aromatic ring cleavage, instead of promoting the production of potentially toxic nitro group reduction products in the presence of iron minerals. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84880933909"

We developed a procedure for compound-specific analysis of stable C, N, and H isotopes in nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) and characterized biodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and two dinitrotoluene isomers (2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT) in subsurface material of a contaminated site. The type and relative contribution of reductive and oxidative pathways to the degradation of the three contaminants was inferred from the combined evaluation of C, N, and H isotope fractionation. Indicative trends of Δδ15N vs Δδ13C and Δδ2H vs Δδ13C were obtained from laboratory model systems for biodegradation pathways initiated via (i) dioxygenation, (ii) reduction, and (iii) CH3-group oxidation. The combined evaluation of NAC isotope fractionation in subsurface materials and in laboratory experiments suggests that in the field, 86-89% of 2,4-DNT transformation was due to dioxygenation while TNT was mostly reduced and 2,6-DNT reacted via a combination of reduction and CH3-group oxidation. Based on historic information on site operation, our data imply biodegradation of 2,4-DNT with half-lives of up to 9-17 years compared to 18-34 years for cometabolic transformation of TNT and 2,6-DNT. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84880129665"

MCM-41 silica was used as an inorganic scaffold and pyrene (P derivative containing trialkoxysilane moieties), dansyl and fluorescein (D and F derivatives also containing trialkoxysilane groups, respectively) fluorophores have been anchored on hybrid materials by a co-condensation method to obtain a homogenous distribution of dyes into the pores of the support. Six sensing materials have been prepared, of which SP, SD, SF were hydrophilic and SPh, SDh, SFh were hydrophobic. Template-free hydrophilic materials (SP, SD, SF) were obtained after repeated NH4NO3/ethanol extractions under temperature from as-synthesised (MP, MD and MF supports, respectively) solids. Hydrophobic materials (SPh, SDh, SFh) were prepared by using excess 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane with template-free hydrophilic (SP, SD and SF) materials. The six final materials displayed the typical emission bands of the grafted fluorophores. In particular, SP and SPh show the typical pyrene monomer (370-420 nm) and excimer (430-600 nm) emissions. SD and SDh exhibit the broad dansyl fluorescence band in the 450-600 nm range, whereas solids SF and SFh present sharp fluorescein emission centred at 525 nm. The fluorescent behaviour of the six final materials was tested in the presence of explosives (pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), nitrobenzene (NB), 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (Tetryl) and picric acid (PA)). Only nitroaromatic compounds were able to induce emission quenching. As a general trend, the quenching degree depended on the nature of the final material. The best response was obtained with explosives PA and Tetryl, which were able to significantly quench the emission of the sensing supports. The observed quenching was ascribed to the π-π stacking interactions between the electron-donor fluorophores and the electron-withdrawing nitroaromatic explosives. When using SPh for Tetryl and PA, the limits of detection were 8.5 and 1.4 ppm, respectively, whereas they were 14.4 and 1.2 ppm for SDh. Principal component analysis algorithms were applied to the fluorescence measurements taken with the six hybrid materials and the seven explosives. The obtained score plot showed well-defined clusters for the seven explosives tested. Finally, solid SDh was applied to detect trace amounts of Tetryl in soil samples with good results.

The energetics in the soil were royal demolition explosive (RDX) and high-melting explosive (HMX). Among the 6 treatments employed in this study, enhanced removal of RDX was observed from treatments that received molasses and went to completion. The RDX degradation rates in treatments with molasses diluted 1:20 and 1:40 were comparable suggesting that the lower dose worked as well as the higher dose. Treatments without molasses degraded RDX slowly and residuals remained after 15 weeks. The bacterial densities in molasses-treated units were much greater than those without molasses. Phytoremediation alone seems to have little effect on RDX disappearance. For HMX, neither bioremediation nor phytoremediation was found to be useful in reducing the concentration within the experimental period. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil did not change significantly during the experiment, however, a slight increase in soil pH was observed in all treatments. The study showed that irrigating with diluted molasses is effective at enhancing RDX degradation mainly in the root zone and just below it.

As SPME successfully integrates a number of analytical steps such as sampling, extraction, preconcentration, and sample introduction for instrumental analysis, which are both laborious and time consuming, making the sample preparation and instrumental analysis relatively faster, SPME has gained enormous popularity among forensic scientists in recent years. Recent trends in the advancement of the extraction process including novel fiber coatings and in vivo sampling applications are described and a detailed discussion on important chemical analysis needed in the forensic laboratory for use in criminal investigations is presented. Highlights of the SPME process encompass recent novel applications such as the detection of chemical warfare agents and the identification of volatile organic signatures of live human scent for potential biometric measurements.

The results showed that COD removal increased with increasing resin dosage and temperature. When the resin dosage was 120 g L-1, 92.49% COD can be removed after 8 h of adsorption at 30 C. The adsorption of COD on resin was coincident with Langmuir isotherm. The change in Gibbs free energy ΔG was -4.843, -5.468 and -5.833 kJ mol-1, respectively, when the temperature was 30, 40 and 50 C, indicating that the adsorption was spontaneous.

There are several tools employed by law enforcement to detect explosives, but these can be subverted. Active neutron interrogation is a viable alternative to those techniques, and includes: fast neutron analysis, thermal neutron analysis, pulsed fast/thermal neutron analysis, neutron elastic scatter, and fast neutron radiography. These methods vary based on neutron energy and radiation detected.

The second generation TNA detector is being developed with a number of improvements aimed at increasing sensitivity and facilitating ease of operation. Among these are an electronic neutron generator to increase sensitivity for deeper and horizontally displaced explosives; LaBr3(Ce) scintillators, to improve time response and energy resolution; improved thermal and electronic stability; improved sensor head geometry to minimize spatial response nonuniformity; and more robust data processing. The sensor is described, with emphasis on the improvements.

Four different solvent mixtures containing acetonitrile or methanol were tested at variable extraction ratios to compare the extraction efficiency for six explosive compounds: 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT), and 2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN), in Laurel Willow (Salix pentandra) stem and range grass Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) using LC-MS/MS. Plant tissues were spiked with 500 ng/g of explosives and extracted using ultrasonically-assisted solvent extraction. With the ratio of fresh plant mass to solvent volume of 1:20 for willow and 1:40 for big bluestem grass, results indicated that all explosives in willow except HMX were extracted at higher than 73.3% by using 20 mL of methanol, 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water, or acetonitrile, whereas HMX was extracted with the highest recovery of 61.3% by 20 mL of acetonitrile. In big bluestem grass, the most effective solvents were 20 mL of either methanol or 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water for PETN extraction with a recovery of higher than 101.2% and 20 mL of 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water for HMX, RDX, TNT, 2ADNT, and DNAN extraction with a recovery of 83.8%, 104.4%, 97.5%, 80.7%, and 108.2%, respectively. However, unlike methanol and acetonitrile, 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water provided no problem of leading or split peak in chromatogram; therefore, it was preferred in the test and performed a method validation. Results indicated that 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water provided good repeatability and recovery and method detection limits at 0.5-20 ng/g fresh weight or 8.8-61.3 ng/g dry weight.

Knowledge of the microbial dynamics driving TNT biodegradation is limited, particularly in native aquifer sediments where it poses a threat to water resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of organic amendments on anaerobic TNT biodegradation rate and pathway in an enrichment culture obtained from historically contaminated aquifer sediment and to compare the bacterial community dynamics. TNT readily biodegraded in all microcosms, with the highest biodegradation rate obtained under the lactate amended condition followed by ethanol amended and naturally occurring organic matter (extracted from site sediment) amended conditions. Although a reductive pathway of TNT degradation was observed across all conditions, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed distinct bacterial community compositions. In all microcosms, Gram-negative γ- or β-Proteobacteria and Gram-positive Negativicutes or Clostridia were observed. A Pseudomonas sp. in particular was observed to be stimulated under all conditions. According to non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of DGGE profiles, the microcosm communities were most similar to heavily TNT-contaminated field site sediment, relative to moderately and uncontaminated sediments, suggesting that TNT contamination itself is a major driver of microbial community structure. Overall these results provide a new line of evidence of the key bacteria driving TNT degradation in aquifer sediments and their dynamics in response to organic carbon amendment, supporting this approach as a promising technology for stimulating in situ TNT bioremediation in the subsurface. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-84874577817"

These previous papers showed that an alternative equation for casing-modified blast impulse could be derived directly from an equation by Gurney [6] for the kinetic energy balance between the mass of casing metal and the mass of explosive gases. However, this equation was derived for very ductile casings that are accelerated to their ideal Gurney velocity before they fracture. A previous paper [3] showed how the finite fracture strain of real casing metal can be taken into account in determining the relative blast impulse from a cased charge. This paper shows how, based on previous work by Taylor [7], the equation in [2] can instead be modified to allow for the yield stress of the casing metal and provides validation for this further equation from available experimental data. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To understand the interactions of blast waves on the head and brain and to identify the mechanisms of injury, compression-driven air shock tubes are extensively used in laboratory settings to simulate the field conditions. The overall goal of this effort is to understand the mechanics of blast wave-head interactions as the blast wave traverses the head/brain continuum. Toward this goal, surrogate head model is subjected to well-controlled blast wave profile in the shock tube environment, and the results are analyzed using combined experimental and numerical approaches. The validated numerical models are then used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of stresses and pressure in the human skull and brain. By detailing the results from a series of careful experiments and numerical simulations, this paper demonstrates that: (1) Geometry of the head governs the flow dynamics around the head which in turn determines the net mechanical load on the head. (2) Biomechanical loading of the brain is governed by direct wave transmission, structural deformations, and wave reflections from tissue-material interfaces. (3) Deformation and stress analysis of the skull and brain show that skull flexure and tissue cavitation are possible mechanisms of blast-induced traumatic brain injury. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-84878682500"

This is a retrospective analysis of initial management for IED blast injuries presenting with bilateral, traumatic, lower-extremity (LE) amputations with and without pelvic and perineal involvement. Methods: A database of trauma admissions presenting to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Role 3 combat hospital in southern Afghanistan over a 7-month period was created to evaluate the care of this particular injury pattern. Patients were included if they were received from point of injury with at least bilateral traumatic LE amputations and had vital signs with initial resuscitation efforts. Results: Thirty-two presented with double LE amputations (36%) and nine with triple amputations (10%). After excluding 10 patients who failed to meet the inclusion criteria, 22 patients were analysed. The mean age was 29 years, and the average ISS and admission haemoglobin were 22 and 11.3 mg l-1, respectively. Patients received an average of 54 units of blood products and underwent 1.6 operations with a mean operative time of 142.5 min. The pattern of injury was associated with an increase in the total blood products required for resuscitation (pelvis n = 12, p = 0.028, gastrointestinal tract (GI) n = 14, p = 0.02, perineal n = 15, p = 0.036). There was no relationship between ISS or admission haemoglobin and the need for massive transfusion. Low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was associated with increased 30-day mortality. Hollow viscus injury and operative hemipelvectomy were also associated with mortality. Conclusions: Early 30-day follow-up demonstrated that IED injuries with bilateral LE amputations with and without pelvic and perineal involvement are survivable injuries. Standard measures of injury and predictors of survival bore little relationship to observed outcomes and may need to be re-evaluated. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess the extent of functional recovery and overall morbidity and mortality.© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84865500835"

We tested the effectiveness of compost and mineral treatments for remediation and revegetation of military range soil collected in Aberdeen, MD. The soil was barren due to zinc (Zn) phytotoxicity while lead (Pb) posed a substantial risk to soil biota, wildlife and humans through various pathways. Seven treatments were tested: untreated control, agricultural NPK fertilization, high phosphate fertilization plus agricultural rates of NK, CaCO3, "" Orgro"" biosolid compost, "" Orgro"" + CaCO3, "" Orgro"" + CaCO3 + Mn sulfate.

Considering contact deformation, friction and chemical reactions at the particle level during the impact loading process, three hot-spot sources are included, namely, the micro-particle contact deformation between two equal-sized particles with no relative sliding, the contact sites between the impacting surface and the particles, and the contacting zone between particles with a sliding velocity along the maximum shear-stress direction. Drop-weight impacts on samples composed of equal-sized particle layers are considered. The temperature rise due to plastic and frictional dissipation is estimated, and melting is included. Hot spot ignition is predicted via thermal explosion, using an Arrhenius thermochemical model. The effects of drop height and particle size on the ignition processes are analyzed. The hot-spot sources at the interface between the particles and the impacting surfaces play the most important role during the early ignition stage. The time-to-ignition of the three sources increases with decreasing drop height. Calculated results show that the HMX and PETN crystals demonstrate monotonously increasing time-to-ignition with a reduction in particle size. The effect of particlesize on the hot spot ignition threshold can be predicted. Samples with a smaller particle size undergo larger localized deformations and lower average pressures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-80054106462"

DNT has been found in soil, surface water, and groundwater near ammunition production plants. The major isomers of DNT are classified as "" likely to cause cancer in humans."" In vitro studies have provided conflicting data regarding the genotoxicity of the minor isomers. Studies indicate that metabolism in the gut and liver are necessary to convert DNT to genotoxic compounds. As such, in the present study the genotoxicity of isomers of DNT was assessed using two in vivo genotoxicity assays. The Comet assay was used to detect DNA damage in liver cells from male Sprague-Dawley rats following oral exposure (14-day) to individual isomers of DNT. The micronucleus assay was conducted using flow cytometric analysis to detect chromosomal damage in peripheral blood. Treatment with 2,3-, 3,4-, 2,4-, 2,5- and 3,5-DNT did not induce DNA damage in liver cells or increase the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) in peripheral blood at the doses tested. Treatment with 2,6-DNT induced DNA damage in liver tissue at all doses tested, but did not increase the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) in peripheral blood. Thus, 2,4-DNT and the minor isomers were not genotoxic under these test conditions, while 2,6-DNT was genotoxic in the target tissue, the liver. These results support previous research which indicated that the hepatocarcinogenicity of technical grade DNT (TG-DNT) could be attributed to the 2,6-DNT isomer. © 2011.","2-s2.0-84856086497"

Reactors R1, R2 and R3 were fed with 200. mg/L concentration of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (2,4,6-TNP) whereas reactor R was used as a background control. Three nitrophenolic shock loadings of 400, 600 and 800. mg/L. d were administrated by increasing the influent nitrophenolic concentration while keeping the hydraulic retention time as 48. h. The shocks were given continuously for a period of 4 days before switching back to normal nitrophenolic loading (200. mg/L. d). The reactors were allowed to recover to normal performance level before administrating the next nitrophenolic shock load. The study showed that a nitrophenolic shock load, as high as 600. mg/L. d was completely degraded by the 4-NP & 2,4-DNP bioreactors while almost half degraded by the 2,4,6-TNP bioreactor without affecting the reactor's performance irreversibly.

It is noteworthy that the nitrotoluene contaminants could be almost completely eliminated by virtue of sono-activated persulfate oxidation, wherein sulfate radicals serve as principal oxidants, of which amounts are significantly enhanced via addition of sodium sulfate. Based on the results given by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), it is postulated that the methyl group of DNTs preliminarily underwent oxidation pathway into dinitrobenzoic acid, followed by decarboxylation to form 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB).

Little is known about the fate of DNAN and its transformation products in the natural environment. Here we report aerobic biotransformation of DNAN in artificially contaminated soil microcosms. DNAN was completely transformed in 8 days in soil slurries supplemented with carbon and nitrogen sources. DNAN was completely transformed in 34 days in slurries supplemented with carbons alone and persisted in unamended microcosms. A strain of Bacillus (named 13G) that transformed DNAN by co-metabolism was isolated from the soil. HPLC and LC-MS analyses of cell-free and resting cell assays of Bacillus 13G with DNAN showed the formation of 2-amino-4-nitroanisole as the major end-product via the intermediary formation of the arylnitroso (ArNO) and arylhydroxylamino (ArNHOH) derivatives, indicating regioselective reduction of the ortho-nitro group. A series of secondary reactions involving ArNO and ArNHOH gave the corresponding azoxy- and azo-dimers. Acetylated and demethylated products were identified.

In fact, this quantity (known as odor availability) depends not only on the amount of explosive material, but also the container volume, explosive vapor pressure and temperature. In order to better understand odor availability, headspace experiments were conducted and the results were compared to theory. The vapor-phase concentrations of three liquid explosives (nitromethane, nitroethane and nitropropane) were predicted using the Ideal Gas Law for containers of various volumes that are in use for canine testing. These predictions were verified through experiments that varied the amount of sample, the container size, and the temperature. These results demonstrated that the amount of sample that is needed to saturate different sized containers is small, predictable and agrees well with theory. In general, and as expected, once the headspace of a container is saturated, any subsequent increase in sample volume will not result in the release of more vapors. The ability of canines to recognize and alert to differing amounts of nitromethane has also been studied. In particular, it was found that the response of trained canines is independent of the amount of nitromethane present, provided it is a sufficient quantity to saturate the container in which it is held. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84862682569"

Capacity to catabolize and mineralize TNT ring carbon to CO 2 was a common feature of natural sediment assemblages from these coastal environments (ranging to 270+/-38 μg C kg -1 d -1). More importantly, these mineralization rates comprised a significant proportion of total heterotrophic production. The finding that most natural assemblages surveyed from these ecosystems can mineralize TNT ring carbon to CO 2 is consistent with recent reports that assemblage components can incorporate TNT ring carbon into bacterial biomass.

The expense associated with cleanup of land previously used for military training and war provides impetus for research towards enhanced discrimination of buried unexploded ordnance. Towards reducing that expense, a multiaxis electromagnetic induction data collection and software system, called ALLTEM, was designed and tested with support from the U.S. Department of Defense Environmental Security Technology Certification Program. ALLTEM is an on-time time-domain system that uses a continuous triangle-wave excitation to measure the target-step response rather than traditional impulse response. The system cycles through three orthogonal transmitting loops and records a total of 19 different transmitting and receiving loop combinations with a nominal spatial data sampling interval of 20 cm. Recorded data are pre-processed and then used in a hybrid discrimination scheme involving both data-driven and numerical classification techniques. The data-driven classification scheme is accomplished in three steps. First, field observations are used to train a type of unsupervised artificial neural network, a self-organizing map (SOM). Second, the SOM is used to simultaneously estimate target parameters (depth, azimuth, inclination, item type and weight) by iterative minimization of the topographic error vectors. Third, the target classification is accomplished by evaluating histograms of the estimated parameters. The numerical classification scheme is also accomplished in three steps. First, the Biot-Savart law is used to model the primary magnetic fields from the transmitter coils and the secondary magnetic fields generated by currents induced in the target materials in the ground. Second, the target response is modelled by three orthogonal dipoles from prolate, oblate and triaxial ellipsoids with one long axis and two shorter axes. Each target consists of all three dipoles. Third, unknown target parameters are determined by comparing modelled to measured target responses. By comparing the rms error among the self-organizing map and numerical classification results, we achieved greater than 95per cent detection and correct classification of the munitions and explosives of concern at the direct fire and indirect fire test areas at the UXO Standardized Test Site at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 2010. © 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2012 RAS.","2-s2.0-84863781840"

Characterizing surface soils for energetic contamination has been conducted extensively in the past. However, deriving mass deposition rates on soils for specific munition-related activities, necessary for determining the cumulative impact of these activities and developing range sustainability models, has been problematic. Factors include determining the energetic residues deposition area, discriminating current deposition from previous activities, separating the residues from the collection matrix, and processing the samples. To circumvent these problems, methods were developed for sampling energetic residues on clean snow surfaces. At firing points, a clean snow surface allows the collection of propellant residues from a known quantity and type of munition. Explosives residues from projectile detonations can be sampled from clean snow- and ice-covered surfaces in active impact areas. Sampling protocols have been optimized and quality assurance procedures have been developed during years of research on munition residues deposition rates. These methods are currently being used in the US, Canada, and Norway for both energetics and metal contaminants with other applications under consideration.

This growing threat highlights the importance of understanding and evaluating blast injury risk and the increase of injury risk from exposure to repeated blast effects. METHODS: Data from more than 3,250 large animal experiments were collected from studies focusing on the effects of blast exposure. The current study uses 2,349 experiments from the data collection for analysis of the primary blast injury and survival risk for both long- and short-duration blasts, including the effects from repeated exposures. A piecewise linear logistic regression was performed on the data to develop survival and injury risk assessment curves. RESULTS: New injury risk assessment curves uniting long- and short-duration blasts were developed for incident and reflected pressure measures and were used to evaluate the risk of injury based on blast overpressure, positive-phase duration, and the number of repeated exposures. The risk assessments were derived for three levels of injury severity: nonauditory, pulmonary, and fatality. The analysis showed a marked initial decrease in injury tolerance with each subsequent blast exposure. This effect decreases with increasing number of blast exposures. CONCLUSIONS: The new injury risk functions showed good agreement with the existing experimental data and provided a simplified model for primary blast injury risk. This model can be used to predict blast injury or fatality risk for single exposure and repeated exposure cases and has application in modern combat scenarios or in setting occupational health limits.

TNT and other explosives can be degraded by microorganisms; however, biostimulation is needed for process efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of using biostimulation to degrade TNT, we added varying concentrations of a nutrient amendment consisting of inorganic salts, plant extracts, and molasses to soil and liquid media. For the inoculum we used a consortium of bacteria AM 06 that had exhibited the ability to degrade TNT and which had been previously isolated from explosives-contaminated soils. Phylogenetically, the clones clustered into seven different genera: Klebsiella, Raoultella, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Achromobacter and Pseudomonas. The addition of AM 06 consortium to a liquid environment along with 100% nutrient amendment decreased the amount of TNT (and its degradation products) by up to 90% after 14 days incubation. At the total amount of TNT was less than 100mg/l, the concentration of TNT did not influence the amount of sugar consumed by the bacteria consortium. In soil media, the TNT degradation process was dependent on the concentration of nutrient amendment added. At higher initial concentrations of TNT (500mg/kg), bioaugmentation (i.e., addition of bacteria inoculum) had a demonstrated effect, especially when nutrient concentrations of 50% and 100% were added to the soil. Findings of this study could further the understanding of the TNT biodegradation processes in water and soil and provide for optimization of the technological conditions for bioremediation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84855783381"

Dissolution of these compounds is usually the first step prior to their spreading in subsurface environments. Nevertheless, dissolution of individual TNT, RDX, and HMX under continuous flow conditions has not been well investigated. This study applied spectral confocal microscopy to observe and quantify the dissolution of TNT, RDX, and HMX (<100. μm crystals) in micromodel channels. Dissolution models were developed to describe the changes of their radii, surface areas, volumes, and specific surface areas as a function of time. Results indicated that a model incorporating a resistance term that accounts for the surface area in direct contact with the channel surfaces (and hence, was not exposed to the flowing water) described the dissolution processes well. The model without the resistance term, however, could not capture the observed data at the late stage of TNT dissolution. The model-fitted mass transfer coefficients were in agreement with the previous reports. The study highlights the importance of including the resistance term in the dissolution model and illustrates the utility of the newly developed spectral imaging method for quantification of mass transfer of TNT, RDX, and HMX. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84859871748"

End points such as survival, growth, and reproduction are eco-toxicologically relevant but provide little mechanistic insight into toxicity pathways, especially at the molecular level. Here we apply a toxicogenomic approach to investigate the mode of action underlying the reversible neurotoxicity of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), a cyclic nitroamine explosives compound. We developed an E. fetida-specific shotgun microarray targeting 15119 unique E. fetida transcripts. Using this array we profiled gene expression in E. fetida in response to exposure to CL-20. Eighteen earthworms were exposed for 6 days to 0.2 μg/cm 2 of CL-20 on filter paper, half of which were allowed to recover in a clean environment for 7 days. Nine vehicle control earthworms were sacrificed at days 6 and 13, separately. Electrophysiological measurements indicated that the conduction velocity of earthworm medial giant nerve fiber decreased significantly after 6-day exposure to CL-20, but was restored after 7 days of recovery. Total RNA was isolated from the four treatment groups including 6-day control, 6-day exposed, 13-day control, and 13-day exposed (i.e., 6-day exposure followed by 7-day recovery), and was hybridized to the 15K shotgun oligo array. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses suggest that CL-20 initiated neurotoxicity by noncompetitively blocking the ligand-gated GABA A receptor ion channel, leading to altered expression of genes involved in GABAergic, cholinergic, and Agrin-MuSK pathways. In the recovery phase, expression of affected genes returned to normality, possibly as a result of autophagy and CL-20 dissociation/metabolism.

With increasing human interference (e.g. fisheries, aggregate extraction, harbor related activities), it forms a threat to the safety at sea. In this study, test mines were deployed on a sandy seabed for 3 months to investigate mine burial processes as a function of hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions. The mine experiment was conducted in a shallow (9m), macrotidal environment characterized by highly turbid waters (yearly and depth-averaged suspended particulate matter concentration of 100mgl-1). Results showed some variability of the overall mine burial, which corresponded with scouring processes induced by a (sub-) tidal forcing mechanism. The main burial events however were linked to storm-related scouring processes, and subsequent mine roll into the resulting pit. Two storms affecting the mines during the 3-month experiment resulted in enduring increases in burial volume to 60% and 80%, respectively. More cyclic and ephemeral burial and exposure events appear to be linked to the local hydrodynamic regime. During slack tides, suspended sediment settles on the seabed, increasing the burial volume. In between slack tides, sediment is resuspended, decreasing the burial volume. The temporal pattern of this never reported burial mechanism, as measured optically, mimics the cyclicity of the suspended sediment concentration as recorded by ultrasonic signals at a nearby benthic observatory. Given the similarity in response signals at the two sites, we hypothesize that the formation of high-concentrated mud suspensions (HCMS) is a mechanism causing short-term burial and exposure of mines. This short-term burial and exposure increase the chance that mines are 'missed' during tracking surveys. Test mines contribute to our understanding of the settling and erosion of HCMS, and thus shed a light on generic sedimentary processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84863437417"

These devices typically incorporate a polymer coating as an active layer that can bind the analytes of interest. Analyte adsorption causes a shift in the resonant frequency of the device proportional to the amount of adsorbedmaterial. Currently some of the polymer coatings used in these sensors utilize hydrogen bonding to adsorb analytes. Dipole-dipole type interactions can also be utilized to promote interaction of the analytes with the polymer coating. Polymer coating containing segments that have a permanent molecular dipole can interact with explosive taggants. In this study, novel polypropylene glycol based polymers that incorporate both hydrogen bonding moieties and segments having large permanent dipole moment (p-nitroazobenzene functional groups) were synthesized and tested. The precursor polymer was prepared by the polymerization of the diglycidyl ether end functionalized polypropylene glycol macromer and aniline. The precursor polymers were post functionalized by an azo-coupling reaction. The sensor response to saturated vapors of o-nitrotoluene, nitrobenzene and 2,4 dinitrotoluene (DNT) saturated vapors was evaluated. Incorporation of p-nitroazobenzene moieties in the polymer increased the sensitivity of detection of the analytes.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an event-related stimulus-response compatibility task was used to compare 15 subjects with mild, chronic blast-related TBI with 15 subjects who had not experienced a TBI or blast exposure during deployment. Six TBI subjects reported multiple injuries. Relative to the control group, TBI subjects had slightly slower responses during fMRI and increased somatic complaints and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. A between-group analysis indicated greater activation during stimulus-response incompatibility in TBI subjects within the anterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal cortex, and posterior cerebral areas involved in visual and visual-spatial functions. This activation pattern was more extensive after statistically controlling for reaction time and symptoms of PTSD and depression. There was also a negative relationship between symptoms of PTSD and activation within posterior brain regions. These results provide evidence for increased task-related activation following mild, blast-related TBI and additional changes associated with emotional symptoms. Limitations of this study include no matching for combat exposure and different recruitment strategies so that the control group was largely a community-based sample, while many TBI subjects were seeking services.

Purpose: To characterize the effect of method of movement on and around the battlefield during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2001 to 2009 in terms of its impact on the incidence and severity of spinal fractures sustained in combat. Study design/setting: Retrospective study. Patient sample: Mounted and dismounted American servicemembers who were injured during combat. Methods: Extracted medical records of servicemembers identified in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry from October 2001 to December 2009. Methods of movement were defined as mounted or dismounted. Two time periods were compared. Cohorts were created for 2×2 analysis based on method of movement and the time period in which the injury occurred. Time period 1 and 2 were separated by April 1, 2007, which correlates with the initial fielding of the modern class of uparmored fighting vehicles with thickened underbelly armor and a V-shaped hull. Our four comparison groups were Dismounted in Time Period 1 (D1), Dismounted in Time Period 2 (D2), Mounted in Time Period 1 (M1), and Mounted in Time Period 2 (M2). Results: In total, 1,819 spine fractures occurred over the entire study period. Four hundred seventy-two fractures (26%) were sustained in 145 servicemembers who were mounted at the time of injury, and 1,347 (74%) were sustained by 404 servicemembers who were dismounted (p<.0005). The incidence of fractures in the dismounted cohort (D1+D2) was significantly higher than in the mounted cohort (M1+M2) in both time periods (D1 vs. M1, 13.75 vs. 3.95/10,000 warrior-years [p<.001] and D2 vs. M2, 11.15 vs. 4.89/10,000 warrior-years [p<.0001]). In both the mounted and dismounted groups, the thoracolumbar (TL) junction was the most common site of injury (36.1%). Fractures to the TL junction (T10-L3) increased significantly from Time Period 1 to 2 (34% vs. 40% of all fractures, respectively, p=.03). Thoracolumbar fractures were significantly more severe in that there were more Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Magerl Type A injuries versus all TL fractures, 1.75 versus 2.68/10,000 or 27% of all spine fractures in Time Period 1 versus 40% in Time Period 2 (p=.007). Furthermore, there were significantly fewer minor fractures (spinous process and transverse process fractures) (p<.0001). In Time Period 2, significantly more TL spine fractures were classified as major fractures, according to the Denis classification system, in both the mounted and dismounted groups; M1 group, 61 of 226 (27%) versus the M2 group, 86 of 246 (34%) (p<.0005) and 173 of 786 (22%) in the D1 group versus 193 of 561 (34%) in the D2 group. The spinal cord injury (SCI) incidence did not change in the mounted groups in Time Period 1 (7 of 71, 9.9%) versus Time Period 2 (7 of 74, 9.5%) (p=.935). In the dismounted groups, SCI actually decreased from D1 (55 of 228, 24%) to D2 (28 of 176, 16%) (p=.0428). Conclusions: The incidence of spine fractures and SCI is significantly higher in dismounted operations. The data suggest that current uparmored vehicles convey greater protection against spinal fracture compared with dismounted operations in which servicemembers are engaged on foot, outside their vehicles. The TL junction is at greatest risk for spine fractures sustained in mounted and dismounted combat operations. Recently, the incidence of TL fractures, especially severe fractures, has significantly increased in mounted operations. Although there has been an increased incidence of TL spine fractures, in context of the number of servicemembers deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom, these severe fractures still represent a relatively rare event. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we further characterized blast producing moderate traumatic brain injury and defined ""composite"" blast and primary blast exposure set-ups. Schlieren optics visualized interaction between the head and a shock wave generated by external shock tube, revealing strong head acceleration upon positioning the rat on-axis with the shock tube (composite blast), but negligible skull movement upon peak overpressure exposure off-axis (primary blast). Brain injury signatures of a primary blast hitting the frontal head were assessed and compared to damage produced by composite blast. Low to negligible levels of neurodegeneration were found following primary blast compared to composite blast by silver staining. However, persistent gliosis in hippocampus and accumulation of GFAP/CNPase in circulation was detected after both primary and composite blast. Also, markers of vascular/endothelial inflammation integrin alpha/beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and L-selectin along with neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor-beta were increased in serum within 6 h post-blasts and persisted for 7 days thereafter.

Methods: NZVI particles were simultaneously synthesized and stabilized by sodium borohydride reduction in a nondeoxygenated system. The morphology, elemental content, specific surface area, and crystal properties of the NZVI were characterized before and after the reaction by environmental scanning electron microscope; energy dispersive X-ray; Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller; and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The reduction process was conducted at pH = 6.3 at ambient temperature. The efficiency of the NZVI-mediated DNTS reduction process was monitored by HPLC, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Results: The properties of the NZVI particles prepared were found to be similar to those obtained through oxygen-free preparation and inert stabilization processes. Both 2,4-DNT-3-sulfonate (2,220 mg L-1) and 2,4-DNT-5-sulfonate (3,270 mg L-1) in TNT red water underwent a pseudo-first-order transformation when mixed with NZVI at room temperature and near-neutral pH. Their observed rate constants were 0.11 and 0.30 min-1, respectively. Within 1 h of processing, more than 99% of DNTS was converted by NZVI-mediated reduction into the corresponding diaminotoluene sulfonates. Conclusions: NZVI can be simultaneously prepared and stabilized in a nondeoxygenated system. NZVI reduction is a highly efficient method for the conversion of DNTS into the corresponding diaminotoluene sulfonates under near-neutral pH conditions. Therefore, NZVI reduction may be useful in the treatment of TNT red water and subsequent recovery of diaminotoluene from explosive wastewater. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-84864089008"

En route to developing a model of repeated exposure to BOP we sought to initially characterize the effects of acute BOP exposure in rodents, focusing specifically on the levels of BOP exposure that produced clinical mTBI symptoms. We first measured BOP effects on gross motor function on a balance beam. Separate groups of unanesthetized rats were exposed (in different orientations) to 36.6, 74.5, and 116.7 kPa BOP exposure inside a pneumatically driven shock tube. Results demonstrated that rats exposed to 116.7 kPa demonstrated transient alterations or loss of consciousness indicated by a transient loss of righting and by increased latencies on the balance beam. The 116.7 kPa exposure was the threshold for overt pathology for acute BOP exposure with approximately 30% of rats presenting with evidence of subdural hemorrhage and cortical contusions. All animals exposed to 116.7 kPa BOP manifested evidence of significant pulmonary hemorrhage. Anterograde memory deficits were observed in rats exposed to 74.5 kPa facing the BOP wave and rats exposed to 116.7 kPa in the lateral (side) orientation. We next assessed repeated exposure to either lateral or frontal 36.6 kPa BOP in anesthetized rats, once per day for 12 days. Results showed that repeated exposure in the frontal, but not side, orientation to the BOPwave produced a transitory learning deficit on a Morris water maze task as shown by significantly longer latencies to reach the submerged platform in the second and third blocks of a four block session. Implications of these data are discussed in relation to the manifestation of mTBI in military personnel exposed to IEDs.

As the reaction proceeds, computational results indicate that polynegative complexes dominate the degradation pathway, followed by cycles of carbon chain opening and breaking. A second possible pathway was identified that leads to polymeric products through Janovsky complex formation. Results from this study indicate that the order of increasing resistance to alkaline hydrolysis is TNT, DNT and DNAN. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84861197035"

Soil redox potential can vary significantly both temporally and spatially in micro-sites. In this study, when soil water content increased, the redox potential decreased, and there was significant enhancement in the biodegradation of a mixture of three explosives. Whereas TNT degradation occurred under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, RDX and HMX degradation occurred only when water content conditions resulted in a prolonged period of negative redox potential. Moreover, under unsaturated conditions, which are more representative of real environmental conditions, the low redox potential, even when measured for temporary periods, was sufficient to facilitate anaerobic degradation. Our results clearly indicate a negative influence of TNT on the biodegradation of RDX and HMX, but this effect was less pronounced than that found in previous slurry batch experiments: this can be explained by a masking effect of the soil in the canisters. Fully or partially saturated soils can promote the existence of micro-niches that differ considerably in their explosives concentration, microbial community and redox conditions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84855694597"

Despite the high incidence of mTBI in deployed personnel, questions remain about the effects of blast-related vs. nonblast- related mTBI on acute and long-term sequelae. This investigation is a retrospective review of service members who presented for evaluation of suspected mTBI and underwent neurocognitive screening evaluation. mTBI diagnosis was made by semistructured clinical interview. Only individuals in whom mechanism of injury could be determined (blast vs. non-blast) were included. Sixty individuals were included in the final sample: 32 with blast mTBI and 28 with non-blast mTBI. There were no differences between the blast-related and non-blast-related mTBI groups on age, time since injury, combat stress symptoms, or headache. Analysis of variance showed no significant between-group differences on any of the neurocognitive performance domains.

Toxicities of NG in the present studies were evaluated for alfalfa (Medicago sativa), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) exposed to NG in Sassafras sandy loam soil. Uptake and degradation of NG were also evaluated in ryegrass. The median effective concentration values for shoot growth ranged from 40 to 231mgkg -1 in studies with NG freshly amended in soil, and from 23 to 185mgkg -1 in studies with NG weathered-and-aged in soil. Weathering-and-aging NG in soil did not significantly affect the toxicity based on 95% confidence intervals for either seedling emergence or plant growth endpoints. Uptake studies revealed that NG was not accumulated in ryegrass but was transformed into dinitroglycerin in the soil and roots, and was subsequently translocated into the ryegrass shoots. The highest bioconcentration factors for dinitroglycerin of 685 and 40 were determined for roots and shoots, respectively.

Reptiles are often good models for contaminants studies due to natural history traits that increase their potential for exposure. We report a study to assess accumulation and effects of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro- 1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) High Melting Explosive) in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). Acute oral toxicity (LD50) was estimated to exceed 2000 mg/kg body weight in adult male and female anoles using a standard up-and-down method. Accumulation of HMX was assessed in adult females via dietary exposure and into eggs by two routes (directly from the soil and via maternal transfer). HMX readily accumulated into adult females in a dose-dependent manner and into eggs following both exposure pathways. However, total HMX in soil-exposed eggs was up to 40-times greater than those exposed via maternal transfer. Although there was a suggestion of an HMX-induced reduction in body weight in adult females, overall there were no effects observed over the 12 week exposure period. The only significant effect on eggs was a 50% reduction in hatching success for eggs exposed to 2000 mg/kg HMX in the soil during incubation. Growth and survival of hatchlings was not affected by HMX exposure. Our results demonstrate that HMX accumulates through the food chain and into eggs from the soil, but likely poses minimal threat to lizards except to hatching success in eggs incubated in soils with HMX levels near maximum nvironmental concentrations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-84861688819"

Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is a major concern in contemporary military medicine and includes a variety of injuries that range from mild to lethal. Extreme forces and their complex propagation characterize BINT. Modern body protection and the development of armored military vehicles can be assumed to have changed the outcome of BINT. Primary blast injuries are caused by overpressure waves whereas secondary, tertiary, and quaternary blast injuries can have more varied origins such as the impact of fragments, abnormal movements, or heat.The characteristics of the blast wave can be assumed to be significantly different in open field detonations compared to explosions in a confined space, such an armored vehicle. Important parameters include peak pressure, duration, and shape of the pulse. Reflections from walls and armor can make the prediction of effects in individual cases very complex. Epidemiological data do not contain information of the comparative importance of the different blast mechanisms. It is therefore important to generate data in carefully designed animal models. Such models can be selective reproductions of a primary blast, penetrating injuries from fragments, acceleration movements, or combinations of such mechanisms. It is of crucial importance that the physical parameters of the employed models are well characterized so that the experiments can be reproduced in different laboratory settings. Ideally, pressure recordings should be calibrated by using the same equipment in several laboratories. With carefully designed models and thoroughly evaluated animal data it should be possible to achieve a translation of data between animal and clinical data. Imaging and computer simulation represent a possible link between experiments and studies of human cases. However, in order for mathematical simulations to be completely useful, the predictions will most likely have to be validated by detailed data from animal experiments. Some aspects of BINT can conceivably be studied in vitro. However, factors such as systemic response, brain edema, inflammation, vasospasm, or changes in synaptic transmission and behavior must be evaluated in experimental animals. Against this background, it is necessary that such animal experiments are carefully developed imitations of actual components in the blast injury.

PS spheres with surface-functionalized carboxyl-group layers could direct a selective imprinting polymerization on their surface through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between surface carboxyl groups and amino monomers. Meanwhile, homogeneous polymerization in the solution phase was completely prevented by stepwise polymerization. The overall process led to the formation of monodisperse molecularly imprinted core-shell microspheres, and was very successful in the preparation of organic polymer and inorganic xerogel shells. Furthermore, greater capacity and faster binding kinetics towards target species were achieved, because surface-imprinted sites ensured the complete removal of templates, good accessibility to target molecules, and low mass-transfer resistance. The results reported herein, concerning the production of high-quality molecularly imprinted products, could also form the basis for the formulation of a new strategy for the fabrication of various functional coating layers on colloidal spheres with potential applications in the fields of separations and chemical sensing. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This selective response is demonstrated by probing the adsorption of two nitro-based molecular explosives (trinitrotoluene and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) and a nonexplosive nitro-based aromatic molecule (nitrotoluene) on mesoporous silicon using soft X-ray spectroscopy. The Si atoms strongly interact with adsorbed molecules to form Si-O and Si-N bonds, as evident from the large shifts in emission energy present in the Si L 2,3 X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements. Furthermore, we find that the energy gap (band gap) of mesoporous silicon changes depending on the adsorbant, as estimated from the Si L 2,3 XES and 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. Our ab initio molecular dynamics calculations of model compounds suggest that these changes are due to spontaneous breaking of the nitro groups upon contacting surface Si atoms. This compound-selective change in electronic structure may provide a powerful tool for the detection and identification of trace quantities of airborne explosive molecules.

Treatment decisions for complex spine injuries after blast trauma require special planning, taking into consideration many different factors and the complicated multiple organ system injuries not normally experienced at most civilian trauma centers. Therefore, an understanding about the effects of blast trauma by spine surgeons in the community has become imperative, as the battlefield has been brought closer to home in many countries through domestic terrorism and mass casualty situations, with the lines blurred between military and civilian trauma.

Additionally, several field studies have reported the presence of RDX or NG along with NO 3 - in groundwater near production plants. Most studies, however, did not specify whether their NO 2 - and NO 3 - analyses were performed on samples which also contained RDX or NG. Inconsistent NO 2 -/NO 3 - results obtained in our laboratory suggested that the presence of RDX or NG in water samples caused an overestimation of NO 2 - and NO 3 - concentrations when using two of the most common analytical methods, namely ionic chromatography and automated colorimetry. This could have important implications for mass balance calculations and for environmental decisions. This paper focused on quantifying the overestimation of NO 2 -/NO 3 - due to the presence of RDX and NG, and finding a method for extracting RDX and NG from water samples without affecting NO 2 -/NO 3 -. Results showed that the overestimation can be predicted using regression coefficients; however the margin of error at the 95% confidence level was between 5 and 15%. Alternatively, a cartridge was found which retains both RDX and NG without affecting NO 2 -/NO 3 -. The cartridge can be used for concentrating the RDX or NG in dilute environmental samples, while removing RDX/NG from solution to allow the interference-free analysis of NO 2 -/NO 3 -. Additionally, if recovery of RDX/NG from the cartridges is not desired, the cartridges could be used for the extraction of more than one sample, thus reducing the costs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84864544377"

However, due to strict explosive regulations and safety requirements, it can be a challenge for agencies with "" bomb dogs"" to train using neat explosive materials. This establishes a need for non-explosive canine training aids with the same volatile component profiles as the explosives that they represent. In order to compare mimic materials to their explosive counterparts, a technique must be established that not only allows for identification of volatile compounds but also can monitor changes in the headspace profile over time with respect to time and temperature. The Automated Training Aid Simulation using SPME (or ATASS) was developed for that purpose. As described, ATASS was used to observe changes in the volatile profile of three explosives (Composition C-4, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and triacetone triperoxide (TATP)) and respective prototype training materials (0.1% by mass C-4, 1% by mass 2,4-DNT, and 1% by mass TATP). Samples were prepared in vials and metal tins within a gallon (≈3785. mL) paint can to simulate common field techniques for canine training. Monitoring these materials in real time provides a better understanding of the major volatile components present and how the relative abundances of these components can change over time.

Microbial inocula were obtained from a PETN-contaminated soil. PETN degradation was evaluated using nitrate and/or sulfate as electron acceptors and acetate as a carbon source. Results showed that under different electron acceptor conditions tested, PETN was sequentially reduced to pentaerythritol via the intermediary formation of tri-, di- and mononitrate pentaerythritol (PETriN, PEDN and PEMN). The addition of nitrate enhanced the degradation rate of PETN by stimulating greater microbial activity and growth of nitrite reducing bacteria that were responsible for degrading PETN. However, a high concentration of nitrite (350mgL-1) accumulated from nitrate reduction, consequently caused self-inhibition and temporarily delayed PETN biodegradation. In contrast, PETN degraded at very similar rates in the presence and absence of sulfate, while PETN inhibited sulfate reduction. It is apparent that denitrifying bacteria possessing nitrite reductase were capable of using PETN and its intermediates as terminal electron acceptors in a preferential utilization sequence of PETN, PETriN, PEDN and PEMN, while sulfate-reducing bacteria were not involved in PETN biodegradation.

In the present study, sheep rumen was studied for its potential to detoxify HMX using analytical chemistry and molecular microbial ecology tools. Results indicated significant loss (p < 0.05) of HMX at 8 h post-incubation and complete disappearance of the parent molecule after 16 h. Qualitative LC-MS/MS analysis provided evidence for the formation of 1-NO-HMX and MEDINA metabolites. A total of 1006 16S rRNA-V3 clones were sequenced and the Classifier tool of the RDPII database was used to sort the sequences at their phylum level. Most sequences were associated with either the phylum Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes. Significant differences at the phylum level (p < 0.001) were found between 0 h and 8 h HMX treatments. Using LibCompare analysis, 8 h HMX treatment showed enrichment of clones (p < 0.01) belonging to the genus Prevotella. From these results, it could be concluded that members of the genus Prevotella are enriched in the rumen and are capable of detoxifying HMX. © 2012 Institut Pasteur.","2-s2.0-84867659072"

By adjusting the monomer concentration, the acid used, and the temperature employed, the average diameter and length of the nanofibers can be readily tuned from 50 to 200 nm and 0.5 to 5 μm, respectively. Structural characterization, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and fluorescence of oligotriphenylene, along with a proposed nanofiber formation mechanism, are presented. Both oligotriphenylene nanofiber dispersions and oligotriphenylene/polysulfone composite films are developed as fluorescent sensors for detecting traces of nitro-based explosives including nitromethane, nitrobenzene, and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, as well as an electron-deficient metal ion, Fe(III). The sensors exhibit much better selectivity and sensitivity compared to conventional sensors, with detection limits down to 1.0 nm with a detection range covering ∼4 orders of magnitude. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent sensors is also disscussed. Blue light-emitting oligotriphenylene nanofiber molecular wires exhibit high thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yield, enhanced conductivity, and stable fluorescence, when compared to the monomer. Fluorescent sensors based on oligotriphenylene nanofibers and their polysulfone composite films enable trace detection, high sensitivity, and high selectivity of nitro-based explosives including nitromethane, nitrobenzene, and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol as well as Fe(III) owing to formation of stable π-electron/charge transfer complexes between the fluorophores and the analytes.

The main goal of this work was to compare the three treatment techniques to evaluate their possible combination for the efficient, low cost treatment of 4NP effluents. In CWs, adsorption on the substrate of 4NP was found to achieve 34-45%. Low concentrations (up to 100 ppm) of 4NP were successfully treated by CWs in 8-12 h. The microbial degradation of 4NP started after a lag phase which was longer with higher initial concentrations of the pollutant. The greatest degradation rate was found to occur at initial concentrations of 4NP between 60 and 90 ppm. Solar TiO2-photocatalysis was faster than the CWs. The greatest removals in terms of mass of 4NP removed after 6 h of irradiation were found to occur at 4NP concentrations of about 200 ppm. Fenton reaction provided complete 4NP degradation up to 500 ppm in only 30 min but TOC was removed by only about 40%. The resulting toxicities were below 20% for initial 4NP concentrations below 300 ppm. It was the Fenton + photoFenton combination (180 min in total) that provided TOC reductions up to 80% and negative L. minor growth inhibition for almost all the 4NP concentrations tested.

Quantitative prediction of tissue residue still represents a challenging task despite long-term interest and pursuit, as tissue residue formation is the result of many dynamic processes including uptake, transformation, and assimilation. The availability of high-dimensional microarray gene expression data presents a new opportunity for computational predictive modeling of tissue residue from changes in expression profile. Here we analyzed a 240-sample data set with measurements of transcriptomic-wide gene expression and tissue residue of two chemicals, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX), in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. We applied two different computational approaches, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and RF (Random Forest), to identify predictor genes and built predictive models. Each approach was tested alone and in combination with a prior variable selection procedure that involved the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and HOPACH (Hierarchical Ordered Partitioning And Collapsing Hybrid). Model evaluation results suggest that LASSO was the best performer of minimum complexity on the TNT data set, whereas the combined Wilcoxon-HOPACH-RF approach achieved the highest prediction accuracy on the RDX data set. Our models separately identified two small sets of ca. 30 predictor genes for RDX and TNT. We have demonstrated that both LASSO and RF are powerful tools for quantitative prediction of tissue residue. They also leave more unknown than explained, however, allowing room for improvement with other computational methods and extension to mixture contamination scenarios. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84855324436"

The studies were carried out by varying pH, dilution ratios of TNT red water, contact time and temperature. The characterizations of BC were analyzed by N2 adsorption, Boehm titration method, mass titration, the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The functional groups of TNT red water was also determined by FTIR. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. It was observed that the Langmuir isotherm fitted the experimental results well and the adsorption involved a physical mechanism by the D-R models analysis. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model described the adsorption kinetics of the organic materials from TNT red water very well. The studies of external diffusion and intraparticle diffusion models showed that external as well as intraparticle diffusion also influenced on the actual adsorption process. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of organic materials from TNT red water on BC was a spontaneous, endothermic process and the randomness increases at the solid/solution interface.

The new design for metal markers which are compounded by an ordered array of metal plates with different magnetic parameters has three fundamental advantages: 1. the markers are sensed directly by the metal detector, and no additional hardware is required; 2. the signatures are sharp; 3. not only the position but also the speed of the detector head can be evaluated. In the case of a stand-alone inertial navigation system for evaluating the position of the detector, the precision would be low due to the sensor noise and its integration. However, knowledge of the relative positions and potentially of the detector head speed over the markers can be used as auxiliary information, and so the eddy-current mapping system will be capable of determining the size of the magnetic imprint of a detected metal object and its position relative to the markers. This increases the reliability of the object discrimination during humanitarian demining, and decreases the numbers of false alarms, which nowadays constitute 99.9% of all alarms emitted by an ordinary mine detector. © 2006 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84859193456"

Traditional groundwater monitoring methods require large volumes of aqueous samples (e.g., 2-4. L) to be shipped under chain of custody, to fixed laboratories for analysis. The samples must also be packed on ice and shielded from light to minimize degradation that may occur during transport and storage. The laboratory's turn-around time for sample analysis and reporting can be as long as 45. d. This process hinders the reporting of data to customers in a timely manner; yields data that are not necessarily representative of current site conditions owing to the lag time between sample collection and reporting; and incurs significant shipping costs for samples. The current work compares a field portable Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) for analysis of MCs on-site with traditional laboratory-based analysis using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with UV absorption detection. The field method provides near real-time (within ∼1. h of sampling) concentrations of MCs in groundwater samples.

Mild traumatic brain injury from IEDs induces various degrees of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances but knowledge of the exact brain pathophysiology following exposure to blast is poorly understood. The study was aimed at establishing a murine model for a mild BI-TBI that isolates low-level blast pressure effects to the brain without systemic injuries. An open-field explosives detonation was used to replicate, as closely as possible, low-level blast trauma in the battlefield or at a terror-attack site. No alterations in basic neurological assessment or brain gross pathology were found acutely in the blast-exposed mice. At 7. days post blast, cognitive and behavioral tests revealed significantly decreased performance at both 4 and 7. m distance from the blast (5.5 and 2.5. PSI, respectively). At 30. days post-blast, clear differences were found in animals at both distances in the object recognition test, and in the 7. m group in the Y maze test.

These changes correlated with sites of up-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase 2 in neurons and CXC-motif chemokine receptor 3 around blood vessels in fiber tracts.

This review focuses on five fundamental questions including: (1) What are the physical correlates for blast TBI in humans? (2) Why is there limited evidence of traditional pulmonary injury from blast in current military field epidemiology? (3) What are the primary blast brain injury mechanisms in humans? (4) If TBI can present with clinical symptoms similar to those of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), how do we clinically differentiate blast TBI from PTSD and other psychiatric conditions? (5) How do we scale experimental animal models to human response? The preponderance of the evidence from a combination of clinical practice and experimental models suggests that blast TBI from direct blast exposure occurs on the modern battlefield. Progress has been made in establishing injury risk functions in terms of blast overpressure time histories, and there is strong experimental evidence in animal models that mild brain injuries occur at blast intensities that are similar to the pulmonary injury threshold. Enhanced thoracic protection from ballistic protective body armor likely plays a role in the occurrence of blast TBI by preventing lung injuries at blast intensities that could cause TBI. Principal areas of uncertainty include the need for a more comprehensive injury assessment for mild blast injuries in humans, an improved understanding of blast TBI pathophysiology of blast TBI in animal models and humans, the relationship between clinical manifestations of PTSD and mild TBI from blunt or blast trauma including possible synergistic effects, and scaling between animals models and human exposure to blasts in wartime and terrorist attacks. Experimental methodologies, including location of the animal model relative to the shock or blast source, should be carefully designed to provide a realistic blast experiment with conditions comparable to blasts on humans. If traditional blast scaling is appropriate between species, many reported rodent blast TBI experiments using air shock tubes have blast overpressure conditions that are similar to human long-duration nuclear blasts, not high explosive blasts. © 2011 Biomedical Engineering Society.","2-s2.0-84855353642"

The results of the Ames test showed that EDDN increased the mean number of revertants per plate with strain TA100, without activation, at 5000 μg/plate compared to the solvent control, which indicated a positive result. No positive results were observed with the other tester strains with or without activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA.

Their fate in soils is ultimately controlled by soil mineralogical and biogeochemical processes. We detonated pure mineral phases with Composition B, a mixture of TNT and RDX, and investigated the fate of detonation residues in aqueous slurries constructed from the detonated minerals. The pure minerals included Ottawa sand (quartz and calcite), microcline feldspar, phlogopite mica, muscovite mica, vermiculite clay, beidellite (a representative of the smectite clay group), and nontronite clay. Energydispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and gas adsorption surface area measurements were made of the pristine and detonated minerals. Batch slurries of detonated minerals and deionized water were sampled for 141 days and TNT, RDX, and TNT transformation products were measured from the aqueous samples and from the mineral substrates at day 141. Detonated samples generally exhibited lower gas adsorption surface areas than pristine ones, likely from residue coating, shockinduced compaction, sintering, and/or partial fusion. TNT and RDX exhibited analyte loss in almost all batch solutions over time but loss was greater in vermiculite, beidellite, and phlogopite than in muscovite and quartz. This suggests common phyllosilicate mineral substrates could be used on military training ranges to minimize off-site migration of explosive residues.

It may be assumed that several mechanisms contribute to the injury. This study is an attempt to characterize the presumed components of the blast induced TBI. Our experimental models include a blast tube in which an anesthetized rat can be exposed to controlled detonations of explosives that result in a pressure wave with a magnitude between 130 and 260 kPa. In this model, the animal is fixed with a metal net to avoid head acceleration forces. The second model is a controlled penetration of a 2 mm thick needle. In the third model the animal is subjected to a high-speed sagittal rotation angular acceleration. Immunohistochemical labeling for amyloid precursor protein revealed signs of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the penetration and rotation models. Signs of punctuate inflammation were observed after focal and rotation injury. Exposure in the blast tube did not induce DAI or detectable cell death, but functional changes. Affymetrix Gene arrays showed changes in the expression in a large number of gene families including cell death, inflammation and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus after both acceleration and penetration injuries. Exposure to the primary blast wave induced limited shifts in gene expression in the hippocampus. The most interesting findings were a downregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. These experiments indicate that rotational acceleration may be a critical factor for DAI and other acute changes after blast TBI.

A series of experiments was conducted to compare the sensitivity of the system response to mechanical properties of the simulants under high strain-rate explosive blasts. Small explosive charges were directed at the models to produce a realistic blast wave in a scaled laboratory setting. Blast profiles were measured and analyzed to compare system response severity. High-speed shadowgraph imaging captured blast wave interaction with the head model while particle tracking captured internal response for displacement and strain correlation. The results suggest amplification of shock waves inside the head near material interfaces due to impedance mismatches. In addition, significant relative displacement was observed between the interacting materials suggesting large strain values of nearly 5%.

Denitrifying bioreactors are an approach where solid carbon substrates are added into the flow path of contaminated water. These carbon (C) substrates (often fragmented wood-products) act as a C and energy source to support denitrification; the conversion of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen gases. Here, we summarize the different designs of denitrifying bioreactors that use a solid C substrate, their hydrological connections, effectiveness, and factors that limit their performance. The main denitrifying bioreactors are: denitrification walls (intercepting shallow groundwater), denitrifying beds (intercepting concentrated discharges) and denitrifying layers (intercepting soil leachate). Both denitrifcation walls and beds have proven successful in appropriate field settings with NO3- removal rates generally ranging from 0.01 to 3.6gNm-3day-1 for walls and 2-22gNm-3day-1 for beds, with the lower rates often associated with nitrate-limitations. Nitrate removal is also limited by the rate of C supply from degrading substrate and removal is operationally zero-order with respect to NO3- concentration primarily because the inputs of NO3- into studied bioreactors have been generally high. In bioreactors where NO3- is not fully depleted, removal rates generally increase with increasing temperature. Nitrate removal has been supported for up to 15 years without further maintenance or C supplementation because wood chips degrade sufficiently slowly under anoxic conditions. There have been few field-based comparisons of alternative C substrates to increase NO3- removal rates but laboratory trials suggest that some alternatives could support greater rates of NO3- removal (e.g., corn cobs and wheat straw). Denitrifying bioreactors may have a number of adverse effects, such as production of nitrous oxide and leaching of dissolved organic matter (usually only for the first few months after construction and start-up). The relatively small amount of field data suggests that these problems can be adequately managed or minimized. An initial cost/benefit analysis demonstrates that denitrifying bioreactors are cost effective and complementary to other agricultural management practices aimed at decreasing nitrogen loads to surface waters. We conclude with recommendations for further research to enhance performance of denitrifying bioreactors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77956871984"

RDX can be released in the environment by way of waste streams generated during the manufacture, use, and disposal of RDX-containing munitions and can leach into groundwater from unexploded munitions found on training ranges. For > 60 years, it has been known that exposure to high doses of RDX causes generalized seizures, but the mechanism has remained unknown. Objective: We investigated the mechanism by which RDX induces seizures. Methods and results: By screening the affinity of RDX for a number of neurotransmitter receptors, we found that RDX binds exclusively to the picrotoxin convulsant site of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) ionophore. Whole-cell in vitro recordings in the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) showed that RDX reduces the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents and the amplitude of GABA-evoked postsynaptic currents. In extracellular field recordings from the BLA, RDX induced prolonged, seizure-like neuronal discharges. Conclusions: These results suggest that binding to the GABAA receptor convulsant site is the primary mechanism of seizure induction by RDX and that reduction of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the amygdala is involved in the generation of RDX-induced seizures. Knowledge of the molecular site and the mechanism of RDX action with respect to seizure induction can guide therapeutic strategies, allow more accurate development of safe thresholds for exposures, and help prevent the development of new explosives or other munitions that could pose similar health risks.","2-s2.0-79952349840"

Because of its relatively weak adsorption to soil, RDX frequently migrates through the unsaturated zone and causes groundwater contamination. In the environment, RDX can transform to produce mono-, di-, and tri-nitroso derivatives (MNX, DNX, and TNX) and the ring cleavage products methylenedinitramine (MEDINA) and 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal (NDAB). The present study was undertaken to analyze RDX and its products in groundwater samples taken from various US military sites. The stability of some of the common transformation intermediates of RDX, including the nitroso derivatives, NDAB and MEDINA, under typical conditions in a groundwater aquifer is not well understood, and appropriate preservation methods for these compounds have not been established. Therefore, we studied the inherent stability of these compounds in deionized water and in groundwater, and evaluated various preservation techniques, including adjustment of pH, temperature, and salinity. NDAB and nitroso derivatives were stable under typical ambient environmental conditions, but MEDINA was highly unstable. The addition of sea salts (10% w/v) was found to stabilize MEDINA when the samples were stored at 4 °C. Using appropriate preservation techniques, we detected nitroso derivatives and NDAB, but no MEDINA, at some of the sites investigated. Stabilizing RDX intermediate products in field samples to allow detection is important because the presence of any of these chemicals can indicate past contamination by RDX and provide insight into the occurrence of in situ natural attenuation. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","2-s2.0-79961164963"

Both percentage of damage (D%) and calculated damage index showed significant DNA damage at almost all concentrations, at all time points assayed. Along exposure time, two different patterns were observed. At the lower TNT concentrations (0.25-0.5 μg/cm2) an increased DNA migration at 48 h, with a decrease close to initial levels after 72 h exposure, was observed. This decrease could be attributed to activation of the DNA repair system. At higher concentrations (1.0-2.0 μg/cm2), the high DNA damage observed remained constant during the 72 h exposure, suggesting that the rate of DNA repair was not enough to compensate such damage. Analysis of NRRT results showed a significant interaction between time and treatment. After 48 h, a significant decrease was observed at 4.0 μg/cm2. After 72 h, NRRT presented a concentration-dependent decrease, significantly different with respect to control at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μg/cm2. The two assayed methods, performed on the same sample, showed clear responses to sublethal TNT exposure in E. fetida, providing sensitive unspecific biomarkers of cell injury and DNA damage. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-79951510340"

The United States and other nations are greatly invested in mitigating these deadly devices. By integrating behavioral aspects of adversarial activities with computational methods, a greater understanding of these activities can be attained; simultaneously, potentially effective intervention points can be ascertained. The specific modeling approach discussed in this article is the result of a coupling between computational and social science research that has led to an improved capability to predict large-scale activities and behaviors of potential IED developers before they have successfully deployed IEDs. System dynamics models were applied to evaluate IED processes as a comprehensive system with various interacting influences. A system dynamics model is an executable model used to represent and understand the dynamic behavior of a complex system over time.","2-s2.0-79960547372"

The application of this method in automatic classification systems is studied, focusing on the part concerned with the formation of feature complexes for assigning an explosive to a predefined class. By using discrete wavelet transforms (DWTs) with the above-mentioned orthogonal wavelets, the feature spaces of classifiers have been formed, which operate with a decision rule following the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method.

In order to develop toxicity data for safety assessment, we investigated the genotoxicity of NTO, using a battery of genotoxicity tests, which included the Ames test, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell chromosome aberration test, L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma mutagenesis test and rat micronucleus test. NTO was not mutagenic in the Ames test or in Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA). NTO did not induce chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells, with or without metabolic activation. In the L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma mutagenesis test, all of the NTO-treated cultures had mutant frequencies that were similar to the average frequencies of solvent control-treated cultures, indicating a negative result. Confirmatory tests for the three in vitro tests also produced negative results. The potential in vivo clastogenicity and aneugenicity of NTO was evaluated using the rat peripheral blood micronucleus test. NTO was administered by oral gavage to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days at doses up to 2g/kg/day. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood demonstrated no significant induction of micronucleated reticulocytes relative to the vehicle control (PEG-200). These studies reveal that NTO was not genotoxic in either in vitro or in vivo tests and suggest a low risk of genetic hazards associated with exposure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-78650578704"

This kind of stimulation involves subjecting pups aged between 3 and 16 days to mild forms of stimulation leading to ""stress,"" and is said to lead to faster maturation and better problem-solving abilities later in life. ENS resulted from a U.S. Military program called Bio Sensor, and is currently being used in some other working dog programs. It has been part of the breeding program for mine detection dogs at the Global Training Centre (GTC, part of Norwegian People's Aid) for 4 years.To investigate the effects of ENS on the basis of a previous study (Battaglia, 2009, J. Vet. Behav.: Clin. Appl. Res. 4, 203-210), 10 litters born since the spring of 2008 at the GTC were randomly divided into the following 2 groups: (1) those receiving ENS, and (2) those receiving the same amount of human attention without being subjected to the ENS exercises. Developmental parameters were monitored by the kennel staff. The pups were subjected to testing at approximately 10 weeks of age by investigators who were blinded to treatment. Their careers as working dogs were monitored.There was no observed effect of ENS on either the development of the pups when compared with those who were exposed to the standard GTC stimulation program within the same age range or on the later training results of the dogs in their careers as mine detection dogs. This lack of effect could well be the result of the very rich standards of the GTC socialization program that is given to these dogs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-79951869390"

Scintillation light is captured by orthogonal arrays of wavelength-shifting fibers placed on either side of the scintillator surface and then transferred to X and Y multi-pixel PMTs. A timing circuit, used with pulsed neutron sources, records the time when a neutron detection takes place relative to an external synchronization pulse from the pulsed source.

The magnetic carbon was made by mixing aqueous suspensions of activated carbon with an aqueous Fe 3+/Fe 2+ solution followed by treatment with NaOH. The morphologies and surface chemistries of both magnetic and non-magnetic activated carbons were studied by FT-IR, X-ray, SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, EDXRF, pH pzc, elemental analysis, surface area (S BET), density and magnetic moment determinations. The SBET areas of non-magnetic and magnetic activated carbons were 733 and 527m 2g -1, respectively. Batch sorption studies were performed at different temperatures, pH values and solid-to-liquid ratios. Sorption isotherms were obtained over a concentration range from ∼23 to 228mg/L (1.0×10 -4 to 1.0×10 -3M). As temperature increased, TNP adsorption modestly decreased on non-magnetic activated carbon (ASAC) but slightly increased on magnetic activated carbon (MASAC). Sorption performances at different temperatures were evaluated using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Sips adsorption models. First and second order kinetic models were tested, confirming second order behavior. Both ASAC and MASAC readily removed TNP in single and binary systems. MASAC and ASAC gave similar overall adsorption results with TNP, although the lower carbon content per gram of adsorbent and lower surface area of MASAC reduced its overall adsorption capacity per unit weight. MASAC is easily manipulated by low external magnetic fields, permitting its use for easy separation from aqueous-phase environmental applications. Almost complete (∼97%) desorption of TNP was readily achieved by methanol and hot water.

Primary blast injury to the lungs (blast lung) is found in a clinically significant proportion of casualties from explosions even in an open environment, and in a high proportion of severely injured casualties following explosions in confined spaces. Blast casualties also commonly suffer secondary and tertiary blast injuries resulting in significant blood loss. The presence of hypoxaemia owing to blast lung complicates the process of fluid resuscitation. Consequently, prolonged hypotensive resuscitation was found to be incompatible with survival after combined blast lung and haemorrhage. This article describes studies addressing new forward resuscitation strategies involving a hybrid blood pressure profile (initially hypotensive followed later by normotensive resuscitation) and the use of supplemental oxygen to increase survival and reduce physiological deterioration during prolonged resuscitation. Surprisingly, hypertonic saline dextran was found to be inferior to normal saline after combined blast injury and haemorrhage. New strategies have therefore been developed to address the needs of blast-injured casualties and are likely to be particularly useful under circumstances of enforced delayed evacuation to surgical care. © 2011 The Royal Society.","2-s2.0-79251505560"

Although there are numerous forms of in situ and ex situ bioremediation, ruminants would provide the option of an in situ bioreactor that could be transported to the site of contamination. Bovine rumen fluid has been previously shown to transform 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a similar compound, in 4 h. In this study, RDX incubated in whole ovine rumen fluid was nearly eliminated within 4 h. Whole ovine rumen fluid was then inoculated into five different types of media to select for archaeal and bacterial organisms capable of RDX biotransformation. Cultures containing 30 μg mL -1 RDX were transferred each time the RDX concentration decreased to 5 μg mL -1 or less. Time point samples were analyzed for RDX biotransformation by HPLC. The two fastest transforming enrichments were in methanogenic and low nitrogen basal media. After 21 days, DNA was extracted from all enrichments able to partially or completely transform RDX in 7 days or less. To understand microbial diversity, 16S rRNA-gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting was conducted. Cloning and sequencing of partial 16S rRNA fragments were performed on both low nitrogen basal and methanogenic media enrichments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similar homologies to eight different bacterial and one archaeal genera classified under the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Euryarchaeota. After continuing enrichment for RDX degraders for 1 year, two consortia remained: one that transformed RDX in 4 days and one which had slowed after 2 months of transfers without RDX. DGGE comparison of the slower transforming consortium to the faster one showed identical banding patterns except one band. Homology matches to clones from the two consortia identified the same uncultured Clostridia genus in both; Sporanaerobacter acetigenes was identified only in the consortia able to completely transform RDX.

Sediments exhibiting the highest rate of TNT disappearance under biotic conditions also exhibited the highest sorption affinity for TNT under abiotic conditions. Significant temperature dependence in the abiotic processes was observed in the diffusion coefficient of TNT and not sediment sorption affinity.

Anoxic batch systems were started with and without pre-aeration of aquifer material to distinguish initial biological RDX reduction from abiotic RDX reduction. Aerating the sediment eliminated chemical reductants in the native aquifer sediment, primarily Fe(II) sorbed to mineral surfaces. RDX (50 μM) was completely reduced and transformed to ring cleavage products when excess concentrations (2. mM) of acetate or lactate were provided as the electron donor for aerated sediment. RDX was reduced concurrently with Fe(III) when acetate was provided, while RDX, Fe(III), and sulfate were reduced simultaneously with lactate amendment. Betaproteobacteria were the dominant microorganisms associated with RDX and Fe(III)/sulfate reduction. In particular, Rhodoferax spp. increased from 21% to 35% and from 28% to 60% after biostimulation by acetate and lactate, respectively. Rarefaction analyses demonstrated that microbial diversity decreased in electron-donor-amended systems with active RDX degradation.

Anemia in a TNT worker is considered a sentinel health event (occupational) (SHE(O)) in the United States (US). Deaths have been reported secondary to aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that TNT systemic absorption is significant by both the respiratory and dermal routes. No studies encountered looked at hemoglobin change or anemia cases in respiratory protected workers. It is hypothesized that respiratory protection is insufficient to protect TNT workers from the risk of anemia development and hemoglobin concentration drop. Methods A records review of eight groups of respiratory protected TNT workers' pre-exposure hemoglobin levels were compared with their during-exposure hemoglobin levels for statistically significant (alpha level 0.05) hemoglobin level changes, and anemia cases were recorded. A curve estimation analysis was performed between mean TNT air concentrations and mean hemoglobin change values. Results Statistically significant hemoglobin level drops and anemia cases were apparent at TNT air concentrations about the REL and PEL in respiratory protected workers. There were no anemia cases or statistically significant hemoglobin level drops at concentrations about the TLV, however. A statistically significant inverse non-linear regression model was found to be the best fit for regressing hemoglobin change on TNT air concentration. Conclusions Respiratory protection may be inadequate to prevent workers who are at risk for TNT skin absorption from developing anemia. This study contributes evidence that the TLV should be considered for adoption as the new PEL.","2-s2.0-79955964099"

Micro DTA facilitates recording of a calorimetric profile for nanograms of materials. The profile comprises a combination of sublimation, melting, evaporation and deflagration for the sample material.

We linked chromic responsive polydiacetylene (PDA) onto a peptide-based molecular recognition element for trinitrotoluene (TNT) molecules in order to provide a system capable of responding to the presence of a TNT target. We first identified the trimer peptide receptor that could induce chromic changes on a PDA backbone. We then investigated the multivalent interactions between TNT and our peptide-based receptor by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We further characterized various parameters that affected the conjugated PDA system and hence the chromic response, including the size of end-group motifs, the surface density of receptors, and the length of alkane side chains. Taking these necessary design parameters into account, we demonstrated a modular system capable of transducing small-molecule TNT binding into a detectable signal.

XplA along with its partnering reductase XplB are plasmid encoded and the gene xplA has now been found in divergent genera across the globe with near sequence identity.

Velocity variations and comparison with the numerical model HYDRUS-2D indicate the presence of preferential flow paths. Water content and movement near TNT and DNT buried source highly influence their transport in soils and near soil-atmospheric surfaces. The formation of preferential flow paths are attributed to disturbances of soil properties by burial of ERC sources and water content heterogeneities. By the analysis of velocity variations, disturbances near the buried source resulted in hydraulic heterogeneities and preferential flow near the source, which influence their transport away from the source. Preferential flow causes faster movement and greater dispersion of the solutes during infiltration periods, and influences the rate of mixing in the system.","2-s2.0-78650333803"

Methods and Results: The pilot test experienced wide fluctuations influent concentrations and there was lower than 0.50mgl-1 of 2,4-DNT in the effluent of the system. The removal efficiency was above 99%. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 2,4-DNT was mainly reduced to 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene (2-A-4-NT), 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (4-A-2-NT), and 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-DAT) during the anaerobic reaction. In addition, ethanol was added into the influent as the electron donor. Because of the use of part ethanol as an auxiliary carbon source, more than twice the theoretical requirement of ethanol was needed to achieve a high 2,4-DNT removal efficiency (>93%). ESEM observations showed that the carrier could immobilize micro-organisms, which flourished more in reactors operating over longer periods. Further research by PCR-DGGE revealed that new 2,4-DNT-resistant bacterial had been generated during the stress of 2,4-DNT for 150days. The dominant species for 2,4-DNT degradation were identified by a comparison with gene sequences in GenBank. Conclusions: 2,4-DNT could be effectively degraded by the combined process and ethanol played an important role in the biotransformation. The proposed transformation pathway of 2,4-DNT was concluded. During the 150-day operation, some microbial taxa unaccustomed to 2,4-DNT died out and some new 2,4-DNT-resistant microbial taxa appeared. Significance and Impact of the Study: The study provides a novel method for the bioremediation of 2,4-DNT, which is difficult to degrade by traditional biological methods. The most 2,4-DNT-resistant microbial taxa have not been reported elsewhere and they may be helpful to the treatment of actual 2,4-DNT wastewater. © 2011 The Authors.

Ammonium perchlorate is one of the main constituents in Army's new main charge melt-pour energetic, PAX-21. In addition to ammonium perchlorate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) are the major constituents of PAX-21. In order to evaluate microbial perchlorate reduction as a practical option for the treatment of perchlorate in PAX-21 wastewater, we conducted biodegradation experiments using glucose as the primary sources of electrons and carbon. Batch experiments showed that negligible perchlorate was removed in microbial reactors containing PAX-21 wastewater while control bottles containing seed bacteria and glucose rapidly and completely removed perchlorate. These results suggested that the constituents in PAX-21 wastewater may be toxic to perchlorate reducing bacteria. A series of batch toxicity test was conducted to identify the toxic constituents in PAX-21 and DNAN was identified as the primary toxicant responsible for inhibiting the activity of perchlorate reducing bacteria. It was hypothesized that pretreatment of PAX-21 by zero-valent iron granules will transform toxic constituents in PAX-21 wastewater to non-toxic products. We observed complete reduction of DNAN to 2,4-diaminoanisole (DAAN) and RDX to formaldehyde in abiotic iron reduction study. After a 3-day acclimation period, perchlorate in iron-treated PAX-21 wastewater was rapidly decreased to an undetectable level in 2 days. This result demonstrated that iron treatment not only removed energetic compounds but also eliminated the toxic constituents that inhibited the subsequent microbial process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-79960173029"

Because traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast exposure has become a prominent medical and military problem, similar thresholds should be identified that can put available research results in context and guide future research toward protecting war fighters as well as diagnosis and treatment. At least three mechanical mechanisms by which the blast wave may result in brain injury have been proposed-a thoracic mechanism, head acceleration, and direct cranial transmission. These mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. In this study, likely regions of interest for the first two mechanisms based on blast characteristics (positive pulse duration and peak effective overpressure) are developed using available data from blast experiments and related studies, including behind-armor blunt trauma and ballistic pressure wave studies. These related studies are appropriate to include because blast-like pressure waves are produced that result in neurological effects like those caused by blast. Results suggest that injury thresholds for each mechanism are dependent on blast conditions, and that under some conditions, more than one mechanism may contribute. There is a subset of blast conditions likely to result in TBI due to head acceleration and/or a thoracic mechanism without concomitant lung injury. These results can be used to guide experimental designs and compare additional data as they become available.

We asked whether beliefs of scent detection dog handlers affect team performance and evaluated relative importance of human versus dog influences on handlers' beliefs. Eighteen drug and/or explosive detection dog/handler teams each completed two sets of four brief search scenarios (conditions). Handlers were falsely told that two conditions contained a paper marking scent location (human influence). Two conditions contained decoy scents (food/toy) to encourage dog interest in a false location (dog influence). Conditions were (1) control; (2) paper marker; (3) decoy scent; and (4) paper marker at decoy scent. No conditions contained drug or explosive scent; any alerting response was incorrect. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used with search condition as the independent variable and number of alerts as the dependent variable. Additional nonparametric tests compared human and dog influence. There were 225 incorrect responses, with no differences in mean responses across conditions. Response patterns differed by condition. There were more correct (no alert responses) searches in conditions without markers. Within marked conditions, handlers reported that dogs alerted more at marked locations than other locations. Handlers' beliefs that scent was present potentiated handler identification of detection dog alerts. Human more than dog influences affected alert locations. This confirms that handler beliefs affect outcomes of scent detection dog deployments. © 2011 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-79955066495"

In order to examine these relationships, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were aqueously exposed to solvent control (ethanol) or two nominal concentrations of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a mitochondrial electron transport chain uncoupler, for a 24-h period. Following exposure, fish were placed in a swim tunnel in clean water for swimming testing or euthanized immediately without testing, followed by analysis of whole body triglyceride levels. U crit decreased in both the 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L DNP groups, with 12 mg/L approaching the LC50. A decrease in tail beat frequency was observed without a significant change in tail beat amplitude. In contrast, triglyceride levels were elevated in a concentration-dependent manner in the DNP exposure groups, but only in fish subjected to swimming tests. This increase in triglyceride stores may be due to a direct interference of DNP on lipid catabolism as well as increased triglyceride production when zebrafish were subjected to the co-stressors of swimming and toxicant exposure.

Israel's coastal aquifer was contaminated with RDX. This aquifer is mostly aerobic and we therefore sought aerobic bacteria that might be involved in natural attenuation of the compound in the aquifer. RDX-degrading bacteria were captured by passively sampling the indigenous bacteria onto sterile sediments placed within sampling boreholes. Aerobic RDX biodegradation potential was detected in the sediments sampled from different locations along the plume. RDX degradation with the native sampled consortium was accompanied by 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal formation. Two bacterial strains of the genus Rhodococcus were isolated from the sediments and identified as aerobic RDX degraders. The xplA gene encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme was partially (~500 bp) sequenced from both isolates. The obtained DNA sequences had 99% identity with corresponding gene fragments of previously isolated RDX-degrading Rhodococcus strains. RDX degradation by both strains was prevented by 200 μM of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor metyrapone, suggesting that cytochrome P450 indeed mediates the initial step in RDX degradation. RDX biodegradation activity by the T7 isolate was inhibited in the presence of nitrate or ammonium concentrations above 1.6 and 5.5 mM, respectively (100 mg l-1) while the T9N isolate's activity was retarded only by ammonium concentrations above 5.5 mM. This study shows that bacteria from the genus Rhodococcus, potentially degrade RDX in the saturated zone as well, following the same aerobic degradation pathway defined for other Rhodococcus species. RDX-degrading activity by the Rhodococcus species isolate T9N may have important implications for the bioremediation of nitrate-rich RDX-contaminated aquifers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-79961171989"

The batch-wise experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the sonolytic behavior, including power intensity, TiO2 dosage, acidity of wastewater, reaction temperature and oxygen dosage. It is worthy to note that the nitrotoluene contaminants could be almost completely eliminated by sonochemical oxidation enhanced significantly with the addition of TiO 2 due to the supply of adsorbent and/or excess nuclei. High destruction rate of nitrotoluenes could be achieved by increasing the acidity of wastewater and decreasing the reaction temperature.

Further, based on the spectra obtained from GC-MS, it is proposed that DNTs dissolved in wastewater proceed with similar reaction pathways as those adsorbed on TiO2.

An aqueous batch containing powdered Composition B in water was sampled over time to quantify TNT, RDX, and HMX dissolution from undetonated Composition B particles. The TNT, RDX, and HMX concentrations in aqueous batches of pure Composition B reached equilibrium within 6, 11, and 20 d, respectively. Detonated soils exhibited lower gas-exchangeable surface areas than their pristine counterparts. This is likely due to an explosive residue coating on detonated soil surfaces, shock-induced compaction, sintering, and/or partial fusion of soil particles under the intense heat associated with detonation.

Consequently, bomb technicians are known to experience symptoms of heat illness while performing their work. This research provides the first field based analysis of heat strain in bomb technicians. Six participants undertook simulated operational tasks across 2 days of variable climate. All subjects demonstrated high levels of heat strain as evidenced by elevated heart rate, core body temperature, and physiological strain index. Participants also reported signs and symptoms associated with heat illness. These results were exacerbated by more intense physical activity despite being undertaken in a cooler environment.

In the one-year bioassay, impacts were assessed by statistical comparisons of females from breeding groups reared in control or RDX-exposure conditions. The RDX had no significant effect on gonadosomatic index or condition factor assayed at 1 d and at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. The liver-somatic index was significantly increased versus controls only at the 12-month timepoint. RDX had no significant effect on live-prey capture rates, egg production, or fertilization. RDX caused minimal differential-transcript expression with no consistent discernable effect on gene-functional categories for either brain or liver tissues in the one-year exposure. In the multigenerational assay, the effects of acute (96h) exposure to RDX were compared in fish reared to the F2 generation in either control or RDX-exposure conditions. Enrichment of gene functions including neuroexcitatory glutamate metabolism, sensory signaling, and neurological development were observed comparing control-reared and RDX-reared fish. Our results indicated that exposure to RDX at a concentration representing the highest levels observed in the environment (0.83mg/L) had limited impacts on genomic, individual, and population-level endpoints in fathead minnows in a one-year exposure.

By combining a high volume sampling nozzle with an inline 2-stage preconcentrator and a Fido, greater standoff is achieved than with the Fido alone. The direct application of this system is on the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS) but could be deployed on a large variety of robotic platforms. It is being developed under the auspices of the U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Countermine Division. This device is one of several detection tools and technologies to be used on the AMDS. These systems will have multiple, and at times, overlapping objectives. One objective is trace detection on the surface of an unknown potential target. By increasing the standoff capabilities of the detector, the fine manipulation of the robot deploying the detector is less critical. Current detectors used on robotic systems must either be directly in the vapor plume or make direct contact with the target. By increasing the standoff, detection is more easily and quickly achieved. The end result detector must overcome cross-contamination, sample throughput, and environmental issues.

This study aimed at understanding the trends, demography and other epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized landmine injured patients in Erbil governorate. Methods. The case records of landmine injured patients who had been admitted to the Emergency Management Centre in Erbil city from July 1998 to July 2007 were reviewed and descriptively analyzed. Results: Two hundred eighty five landmine injured patients were admitted to the center, their mean SD age was 26.5 13.2 years (range 6-71 years), 95.1% were males, nearly 50% were between 19 to 35 years of age and 96.8% were civilians. Around 72% of victims sustained limb amputations; 58.6% lower limb and 13.3% upper limb out of the total. The hospital mortality rate was 2.1%. The number of admissions for landmine injury was steadily decreasing between July 1998 and July 2001, followed by prominent increase between July 2002 and July 2003. The highest proportion of admissions occurred in summer (35.4%) and majority of incidents occurred along the borders with Iran and Turkey (61.8%). Conclusion: Civilian male adolescents and young adults constituted the majority of hospitalized landmine victims in Erbil governorate. While a high proportion of victims sustained lower limb amputations, upper limb amputations particularly among children and injury to head and face were relatively common which might be attributed to handling explosives. This emphasizes the need to examine the reasons behind handling explosives. © 2010Shabila et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","2-s2.0-79957911987"

Sufficiently high perchlorate intakes can modify thyroid function by competitively inhibiting iodide uptake in adults; however, little is known about perchlorate exposure and health effects in infants. Food intake models predict that infants have higher perchlorate exposure doses than adults. For this reason, we measured perchlorate and related anions (nitrate, thiocyanate, and iodide) in 206 urine samples from 92 infants ages 1-377 days and calculated perchlorate intake dose for this sample of infants. The median estimated exposure dose for this sample of infants was 0.160 μg/kg/day. Of the 205 individual dose estimates, 9% exceeded the reference dose of 0.7 μg/kg/day; 6% of infants providing multiple samples had multiple perchlorate dose estimates above the reference dose. Estimated exposure dose differed by feeding method: breast-fed infants had a higher perchlorate exposure dose (geometric mean 0.220 μg/kg/day) than infants consuming cow milk-based formula (geometric mean 0.103 μg/kg/day, p < 0.0001) or soy-based formula (geometric mean 0.027 μg/kg/day, p < 0.0001), consistent with dose estimates based on dietary intake data. The ability of perchlorate to block adequate iodide uptake by the thyroid may have been reduced by the iodine-sufficient status of the infants studied (median urinary iodide 125 μg/L).

Bioremediation that involves the capabilities of microorganisms in the removal of pollutants is the most promising, relatively efficient and cost-effective technology. However, the current bioremediation approaches suffer from a number of limitations which include the poor capabilities of microbial communities in the field, lesser bioavailability of contaminants on spatial and temporal scales, and absence of bench-mark values for efficacy testing of bioremediation for their widespread application in the field.

The batch-wise experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the sonophotocatalytic behavior, including ultrasonic power intensity, TiO 2 dosage, reaction temperature and oxygen dosage. It is remarkable that the nitrotoluene contaminants could be almost completely eliminated by virtue of sonophotocatalysis, wherein TiO 2 serves as both photocatalysts and nuclei, leading to enhancement of cavitation bubble numbers. Based on the result given by pyrolysis/gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Pyrolysis/GC-MS), it is postulated that DNTs adsorbed on TiO 2 preliminarily undergo denitration pathway into o-mononitrotoluene (MNT) or oxidation pathway into 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), respectively. Further, according to the spectra obtained from GC-MS, it is proposed that DNTs existed in wastewater proceed with similar reaction pathways as those adsorbed on TiO 2.

We developed a fathead minnow brain-tissue cDNA library enriched for transcripts differentially expressed in response to RDX and trinitrotoluene (TNT) exposure. All 4,128 cDNAs were sequenced, quality filtered and assembled yielding 2230 unique sequences and 945 significant blastx matches (E≤10-5). The cDNA library was leveraged to create custom-spotted microarrays for use in transcript expression assays. The impact of RDX on transcript expression in brain tissue was examined in fathead minnows exposed to RDX at 0.625, 2.5, 5, 10mg/L or an acetone-spike control for 10 days. Overt toxicity of RDX in fathead minnow occurred only at the highest exposure concentration resulting in 50% mortality and weight loss. Conversely, Bayesian analysis of microarray data indicated significant changes in transcript expression at concentrations as low as 0.625mg/L. In total, 154 cDNAs representing 44 unique transcripts were differentially expressed in RDX exposures, the majority of which were validated by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Investigation of molecular pathways, gene ontology (GO) and individual gene functions affected by RDX exposures indicated changes in metabolic processes involved in: oxygen transport, neurological function, calcium binding/signaling, energy metabolism, cell growth/division, oxidative stress and ubiquitination. In total, our study indicated that RDX exposure affected molecular processes critical to CNS function in fathead minnow. © 2010.","2-s2.0-78649909257"

The results obtained in terms of performance of the relative (EBS) neutrons confirmed that the proposed source shield has significantly improved the signal to background ratio.

Blast exposure has been the most common cause of TBI, occurring through multiple mechanisms. What is less clear is whether the primary blast wave causes brain damage through mechanisms that are distinct from those common in civilian TBI and whether multiple exposures to low-level blast can lead to long-term sequelae. Complicating TBI in soldiers is the high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder. At present, the relationship is unclear.

This prediction tool, termed the HIP (human injury predictor) code, was intended to: - assist the security services to encourage favourable crowd distributions and densities within scenarios of 'sensitivity'; - provide guidance to security engineers concerning the most effective location for protection systems; - inform rescue services as to where, in the case of such an event, individuals with particular injuries will be located; - assist in training medical personnel concerning the scope and types of injuries that would be sustained as a consequence of a particular attack; - assist response planners in determining the types ofmedical specialists (burns, traumatic amputations, lungs, etc.) required and thus identify the appropriate hospitals to receive the various casualty types. This document describes the algorithms used in the development of this tool, together with the pertinent underpinning physical processes. From its rudimentary beginnings as a simple spreadsheet, theHIP code now has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows three-dimensional visualization of results and intuitive scenario set-up. The code is underpinned by algorithms that predict the pressure and momentum outputs produced by PBIEDs within open and confined environments, aswell as the trajectories of shrapnel deliberately placed within the device to increase injurious effects. Further logic has been implemented to transpose these weapon effects into forms of human injury depending on where individuals are located relative to the PBIED. Each crowd member is subdivided into representative body parts, each of which is assigned an abbreviated injury score after a particular calculation cycle. The injury levels of each affected body part are then summated and a triage state assigned for each individual crowd member based on the criteria specified within the 'injury scoring system'. To attain a comprehensive picture of a particular event, it is important that a number of simulations, using what is substantively the same scenario, are undertaken with natural variation being applied to the crowd distributions and the PBIED output. Accurate mathematical representation of such complex phenomena is challenging, particularly as the code must be quick-running to be of use to the stakeholder community. In addition to discussing the background and motivation for the algorithm and GUI development, this document also discusses the steps taken to validate the tool and the plans for further functionality implementation. © 2011 The Royal Society.","2-s2.0-79251490388"

Nitrobenzene is of environmental concern because of its toxicity. In the presence of zero-valent iron (ZVI), reduction of the nitro group is the dominant transformation process for nitrobenzene. A series of experiments were carried out to investigate the kinetics of nitrobenzene reduction by ZVI and the effects of pH and ZVI particle size on nitrobenzene removal in groundwater. The results indicated that nitrobenzene could be reduced to aniline by ZVI; the reduction of nitrobenzene by ZVI followed a pseudo first-order kinetics; the observed nitrobenzene reduction rate constant (kobs) was 0.0006 min-1 and the half-life of nitrobenzene (t1/2) was 115.5 min; the mass balance achieved 87.5% for nitrobenzene reduction by the 1 mm ZVI particle and the final removal efficiency was 80.98%. In addition, the pH and ZVI particle size were found to exhibit significant influences on the nitrobenzene reduction. The observed nitrobenzene reduction rate constant linearly decreased with increase pH and the data fitted on polynomial regression equation for the observed nitrobenzene reduction rate constant and ZVI particle size. Therefore, use of ZVI based permeable reactive barrier technology to remedy nitrobenzene contaminated groundwater was feasible. © 2010 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","2-s2.0-78349260798"

Electron shuttling compounds including anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) and soluble humic substances stimulated RDX mineralization in aquifer sediment. RDX mass-loss was similar in electron shuttle amended and donor-alone treatments; however, the concentrations of nitroso metabolites, in particular TNX, and ring cleavage products (e. g., HCHO, MEDINA, NDAB, and NH4+) were different in shuttle-amended incubations. Nitroso metabolites accumulated in the absence of electron shuttles (i. e., acetate alone). Most notably, 40-50% of [14C]-RDX was mineralized to 14CO2 in shuttle-amended incubations. Mineralization in acetate amended or unamended incubations was less than 12% within the same time frame. The primary differences in the presence of electron shuttles were the increased production of NDAB and formaldehyde. NDAB did not further degrade, but formaldehyde was not present at final time points, suggesting that it was the mineralization precursor for Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms. RDX was reduced concurrently with Fe(III) reduction rather than nitrate or sulfate reduction. Amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) indicated that unique Fe(III)-reducing microbial communities (β- and γ-proteobacteria) predominated in shuttle-amended incubations. These results demonstrate that indigenous Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms in RDX-contaminated environments utilize extracellular electron shuttles to enhance RDX mineralization. Electron shuttle-mediated RDX mineralization may become an effective in situ option for contaminated environments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-78650174435"

This method is used for the identification of antitank and antipersonnel mines and classification of buried objects within a target region. In this paper, a mobile SN is used to detect mines and some other objects buried and creating magnetic anomaly in and around the region where they are found, with the behavior of the individual sensors swarming onto the area under which a mine or any other object is buried. The process of collecting data by the SN and modeling it mathematically are explained in detail. The SN is modeled as a fictitious two-dimensional spatial impulse sampler. This paper is motivated by clearing the territories of mine fields to open them to agriculture. It is very important because, currently, in some countries, very fertile territories around the borders are covered by buried mines. The approach is basically based on magnetic anomaly measurements, which directly tackles the subregions corresponding to buried objects whether they represent objects that are separately located or occluded by other objects. It is based on a new developed method that is called ""the back-most object detection and identification algorithm."" This method is fully automatic, and there is no human intervention throughout the process. In this paper, classification of objects is based on their well-known shapes and dimensions. Therefore, there is no need for sophisticated learning algorithms to achieve classification. The experimental results are given both for detection and identification of a single mine and classification of a number of mines and any other objects that have a potential of giving false alarms in a target region. © 2006 IEEE.","2-s2.0-79951675092"

This study establishes IED trends in the Afghanistan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, and Nimroz and the Pakistani province of Balochistan between 2002 and mid-2009, using geo-referenced open source IED event information and statistical or geospatial analysis techniques. This study also furnishes assessments of specific IED technologies, techniques, and procedures (TTPs; like explosively formed projectiles or radio-controlled ""spider devices"") as well as discussions of their potential causes and observable effects. There are several major trends observed: a continuous increase in volume and lethality of attacks, more expansive geographic distribution of attacks, and multiple bombing campaigns overlapping in Quetta, Balochistan province, that are perpetrated by groups with different means, tactics, and objectives. The most IED-related violence occurred in Kandahar province from 2002-2008; however, Helmand province was the leading location of bomb events by early 2009. Although large population centers-such as the cities of Kandahar, Quetta, and Lashkar Gah in Helmand province-commonly experienced effective bombings, the trans-border routes through Zaranj in Nimroz province and Spin Boldak in Kandahar province were also prone to many lethal attacks. In particular, this study both confirms and scrutinizes the so-called Iraq effect, the phenomenon of knowledge-sharing between fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even though fighters who gained experience in the Iraq insurgency provided assistance and training to Taliban fighters, the evidence indicates that some developments in IEDs predated the Iraq conflict or were original to South Asia or other conflicts in history. This evidence provides support for a more generalized and global phenomenon here called ""TTP acceleration,"" whereby insurgent and terrorist advances in IED capabilities take progressively shorter periods of time to develop and transfer among groups, usually as a result of increased information-sharing opportunities and coincidental alignment of group objectives. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-79960960598"

The traditional view of ""trace"" level residue may lie within the detection limit capabilities of bench-top instrumentation. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry, often the main stay of many trace evidence analysis laboratories can readily deliver nanogram and now potentially upper picogram detection limits. Today, emerging technologies continue to push the limits of detection, and sub-nanogram restrictions give way to picogram and femtogram opportunities. As instrument technologies become more sensitive, the need to work at continually lower detection levels is expressed. Generation of reliable, reproducible ultra-trace samples for the testing, analysis and evaluation of those technologies is challenged by the chemical properties of the very samples under investigation. Unlike testing against bulk quantities of explosives, at the picogram level unforeseen sublimation and sorption phenomena may potentially disrupt an otherwise well-planned test. While it may be valid to assume that the properties of bulk samples of most explosives are relatively constant with respect to time, it may not be safe to assume the same is true of ultra-trace level deposits of explosive residue. The vapor pressures of many common military explosives are low, but they are not zero. This fact cannot be ignored when working with trace levels of explosive residue. Failure of an inexperienced technician to consider these factors when conducting an evaluation may unnecessarily introduce bias into the data, and may result in the misrepresentation of a sensor's capabilities. The analyst is now faced with the complication of working with amounts of explosive so potentially low, that loss of a few picograms of material due to evaporation, air currents, poor laboratory technique or some other diluting factor represents a significant percentage of the total sample mass. Added to the complication are sample and substrate matrix, carry-over, and potential cross contamination effects that may now pose a significant effect rather than a slight background nuisance. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","2-s2.0-77955856971"

In both species, the olfactory mucosa comprised olfactory, supporting and basal cells, and a lamina propria containing bundles of olfactory cell axons, Bowman's glands and vascular elements.

Other potential long-duration threats include large explosions from improvised explosive devices, weapons caches, and other explosives including nuclear explosives. However, there are very few long-duration pulmonary blast injury assessments, and use of short-duration exposure injury metrics is inappropriate as the injury mechanism for long-duration exposures is likely different from that of short-duration exposures. Methods:: This study develops an injury model for long-duration (>10 milliseconds positive overpressure phase) blasts with sharp rising overpressures. For this study, data on more than 2,730 large animal experiments were collected from more than 55 experimental studies on blast. From this dataset, nearly 850 large animal experiments were selected with positive phase overpressure durations of 10 milliseconds or more. Various models were evaluated to determine the best fit of injury risk as a function of pressure and duration. A linear logistic regression was performed on the experimental data for threshold injury and lethality in terms of pressure and duration. The effects of mass, pressure, and duration scaling were all evaluated, and two goodness-of-fit indicators were used to assess the different models. Results and Conclusions:: New injury risk assessment curves were determined for both incident and reflected pressure conditions for reflecting surface and free-field exposures. Position dependent injury risk curves were also determined. The resulting curves are an improvement to existing assessments, because they use actual data to demonstrate theoretical assumptions on the injury risk. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","2-s2.0-77955867590"

Two hypergolic compounds, dimethylamino-2-ethylazide (DMAZ) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethanediamine (TMEDA), have been identified as possible replacements for MMH. We have obtained genotoxicity data for these compounds from in vitro and in vivo studies. DMAZ did not produce any mutagenic effects at concentrations up to 5. mg/plate in the TA98 and TA1537 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in an Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA) strain, with or without metabolic activation, but did produce a positive response in the TA100 and TA1535 strains, both with and without metabolic activation. TMEDA was found not to be mutagenic in any of the bacterial strains tested (Salmonella TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and E. coli, WP2 uvrA), with or without metabolic activation. DMAZ did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations at levels up to 5. mg/mL in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with or without metabolic activation. TMEDA produced a positive response in this system, with or without metabolic activation, but only at the highest concentration, 5. mg/mL. However, according to the OECD guideline TG 473, the compound is considered to be negative in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, since the compound was not clastogenic at 0.01. M (1.140. mg/mL). DMAZ and TMEDA, when tested in vivo in the CD-1 mouse at doses up to 500 and 250. mg/kg, respectively, did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. These studies demonstrate that DMAZ is mutagenic in specific strains of Salmonella.

An analysis of the Bath school bombings of 1927, the largest pediatric terrorist disaster in U.S. history, provides an opportunity to gain perspective on pediatric patterns of injury and future disaster preparedness. Materials and Methods: Eighty-nine contemporary newspaper accounts, the official coroner's inquest, interviews, online resources, and the Michigan state archives of the disaster were reviewed with respect to the demographics, pattern of injury, gender, age, duration of hospitalization, relative distance of each classroom from the blast, and severity of injuries sustained using the Injury Severity Scale (ISS). Results: Eighty-seven children and three teachers were unable to safely evacuate the building; 36 children (41%) were dead on-site, 40 sustained mild injuries (76.9%), nine sustained moderate injuries (17.3%), and one sustained serious injuries (1.9%). Mean ISS scores decreased with increasing relative distance of each classroom from the primary blast, while the classrooms involved in structural collapse had the highest initial mortality and ISS score. Patterns of injury sustained imply a predominance of crush and penetrating trauma. Conclusions: Mean ISS scores and initial mortality by classroom were a function of proximity to the blast and structural collapse. The pattern of injury closely approximates those of other pediatric disasters such as Columbine, Oklahoma City, and 911. The absence of severe abdominal trauma and one reported hospital mortality may reflect an initial under-triage of patients, possibly due to the medical technology of the times. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Improved understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of these materials is needed in order to accurately assess the potential exposure risks and impacts on the environment and its ecosystems. We studied the toxicity of the nitroaromatic energetic material 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli L.

Amended soils were subjected to natural light conditions, and wetting and drying cycles in a greenhouse for 13weeks prior to toxicity testing to approximate field exposure conditions in terms of bioavailability, transformation, and degradation of 2,4-DNT. Definitive toxicity tests were performed according to standard protocols. The median effective concentration (EC50) values for shoot dry mass ranged from 8 to 229mg kg-1, depending on the plant species and soil type. Data indicated that 2,4-DNT was most toxic in the Sassafras (SSL) and Teller (TSL) sandy loam soils, with EC50 values for shoot dry mass ranging between 8 to 44mg kg-1, and least toxic in the Webster clay loam soil, with EC50 values for shoot dry mass ranging between 40 to 229mg kg-1. The toxicity of 2,4-DNT for each of the plant species was significantly (p≤0.05) and inversely correlated with the soil organic matter content.

RDX-contaminated groundwater was collected from the Pueblo Chemical Depot (CO, USA) and the Picatinny Arsenal (NJ, USA) where bioremediation technologies are being tested. Soil columns and enrichment cultures were derived from Picatinny Arsenal groundwater. Bacteria-specific primers were used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes that were used for phylogenetic analysis.

We found the highest degradation potential of RDX and its nitroso derivatives in the upper part of the soil profile while in the lower parts, RDX-degradation potential was lower and the nitroso derivatives tended to persist. This was also observed in the field, as reflected by the isotopic composition of RDX along the profile. We also found a correlation between biodegradation potential and clay content: biodegradation was further enhanced in layers characterized by high-clay content or in those influenced by the high-clay layers. In addition, in the presence of high organic matter content, further enhancement of biodegradation was observed. We obtained different isotopic enrichment factors (e{open}) for RDX biodegradation in different sections of the unsaturated profile and suggest that different degradation pathways exist simultaneously in situ, in variable proportions. Using the range of enrichment factors, we were able to assess the biodegradation extent of RDX at different sampling points along the profile, which ranged between 30 and 99.4%.

The results showed that in stagnant water there was a slow diffusion of the nitrobenzene from the pool leading to higher concentrations of the chemical deeper in the water column. In flowing water, the removal of the substance was rapid and water concentrations were much lower and more uniform throughout the column. The disturbance event brought a substantial quantity of nitrobenzene into the water column which then dissipated according to the flow regime.

The BET surface areas of ZVINs/SBA-15 (275.1m2g-1), as determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, was much larger than the non-stabilized ZVINs (82.0m2g-1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that iron in both ZVINs and ZVINs/SBA-15 was present mostly in the α-Fe0 crystalline form considered responsible for TNG degradation. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that iron nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of the nanosilica support. Both ZVINs and ZVINs/SBA-15 degraded TNG (100%) in water to eventually produce glycerol and ammonium. The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and was faster with ZVINs/SBA-15 (k1 0.83min-1) than with ZVINs (k1 0.228min-1). The corresponding surface-area normalized rate constants, knorm, were 0.36 and 0.33Lh-1m-2 for ZVINs/SBA-15 and ZVINs, respectively.

The chemical method was developed in a laboratory setting and demonstrated in a flow-through configuration using lightweight, inexpensive, commercial components by directly injecting the reagents into a continually flowing seawater stream using a small amount of organic solvent (approximately 8% of the total solution). Europium's vulnerability to vibrational fluorescence quenching by water provided the mode of detection. Without nitroglycerin in the seawater solution, the reagent's fluorescence was quenched, but when dissolved nitroglycerin was present, it displaced the water molecules from the europium/thenoyltrifluoroacetone compound and restored fluorescence. This effort focused on developing a seawater sensor, but performance comparisons were made to freshwater. The method was found to perform better in freshwater and it was shown that certain seawater constituents (such as calcium) have an adverse impact. However, the concentrations of these constituents are not expected to vary significantly from the natural seawater used herein. ©2010 with author.

The etiology of TBI, however, is poorly understood. Further study on the mechanisms and treatment of blast injury is urgently needed. We developed a unique rat model to simulate blast effects that commonly occur on the battlefield. An electric detonator with the equivalent of 400 mg TNT was developed as the explosive source. The detonator's peak overpressure and impulse of explosion shock determined the explosion intensity in a distance-dependent manner. Ninety-six male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: 5-cm, 7.5-cm, 10-cm, and control groups. The rat was fixed in a specially designed cabin with an adjustable aperture showing the frontal, parietal, and occipital parts of the head exposed to explosion; the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose were protected by the cabin. After each explosion, we assessed the physiologic, neuropathologic, and neurobehavioral consequences of blast injury. Changes of brain tissue water content and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression were detected. The results in the 7.5-cm group show that 87% rats developed apnea, limb seizure, poor appetite, and limpness. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and edema could be seen within the brain parenchyma, which showed a loss of integrity. Capillary damage and enlarged intercellular and vascular space in the cortex, along with a tattered nerve fiber were observed. These findings demonstrate that we have provided a reliable and reproducible blast-induced TBI model in rats. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-77953534684"

The use of high surfactant concentrations and long electrokinetic injections allows for improved detection limits. Sensitivity was enhanced by two mechanisms, improved stacking at the detector-side of the sample plug and desorption of analyte from the capillary wall by surfactant-containing BGE from the inlet side of the sample plug. Calculated limits of detection (S/N = 3) for analytes prepared in pure seawater were 70-800. ppb with injection times varying from 5 to 100. s. © 2010.","2-s2.0-77953541927"

Preliminary sediment quality benchmarks (SQBs) for MC were developed for screening potential risks to marine benthic invertebrates at a munitions contaminated sediment site in Puget Sound, WA, USA. SQBs were developed for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 13 breakdown products; six other explosive nitroaromatic compounds and nitramines (e.g., RDX, HMX); and five propellants, plasticizers, and stabilizers. The SQBs were developed using freshwater and limited marine aquatic toxicity values (and hence are considered preliminary) and equilibrium partitioning theory to relate water concentrations of the compounds to sediment concentrations. The SQBs are derived from the lowest available aquatic toxicity values for aquatic invertebrates from published reviews, original studies, and database sources; ranges of logKow and Koc values from published reviews and database sources, and some Koc values calculated from logKow. SQBs are presented for 25 MC as organic carbon-normalized values and as ranges of dry weight values for various levels of organic carbon content of sediments. Comparison of the preliminary SQBs with method detection limits and sample detection limits achieved at the contaminated sediment site demonstrates their utility in risk screening of benthic invertebrates. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-77957238316"

What is less well-known is the predictive relationship between particular dog behavioral traits (if any) and important working outcomes. Here we evaluate the validity of a dog behavioral test instrument given to military working dogs (MWDs) from the 341st Training Squadron, USA Department of Defense (DoD); the test instrument has been used historically to select dogs to be trained for deployment. A 15-item instrument was applied on three separate occasions prior to training in patrol and detection tasks, after which dogs were given patrol-only, detection-only, or dual-certification status. On average, inter-rater reliability for all 15 items was high (mean. = 0.77), but within this overall pattern, some behavioral items showed lower inter-rater reliability at some time points (<0.40). Test-retest reliability for most (but not all) single item behaviors was strong (>0.50) across shorter test intervals, but decreased with increasing test interval (<0.40). Principal components analysis revealed four underlying dimensions that summarized test behavior, termed here 'object focus', 'sharpness', 'human focus', and 'search focus'. These four aggregate behavioral traits also had the same pattern of short-, but not long-term test-retest reliability as that observed for single item behaviors. Prediction of certification outcomes using an independent test data set revealed that certification outcomes could not be predicted by breed, sex, or early test behaviors. However, prediction was improved by models that included two aggregate behavioral trait scores and three single item behaviors measured at the final test period, with 1 unit increases in these scores resulting in 1.7-2.8 increased odds of successful dual- and patrol-only certification outcomes. No improvements to odor-detection certification outcomes were made by any model. While only modest model improvements in prediction error were made by using behavioral parameters (2-7%), model predictions were based on data from dogs that had successfully completed all three test periods only, and therefore did not include data from dogs that were rejected during testing or training due to behavioral or medical reasons. Thus, future improvements to predictive models may be more substantial using independent predictors with less restrictions in range. Reports of the reliability and validity estimates of behavioral instruments currently used to select MWDs are scarce, and we discuss these results in terms of improving the efficiency by which working dog programs may select dogs for patrol and odor-detection duties using behavioral pre-screening instruments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77957126840"
