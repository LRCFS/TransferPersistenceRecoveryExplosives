Except for the Mg2+⋯π system with (E)-O2N-CH = CH-NO 2 (i.e., C2H2N2O4⋯ Mg2+), the strength of the trigger-bond X-NO2 (X = C, N or O) was enhanced upon complex formation. Furthermore, the increment of bond dissociation energy of the X-NO2 bond in the Na+ complex was far greater than that in the corresponding HF system. Thus, the explosive sensitivity in the former might be lower than that in the latter. For C 2H2N2O4⋯Mg2+, the explosive sensitivity might also be reduced. Therefore, it is possible that introducing cations into the structure of explosives might be more efficacious at reducing explosive sensitivity than the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen-bonded complex. AIM, NBO and electron density shifts analyses showed that the electron density shifted toward the X-NO2 bond upon complex formation, leading to a strengthened X-NO2 bond and possibly reduced explosive sensitivity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-84878760930"

The ability to control compositions and properties for such materials is also of interest since it can lead to optimal performance, controlled energy release, and low sensitivity. With these goals in mind, we focus our work on a high energy density material, 1,1-diamino-2,2- dinitroethylene (FOX-7). FOX-7 nanocrystals under confined conditions are synthesized in mesoporous carbon FDU-15 through self-assembly. Complete impregnation can be achieved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at 100-110 °C, and the maximum amount of FOX-7 in the FOX-7/FDU-15 composites is around 43.8 wt.% (C-43.8). Host-guest interactions are investigated by wide-angle XRD, 13C solid-state NMR, and FT-IR. C-43.8 shows low phase transition temperature and fast thermal decomposition rate compared with bulk FOX-7 crystals and the physical mixture. The host-guest structure of the composites demonstrates a novel and efficient space-insensitivity concept. C-43.8 shows no sensitivity toward both friction and impact, and insensitive to electrostatic spark (V50 > 37 kV; E50 > 20 J). The extreme insensitivity is closely related to the high thermal and mechanical stability of FDU-15. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84871819454"

THz excitation is associated with frequencies that are characteristically perturbative to molecular electronic states, in contrast to frequencies that can induce appreciable electronic state transition.

TATP decomposed rapidly and final decomposition was calculated before 200 C. Therefore, heat of decomposition (ΔH d) of TATP was evaluated to be 2,500 J g-1 by DSC under 2 C min-1 of heating rate. H2O2, acetone, and H2SO 4 should not be mixed in a wastewater drum. TATP decomposed at 50 C by DSC using O2 of reaction gas that is an exothermic reaction and can decompose a large amount of heat. Therefore, TATP was applied to assess thermal pyrolysis by DSC employing N2 of reaction gas that can analyze an endothermic reaction. Mass loss percentage of TATP was evaluated to be 100 % when the ambient temperature exceeds 110 C by TG using O2 or N2 of reaction gas. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-84880508826"

Liquid explosives are highly concentrated emulsions by their physical nature. During the internal phase, it is an aqueous supersaturated solution of mainly ammonium nitrate which is a useful component of a multi-component system, and at the continuous phase it is a solution of emulsifier in hydrocarbon oils. Liquid explosives demonstrate a complex set of properties characteristic for highly concentrated emulsions, such as visco-plasticity, existence of the yield stress, thixotropy (or time-dependent behavior), non-Newtonian flow at stresses exceeding the yield stress. Rheological properties depend on the concentration of internal phase, size of droplets, and the nature of the used surfactant. Stability of these materials is determined mainly by the tendency of an aqueous solution to crystallization at prolonged storage, though shearing does not influence on phase separation. Wall slip is absent in flow of liquid emulsions through tubes. Therefore, it allows us to make reliable predictions on the output vs. pressure dependence for real technological practice. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","2-s2.0-84872820550"

Both azido esters (1 and 2) show good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 233.5 C and 232.6 C. Their densities are measured to be 1.25 g/cm3 and 1.27 g/cm3, respectively. Glass transition temperature (T g) of both compounds 1 and 2 is -69 C and -68 C and after addition with binder shows reduction in Tg of polymer-plasticizer blends as compared to Tg of polymer only with single decomposition temperature values which indicate the presence of single phase homogeneous system.

The main objective of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of the concepts that lead to deformation and heating of energetic composites as they undergo mechanical and thermal processes subsequent to impact. A recently developed cohesive finite element method (CFEM) framework is used to study the microstructure-level response of PBX. The CFEM framework allows the contributions of individual constituents, fracture and frictional contact along failed crack surfaces to heating to be tracked and analyzed. Digitized micrographs of actual PBX materials are used. The issues studied include large deformation, thermomechanical coupling, failure in the forms of microcracks in both bulk constituents and along grain/matrix interfaces, and frictional heating.

The presence of extended conjugation and having two alkyloxy chains on phenyl rings induces flexibility to orient opposite to each other and interacts with another fluoranthene unit with weak π-π interactions and show unique supramolecular arrangements. The envisaged photophysical and DFT studies demonstrated that HOMO-LUMO levels were effectively tuned by different substituents with an optical band gap from 3.44 to 3.88 eV provoked to examine as sensitive fluorescent chemosensors for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). The sensitivity toward the detection of NACs was evaluated through fluorescence quenching in solution (aqueous and non-aqueous) and solid state (vapor and contact mode). Fluorescence studies demonstrated that electron transfer occurs from the electron rich fluoranthene fluorophores to the electron deficient NACs by the dominant static quenching mechanism and the quenching process is reversible. It was found that the detection sensitivity increases with extent of conjugation on fluoranthene unit. The contact mode approach using thin layer silica chromatographic plates exhibits a femtogram (1.15 fg/cm2) detection limit for trinitrotoluene (TNT) and picric acid (PA), while the solution state fluorescence quenching shows for PA detection at the 2-20 ppb level. The sensing performance of fluoranthene thin films to NACs in aqueous solution reveals that fluorophores are highly selective towards the detection of PA.

Because of their small size, hot-spots are difficult to experimentally interrogate, particularly for high volumetric strain rates (ε V > 10, 000 s - 1). In this study, simulations are performed for large ensembles of deformable particles (≈ 4000 particles) using a combined finite and discrete element technique to characterize statistical distributions of hot-spot intensity, geometry, and spatial proximity within and behind quasi-steady, piston supported uniaxial waves in granular HMX (C 4 H 8 N 8 O 8). Emphasis is placed on examining how the material's initial particle packing density, characterized by its effective solid volume fraction φ s, 0, affects hot-spot statistics for pressure dominated waves corresponding to piston speeds within the range 300 ≤ U p ≤ 500 m / s. Predictions indicate that hot-spot intensity is only marginally affected by initial porosity (1 - φ s, 0) for all piston speeds, whereas hot-spot size, number density, volume fraction, and volume specific surface area appreciably increase with porosity and exponentially increase with piston speed. Minor variations in particle shape are predicted to be largely inconsequential. Joint distributions of hot-spot intensity and size are combined with thermal explosion data to identify and examine critical hot-spots that quickly react behind waves. These results indicate that the observed increase in sensitivity with initial porosity for sustained loading is likely due to an increase in hot-spot size and number rather than intensity. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","2-s2.0-84878408363"

It was noticed that the crystal structure has significant effect on the initial activation energy distribution of CL-20, while in case of second stage (α = 0.30-0.85) this effect is relatively small, resulting in identical decomposition mechanism. Moreover, the kinetic compensation effects show that the studied materials could be divided into two groups, one including ε-CL-20, RS-ε-CL-20, α-CL-20, and ε-CL-20/C4 which decompose at solid state and another including ε-CL-20/Formex and RS-ε-CL-20/C4 which decompose at partial liquid state, resulting in different kinetic compensation effects. It reveals that the C4 base could affect the distribution of activation energy of ε-CL-20 and RS-ε-CL-20 in a totally different way. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-84880697282"

A shock initiation model of homogeneous explosives was established in the early 1960s. It involves a thermal explosion event at the shock entrance boundary, which develops into a superdetonation that overtakes the initial shock. In recent years, Sheffield and his group, using accurate experimental tools, were able to observe details of buildup of the superdetonation. There are many papers on modeling shock initiation of heterogeneous explosives, but there are only a few papers on modeling shock initiation of homogeneous explosives. In this article, bulk reaction reactive flow equations are used to model homogeneous shock initiation in an attempt to reproduce experimental data of Sheffield and his group. It was possible to reproduce the main features of the shock initiation process, including thermal explosion, superdetonation, input shock overtake, overdriven detonation after overtake, and the beginning of decay toward Chapman-Jouget (CJ) detonation. The time to overtake (TTO) as function of input pressure was also calculated and compared to the experimental TTO. © 2013 Copyright RAFAEL.","2-s2.0-84865236714"

Successful analysis of explosives is often of great help to the investigation and is indispensable for prosecuting persons for illegal possession of explosives.Various analytical methods have been used for the analysis of explosives: preliminary tests include burning, calorimetric, and chemical tests; chromatographic methods such as thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis, and ion chromatography; and spectroscopic or spectrometric methods such as infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry (MS), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, and x-ray diffraction. Hyphenated methods, usually on-line combination of chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (e.g., GC/MS, LC/MS), are powerful analytical techniques, which have become widely used in forensic laboratories.Postexplosion analysis is one of the most difficult topics in forensic science. Sampling in the scene, cleaning and extraction procedures, which are of paramount importance, are discussed.Because erroneous results in a forensic analysis may lead to a gross injustice, attention is given to the criteria required for the unequivocal positive identification of explosives in a forensic laboratory and to the problems associated with the interpretation of results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been shown that both increasing electron donating strength and extending conjugation are effective approaches to improve the photochemical stability of the oligothiophene. Fluorescence studies demonstrated that the emission of the 3T derivatives is sensitive to the presence of some important nitro-containing explosives in their ethanol solution, in particular, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA) and 3,5-dinitro-2,6-bispicrylamino pyridine (PYX). As an example, the detection limits of 4 to PA and PYX were determined to be 6.21×10-7mol/L and 8.95×10-7mol/L, respectively. Based on the discovery, a colorimetric detection method has been developed. The sensitive and selective response of the modified 3T to the explosives have been tentatively attributed to the adsorptive affinity of the compounds to the explosives, and to the higher probability of the electron transfer from the electron-rich 3T derivatives to the electron-poor nitro-containing explosives.

A two-step mechanism has been found for thermal decomposition of α-CL-20, ε-CL-20/C4, and RS-ε-CL-20/C4, where the initial step is partly controlled by crystal structure of CL-20. The more reasonable mean activation energies could be obtained after peak separation for each individual steps. In fact, the activation energy for the post integrated process is almost equivalent with that of the second step, indicating that the total activation energy at the main decomposition process is dominated by thermolysis of CL-20 molecular. Besides, it has been found that the decomposition of C4 matrix does not affect the decomposition of normal ε-CL-20, resulting in identical activation energy and reaction model. However, the interaction between the C4 matrix and RS-ε-CL-20 is significant especially at the initial stage, where the activation energy of RS-ε-CL-20/C4 was overestimated before peak separation, while the activation energy for the second step due to thermolysis of CL-20 molecular is underestimated. The first decomposition step for α-CL-20, ε-CL-20/C4, and RS-ε-CL-20/C4 could be considered as autocatalytic process (AC model), whereas the second as JMA model, which is also applicable to that of pure ε-CL-20 and RS-ε-CL-20.

TNT was diluted in six different solvents (acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, and toluene), which allowed for a direct comparison of absorption features over a wide range of concentrations. A line-shape analysis was adopted with great accuracy (R 2 > 0.99) to model the absorption features of TNT in differential reflectivity spectra. We observed a blue shift in the pertinent absorption band with decreasing TNT concentration for all solvents. Moreover, using this technique, it was found that for all utilized solvents the concentration of TNT as well as of RDX, HMX, and tetryl, measured as a function of the transition wavelength of the ultra-violet absorption edge in differential reflectivity spectra shows three distinct regions.

Significant levels of these degradation products were observed in post-explosion samples, whereas only very low levels were detected in a variety of intact PETN samples and naturally degraded PETN. No significant degradation was observed after 12 weeks of storage at room temperature and the influence of high relative humidity (90%) was found to be small. Natural degradation was accelerated by storage of small amounts of PETN on different types of textile, resembling the clothing of a suspect, at elevated temperature (333. K). This resulted in significant levels of PETN degradation products, but the relative amounts remained much lower than in post-explosion PETN. For PETriN the peak area relative to PETN was 0.014 (SD=0.0051) and 0.39 (SD=0.19) respectively. Based on the peak areas of PETriN, PEDiN and PEMN relative to PETN, it was possible to fully distinguish the post-explosion profiles from the profiles obtained from intact PETN or after (accelerated) natural degradation.Although more data are required to accurately assess the strength of the evidence, this work illustrates that PETN profiling may yield valuable evidence when investigating a possible link between a suspect and post-explosion PETN found on a crime scene.

This is due to the inorganic nature of the thermite components and because the reaction involves interparticular heat and matter transfers. In addition, during the progressive decomposition of nanothermites, there is no change in mass, so it cannot be observed by thermogravimetric analysis. The use of laser ignition to prime the abrupt combustion of nanothermite pellets allows determining the ignition energy and analyzing the propagation of the combustion front. It also provides qualitative data that can be used to understand the combustion mechanism and to correlate it to the microstructure of the nanothermites. By analyzing several examples, we will show that the coupling of high speed video to existing thermal analysis techniques could significantly extend their utilization range for the characterization of new energetic materials. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-84872493482"

The absorption and release of vapors of the (deuterated) TNT analogue 4-nitrotoluene (pNT) from thin films of the dendrimers were studied with a combination of time-correlated neutron reflectometry and PL spectroscopy. When saturated with pNT the PL of the films was fully quenched and could not be recovered with flowing nitrogen at room temperature but only upon heating to 40-80 °C. Although the majority of the absorbed pNT could be removed with this method the recovered films were found to still contain a residual pNT concentration of ∼0.1 molecules per cubic nanometer. However, the proportion of the PL recovered increased with generation with the third generation dendrimer exhibiting close to full recovery despite the presence of residual pNT. This result is attributed to a combination of two effects. First, the dendrimer films present a range of binding sites for nitroaromatic molecules with the stronger binding sites surviving the thermal recovery process. Second, there is a large decrease of the exciton diffusion coefficient with dendrimer generation, preventing migration of the excitation to the remaining bound pNT. © 2013 the Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-84878701470"

The prepared compounds, including energetic salts of 1-hydroxy-5-aminotetrazole (hydroxylammonium (2, two polymorphs) and ammonium (3)), azo-coupled derivatives (potassium (5), hydroxylammonium (6), ammonium (7), and hydrazinium 5,5′-azo-bis(1-N-oxidotetrazolate (8, two polymorphs)), as well as neutral compounds 5,5′-azo-bis(1-oxidotetrazole) (4) and 5,5′-bis(1-oxidotetrazole)hydrazine (9), were intensively characterized by low-temperature X-ray diffraction, IR, Raman, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and DSC. The calculated energetic performance, by using the EXPLO5 code, based on the calculated (CBS-4M) heats of formation and X-ray densities confirm the high energetic performance of tetrazole-N-oxides as energetic materials.

Portable CE systems enable this powerful analysis technique to be used in the field. Many of the challenges for portable systems are similar to those of autonomous in-situ analysis and therefore portable systems may be considered a stepping stone towards autonomous in-situ analysis. CE is widely used for biological and chemical analysis and example applications include: water quality analysis; drug development and quality control; proteomics and DNA analysis; counter-terrorism (explosive material identification) and corrosion monitoring. The technique is often limited to laboratory use, since it requires large electric fields, sensitive detection systems and fluidic control systems. All of these place restrictions in terms of: size, weight, cost, choice of operating solutions, choice of fabrication materials, electrical power and lifetime. In this review we bring together and critique the work by researchers addressing these issues.

Exothermal behavior of ADN decomposition was measured by isothermal tests using high-sensitive calorimetry (TAM) and non-isothermal tests using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Based on these results, analysis of the decomposition kinetics was conducted. The activation energy determined by TAM tests was lower than that from DSC tests. Thus, the decomposition path in TAM tests was different from that in DSC tests.

Honeybees have been used both as biosensors, because the pesticides affect their viability, and as ""contaminant collectors"" for all environmental pollutants. We focused our research on the development of analytical procedures able to reveal and quantify pesticides in different samples but with a special attention to the complex honeybee matrix. Specific extraction and purification procedures have been developed and some are still under optimization. The analytes of interest were determined by gas or liquid chromatographic methods and by compound-specific or group-specific immunoassays in the ELISA format, the analytical performance of which was improved by introducing luminescence detection. The range of chemiluminescent immunoassays developed was extended to include the determination of completely different pollutants, for example explosives, volatile organic compounds (including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes), and components of plastics, for example bisphenol A. An easier and portable format, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was added to the ELISA format to increase application flexibility in these assays.

Mathematical stability analysis is used to identify and track the oscillatory instability, which may be violent. In the mild oscillatory regime it is shown that, in principle, the oscillatory thermal signal may be used in microcalorimetry to detect and identify explosives.

HTC of nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing materials produces unintended byproduct gases that could affect isotope analyses by: (1) allowing isotope exchange reactions downstream of the HTC reactor, (2) creating isobaric or co-elution interferences, and (3) causing deterioration of the chromatography. This study characterizes these HTC byproducts. METHODS A HTC system (ThermoFinnigan TC/EA) was directly connected to a gas chromatograph/quadrupole mass spectrometer in scan mode (m/z 8 to 88) to identify the volatile products generated by HTC at conversion temperatures of 1350 °C and 1450°C for a range of nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing solids [keratin powder, horse hair, caffeine, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, urea, and three nitrated organic explosives (PETN, RDX, and TNT)]. RESULTS The prominent HTC byproduct gases include carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane, acetylene, and water for all nitrogen-bearing compounds, as well as carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide for sulfur-bearing compounds. The 1450°C reactor temperature reduced the abundance of most byproduct gases, but increased the significant byproduct, hydrogen cyanide. Inclusion of a post-reactor chemical trap containing Ascarite II and Sicapent, in series, eliminated the majority of byproducts. CONCLUSIONS This study identified numerous gaseous HTC byproducts. The potential adverse effects of these gases on isotope ratio analyses are unknown but may be mitigated by higher HTC reactor temperatures and purifying the products with a purge-and-trap system or with chemical traps.

Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) is a nitramine compound that is well known as an energetic material. The burning characteristics of HMX-based composite propellants have been investigated, but the experimental data collected thus far is not sufficient to reveal the combustion mechanism. In this study, the burning characteristics of HMX-based propellants were measured using three HMX samples, each with different particle sizes, and six propellant formulations of each sample with HMX content varying from 55% to 80%. Then, the relationship of HMX particle size and content with the burning rate characteristics was revealed. The burning rate decreased and the pressure deflagration limit increased as the HMX content decreased. The pressure exponent increased as the particle diameter increased and the HMX content decreased. The propellant prepared with small HMX particles underwent steady-state combustion, and the burning surface was nearly flat. On the other hand, the burning surface of the propellant containing coarse HMX particles was very rough and coarse particles protruded from the burning surface. The protruding coarse HMX particles generated remarkable flashing flames. The flashing flames and rugged burning surface caused strong heterogeneous combustion in the vicinity of the burning surface. The burning rates at high pressure were barely dependent on the particle diameter, but those at low pressure decreased with increasing particle diameter. It was found that the HMX content, particle diameter, and pressure were the dominant factors in the assessment of the effects of particle size. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The PCF module has three primary components. The first is a high-volume sampler, comprising a resistively-heated 6-cm long stainless steel tube packed with tandem beds of the graphitized carbons Carbopack B (C-B, 30. mg) and Carbopack Y (C-Y, 15. mg), which traps the markers but permits more volatile interferences to pass through largely unretained.

An approach is developed to computationally predict and quantify the stochasticity of the ignition process in polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under impact loading. The method, the computational equivalent of carrying out multiple experiments under the same conditions, involves subjecting sets of statistically similar microstructure samples to identical overall loading and characterizing the statistical distribution of the ignition response of the samples. Specific quantities predicted based on basic material properties and microstructure attributes include the critical time to ignition at given load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition occurs. The analyses carried out focus on the influence of random microstructure geometry variations on the critical time to ignition at given load intensity and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition occurs. Results show that the probability distribution of the time to criticality (tc) follows the Weibull distribution. This probability distribution is quantified as a function of microstructural attributes including grain volume fraction, grain size, specific binder-grain interface area, and the stochastic variations of these attributes. The relations reveal that the specific binder-grain interface area and its stochastic variation have the most influence on the critical time to ignition and the critical impact velocity below which no ignition is observed. For a PBX with 95 octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7- tetrazocine content, the computationally predicted minimum impact velocity for ignition is in the range of 54-63 ms-1 depending on microstructure.

Especially in the field of detection of explosives and improvised explosive devices, several relevant compounds exhibit a very low vapor pressure. Ambient pressure laser desorption is proposed to make these substances available in the gas phase for the detection by adapted mass spectrometers or in the future with ion-mobility spectrometry as well. In contrast to the state-of-the-art thermal desorption approach, by which the sample surface is probed for explosive traces by a wipe pad being transferred to a thermal desorber unit, by the ambient pressure laser desorption approach presented here, the sample is directly shockwave ablated from the surface. The laser-dispersed molecules are sampled by a heated sniffing capillary located in the vicinity of the ablation spot into the mass analyzer. This approach has the advantage that the target molecules are dispersed more gently than in a thermal desorber unit where the analyte molecules may be decomposed by the thermal intake. In the technical realization, the sampling capillary as well as the laser desorption optics are integrated in the tip of an endoscopic probe or a handheld sampling module. Laboratory as well as field test scenarios were performed, partially in cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA, Wiesbaden, Germany), in order to demonstrate the applicability for various explosives, drugs, and drug precursors.

The overall objective of the research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the gas phase ionization processes in the ITMS based ETD to facilitate the advancement of its operational effectiveness as well as guide the development of next generation ETDs. Product ion masses, daughter ion masses, and reduced mobility values measured by the ITMS/MS/MS configuration for a suite of nitro, nitrate, and peroxide containing explosives are reported. Molecular formulas, molecular structures, and ionization pathways for the various product ions are inferred using the mass and mobility data in conjunction with density functional theory. The predominant product ions are identified as follows: [TNT-H]- for trinitrotoluene (TNT), [RDXCl]- for cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX), [NO3]- for ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), [NGNO3]- for nitroglycerine (NG), [PETNNO 3]- for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), [HNO 3NO3]- for ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO3), [HMTD-NC3H6O 3HCl]- for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), and [(CH3)2CNH2] for triacetone triperoxide (TATP).

Surface sample compensation was performed with low-energy electrons (500 eV, 0.75 mA). RESULTS TNT, RDX, PETN and cloratite were deposited in powdered form on double-sided tape and introduced into the mass spectrometer, without further handling, for SIMS analysis.

The absence of electron-withdrawing nitro groups in DAE results in the transformation of the structure, which makes the absence of N-Hpi; hydrogen bond in DAE(1)-acetylene.

Among the range of different frequencies for electromagnetic excitation, the THz frequency range is of particular interest because of its nondestructive nature. The present study is based on significant progress in density functional theory (DFT), and associated software technology, which is sufficiently mature for the determination of dielectric response functions, and actually provides complementary information to that obtained from experiment. This point is further demonstrated in this study by calculations of ground state resonance structure associated with molecular clusters of the high explosives PETN and TNT using DFT, which is for the construction of parameterized dielectric response functions for excitation by electromagnetic waves at frequencies within the THz range. These dielectric functions provide for different types of analyses concerning the dielectric response of explosives. In particular, these dielectric response functions provide quantitative initial estimates of spectral response features for subsequent adjustment with respect to additional information such as laboratory measurements and other types of theory-based calculations. With respect to qualitative analysis, these spectra provide for the molecular level interpretation of response structure.

The strong donor-acceptor (D-A) interactions between EDA and trinitrotoluene (TNT) at the Au NP/solution interface induced significant aggregation of the EDA-capped Au NPs, and enabled to easily realize the direct colorimetric detection of ultratrace TNT. The results showed that such a color change was readily seen by the naked eye, and the colorimetric detection could be down to 400. pM level of TNT with excellent discrimination against other nitro compounds. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to examine the TNT-induced changes in local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of EDA-capped Au NPs, and a new LSPR band at ca. 630. nm arose along with the addition of TNT, which produced a detection limit of TNT down to ca. 40. pM. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering measurements evidenced the ultratrace TNT-induced small changes in the size of the EDA-capped Au NPs, and realized the quick and accurate detection of TNT in 0.4. pM level. These results demonstrated the ultrahigh sensitivity of this optical probe for TNT detection.

The pressure exponent (η) plays a significant role in the internal ballistics of rocket motors. Nitramines are known to produce lower burning rates and higher pressure exponent (η) values. Studies on the burning rate and combustion behavior of advanced high-energy NG/PE-PCP/AP/Al- and NG/PE-PCP/HMX/AP/Al-based solid rocket propellants processed by a conventional slurry cast route were carried out. The objective of present study was to understand the effectiveness of various ballistic modifiers viz. iron oxide, copper chromite, lead/copper oxides, and lead salts in combination with carbon black as a catalyst on the burning rate and pressure exponent of these high-energy propellants. A 7-9 % increase in the burning rates and almost no effect in pressure exponent values of propellant compositions without nitramine were observed. However, in case of nitramine-based propellants as compared to propellant compositions without nitramines, slight increases of the burning rates were observed. By incorporation of ballistic modifiers, the pressure exponents can be lowered. The changes in the calorimetric values of the formulations by addition of the catalysts were also studied.

The coupled thermal-electromagnetic interaction evolved within the powder prior to its ignition is simulated theoretically, taking into account the powder's temperature-dependent parameters. The simulation results show a thermal-runaway instability and localized heating within a confined hotspot, induced mostly by the microwave's electric-field component. The experimental setup employs accordingly an open-end applicator implemented by a miniature solid-state microwave-drill device inserted into the thermite powder as a local igniter.

The films were prepared using acetone-dissolved TNT by simple spin coating deposition technique. Unlike traditional mass loss techniques, this new method is independent of the surface area of the sample which contributes to errors in determining physical parameters accurately in both bulk and thin films of materials. The calculated activation energy and temperature- dependent sublimation rates agree well with the reported values for TNT thin films.

The acceptor phase (as derivatization reagent) containing o-phthaldehyde and sodium sulfite was held within a syringe barrel and immersed in the headspace of sample container. The gaseous ammonia from the alkalized aqueous sample formed a stable isoindole derivative with the acceptor phase inside the syringe barrel through the reciprocated movements of plunger. After derivatization-cum-extraction, the acceptor phase was directly injected into LC-FLD for analysis. Parameters affecting the ammonia evolution and the extraction/derivatization efficiency such as sample matrix, pH, temperature, sampling time, and the composition of derivatization reagent, reaction temperature, and frequency of reciprocated plunger, were studied thoroughly. Results indicated that the maximum extraction efficiency was obtained by using 100μL derivatization reagent in a 1-mL gastight syringe under 8 reciprocated movements of plunger per min to extract ammonia evolved from a 20mL alkalized aqueous solution at 70°C (preheated 4min) with 380rpm stirring for 8min. The detection was linear in the concentration range of 0.625-10μM with the correlation coefficient of 0.9967 and detection limit of 0.33μM (5.6ngmL-1) based on SN-1=3. The method was applied successfully to determine ammonium in real water samples without any prior cleanup of the samples, and has been proved to be a simple, sensitive, efficient and cost-effective procedure for trace ammonium determination in aqueous samples. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84868680060"

Hydrogen bonds are speculated to be the main driving force. Complete impregnation can be achieved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at 100-110 °C, which optimizes the interaction of organic molecule with matrix, and the maximum loading amount is around 42.8 wt.%. Structural characterization is provided by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, N 2 sorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The formation of a new metastable phase of PA is supported by wide-angle XRD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, and it is believed that this phase can only be stable in confined conditions.

The selected pi-conjugated fluorescent material was a phenylene-ethynylene diimine with di-ether substituents (PH-DE-DI). A rapid disappearance of the fluorescence emission occurred when the material was exposed to solar light in ambient air. To understand this degradation, modifications to the chemical structure of thin films exposed to UV-visible irradiation were characterised using various techniques. HS-SPME-GC-MS experiments showed that sample irradiation induced the release of numerous volatile products in a relatively high abundance. IR spectroscopy coupled with derivatisation treatments allowed the identification of the photoproducts trapped in the irradiated thin films. To improve the understanding of the degradation mechanism of PH-DE-DI, the present paper also focused on the photo-ageing of phenylene-ethynylene materials: (i) without the end diimine function and the di-ether groups and (ii) the PH-DE-DI polymer. Based on the identification of several photoproducts, the primary pathways of photodegradation involving a chain radical oxidation process were discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that there are evident LP(N or O; LP=lone pair)→σ*(N-H) orbital interactions related to O·H-N or N·H-N hydrogen bonds. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) was applied to characterize the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. For the guanidinium salts studied, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds are associated with a seven- or eight-membered pseudo-ring. The guanylurea cation is more helpful for improving the thermal stabilities of the ionic salts than other guanidinium cations. The contributions of different substituents on the triazine ring to the thermal stability increase in the order of -NO 2<-NF 2<-N 3 (-ONO 2)<-NH 2. Energy decomposition analysis shows that the salts are stable owing to electrostatic and orbital interactions between the ions, whereas the dispersion energy has very small contributions. Moreover, the salts exhibit relatively high densities in the range of 1.62-1.89 g cm -3. The detonation velocities and pressures lie in the range of 6.49-8.85 km s -1 and 17.79-35.59 GPa, respectively, which makes most of them promising explosives.

Failure of PBX caused by mechanical damage is one of the sources of accidental ignitions. A brittle crack of PBX produces local heating, creating a 'hot spot' finally. Investigation into the tensile fracture behaviour of PBX is one of the main works to determine the failure mechanism. Although many researchers have carried out the quasi-static Brazilian test to understand the damage evolution of PBX, the fracture feature of PBX under dynamic impact is rarely reported. In this article, dynamic Brazilian tests were conducted. A single-pulse loading apparatus was used to ensure that specimen was loaded only once during a dynamic Brazilian test. High-speed camera, digital image correlation and micro-observation techniques were adopted for strain measurement and microfracture observation. All the dynamic tensile crack exhibits transgranular fracture, which indicates more heat would released by the propagation of crack and more friction between fractured crystal surfaces. On the basis of the theories of interface debonding and transgranular fracture, larger crystals are more prone to crack, whereas smaller crystals simply debond with neighbouring binders. Discrete element method simulation results show that specimen with interface debonding microcracks was able to sustain additional load until transgranular fracture begins. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-84869488664"

The FEL provides support and advice to the Home Office and UK police forces on matters relating to the criminal misuse of explosives. During 1989 the FEL established a weekly quality assurance testing regime in its explosives trace analysis laboratory. The purpose of the regime is to prevent the accumulation of explosives traces within the laboratory at levels that could, if other precautions failed, result in the contamination of samples and controls. Designated areas within the laboratory are swabbed using cotton wool swabs moistened with ethanol:water mixture, in equal amounts. The swabs are then extracted, cleaned up and analysed using Gas Chromatography with Thermal Energy Analyser detectors or Liquid Chromatography with triple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry. This paper follows on from two previous published papers which described the regime and summarised results from approximately 14. years of tests. This paper presents results from the subsequent 7. years setting them within the context of previous results. It also discusses further improvements made to the systems and procedures and the inclusion of quality assurance sampling for the peroxide explosives TATP and HMTD. Monitoring samples taken from surfaces within the trace laboratories and trace vehicle examination bay have, with few exceptions, revealed only low levels of contamination, predominantly of RDX. Analysis of the control swabs, processed alongside the monitoring swabs, has demonstrated that in this environment the risk of forensic sample contamination, assuming all the relevant anti-contamination procedures have been followed, is so small that it is considered to be negligible. The monitoring regime has also been valuable in assessing the process of continuous improvement, allowing sources of contamination transfer into the trace areas to be identified and eliminated. © 2012.","2-s2.0-84867649467"

Compared with conventional matrixes such as a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), NEDN provides a significant improvement in detection sensitivity and yields very few matrixassociated fragment and cluster ions interfering with MS analysis.

Additionally, the mass spectra in the lower mass range (m/zG200) consist of only nitrate and nitric acid cluster ions, making the matrix particularly useful for structural identification of oligosaccharides by post-source decay (PSD) MALDI-MS.

The explosives with both high energy densities and low sensitivities, or the so-called insensitive high explosives (IHEs), are desirable in most cases. It seems from applied explosives that amino groups are advantageous to IHE but the amount of amino groups contained IHEs is very limited. To make this clear, we present systemic examinations of the effects on the two properties stressed in IHEs after introducing amino groups to different molecular skeletons. As a result, the amino groups on resonant sites to nitro groups in conjugated systems can improve distinctly sensitivities and change energy densities in terms of oxygen balance; while the amino groups in unconjugated systems can hardly increase energy densities and usually cause increased sensitivities. It agrees well with a fact that almost all the molecules of applied amino group contained explosives possess conjugated skeletons.We therefore confirm that if amino groups are introduced resonantly to a nitro group in a conjugated system and the introduction improves OB, they are advantageous to IHEs. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","2-s2.0-84870482441"

Analysis of resolved shear stress induced by uniaxial compression along three shock directions normal to (110), (011), and (010) planes leads to identify eight slip systems as candidates for shear deformation. For each of the eight slip systems, non-equilibrium reactive dynamics simulations were carried out to determine thermal, mechanical, and chemical responses to shear deformation. Shock direction normal to (010) plane exhibits large shear stress barriers arising from steric hindrance between molecules of adjacent layers leading to local dramatic energy and temperature increases under shear flow that in turn accelerate chemical bond breaking and initial product formation processes, promoting further molecular decomposition and eventually transition to detonation. This suggests that single crystal β-HMX is sensitive to shocks in direction normal to (010) plane. Shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes reveal significantly less steric hindrance, leading to more modest energy and temperature increases followed by slower chemical reaction initiation. Thus, shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes are less sensitive than shock direction normal to (010) plane, which agree with interpretations from currently available plate impact experiments on HMX. This validation of CS-RD and ReaxFF for characterizing sensitivity of single crystal energetic materials indicates that these methods can be applied to study sensitivity for more complex polymer bonded explosives and solid composite propellants having complex microstructures, corrugated interfaces, as well as defects. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-84863520768"

Vapor sources for continuous-flow generators are typically explosives compounds supported on a solid support, or compounds contained in a permeation or diffusion device. Sources are held at elevated isothermal temperatures. Similar sources can be used for pulsed vapor generators; however, pulsed systems may also use injection of solutions onto heated surfaces with generation of both solvent and explosives vapors, transient peaks from a gas chromatograph, or vapors generated by programmed thermal desorption.

However, for many applications, especially for trace analysis, it is of interest to improve the sensitivity of DESI-mass spectrometry (MS). METHODS In traditional DESI-MS, a mixture of methanol/water/acetic acid is usually used to generate the primary ions. In this article, dilute protein solutions were electrosprayed in the DESI method to create multiply charged primary ions for the desorption ionization of trace analytes on various surfaces (e.g., filter paper, glass, Al-foil) without any sample pretreatment. The analyte ions were then detected and structurally characterized using a LTQ XL mass spectrometer. RESULTS Compared with the methanol/water/acetic acid (49:49:2, v/v/v) solution, protein solutions significantly increased the signal levels of non-volatile compounds such as benzoic acid, TNT, o-toluidine, peptide and insulin in either positive or negative ion detection mode. For all the analytes tested, the limits of detection (LODs) were reduced to about half of the original values which were obtained using traditional DESI. The results showed that the signal enhancement is highly correlated with the molecular weight of the proteins and the selected solid surfaces. CONCLUSIONS The proposed DESI method is a universal strategy for rapid and sensitive detection of trace amounts of strongly bound and/or non-volatile analytes, including explosives, peptides, and proteins. The results indicate that the sensitivity of DESI can be further improved by selecting larger proteins and appropriate solid surfaces. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-84868364764"

The cage strain energies of polynitroadamantanes and polynitrocubanes increase gradually with the increase of the nitro-substituted number. However, the increase of the cage strain energies of polynitroadamantanes is less drastic than that of polynitrocubanes; on the contrary, the decrease of the bond dissociation energies of C-NO 2 bonds in the former compounds is more rapidly than the latter. Accordingly, the cage strain energies and bond dissociation energies of C-NO 2 bonds play different roles in determining the stability of high-energy compounds. An increase in the number of nitro groups may be advantageous to the performance and oxygen balance, but disadvantageous to the stability; an increase of cage strain energy may result in a decrease of stability, but more energy will release when a cage opening occurs. Rational number of nitro groups and proper cage strain energy are indispensable for an ideal nitro-containing explosive with high energy but insensitive to external impact.

According to risk assessment and analysis methodologies, risk assessment of TATP for the environmental and human safety issue was evaluated as 2-level of hazard probability rating (P) and 6-level of severity of consequences ratings (S).

The influence of different metal centers of the connector was evaluated. For particular IRMOF-1 clusters, used small IRMOF-1(Zn) fragments are reported to have higher binding affinity than such components of IRMOF-1(Be), and their interactions with TATP are favored compared with the RDX systems. The binding efficiency is also influenced by the presence of linkers. One benzene linker connected with a Be-O-C cluster was found to have the lowest binding energy for the target molecules when compared with larger fragments containing more linkers.

A decrease in the surface area, as well as morphology changes, in PETN has been observed during aging. Commercially, water is used in the production of PETN which suggests an uninvestigated stability control factor. In this article, single crystals of PETN were grown by solvent evaporation method from acetone at room temperature in absence and presence of different weight ratios of de-ionized water. The effect of presence of water in the starting solution of PETN on its thermodynamic properties was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning Calorimetry. The TGA study suggests an important role for water in manipulating thermodynamic parameters of PETN via the expected hydrogen bonding. The DSC results suggest the presence of bound water molecules as impurity in PETN single crystals. The data could be used to form PETN crystals with desired physical properties optimal for either storage or initiation. This study suggests that, in the equilibrium conditions, water could be used in a cheap, tunable, and precise manner to control the stability of PETN crystals against coarsening. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Samples were prepared in the form of pellets (pressed powders), thread-like monocrystals and thin plate polycrystals. A special laser complex was used to perform the experiments. It provided multiparameter measuring of different processes in explosive decomposition of samples. These processes are glowing of decomposing sample, glowing from the irradiated area only, sample acoustic response, shape and energy of a laser pulse. The time resolution for all the experiments made 5 ns and synchronization accuracy made 10 ns. It was found that silver azide demonstrates high sensitivity to laser radiation in its transparent spectral region (1064 nm and 532 nm). The explosion initiation energy threshold made 4-8 mJ/cm 2 for both pressed powders with the free surface and for samples with the covered and pressed by a quartz plate surface. Silver azide crystals require approximately 10 times higher energy density to explode. When the samples were acted by UV laser radiation, their sensitivity was from 50 to 500 times lower for the uncovered samples. The covered and pressed samples demonstrated the sensitivity which was close to that for acted by 1064 nm laser radiation. Equal sensitivity of samples to laser radiation with different wavelengths testifies to non-photochemical nature of explosion initiation.

Compared with the demands of other He-requiring ambient pressure ionization sources, the consumption of helium by the HePI source is minimal (20-30 ml/min). Quantification experiments conducted by exposing solid deposits to a HePI source revealed that 1 ng of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) on a filter paper (about 0.01 ng/mm2) could be detected by this method. When vapor emanating from a 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) sample was subjected to helium plasma ionization mass spectrometry (HePI-MS), a peak was observed at m/z 268 for (RDX•NO2)-. This facile formation of NO2- adducts was noted without the need of any extra additives as dopants. Quantitative evaluations showed RDX detection by HePI-MS to be linear over at least three orders of magnitude. TNT samples placed even 5 m away from the source were detected when the sample headspace vapor was swept by a stream of argon or nitrogen and delivered to the helium plasma ion source via a metal tube. Among the tubing materials investigated, stainless steel showed the best performance for sample delivery.

The non-isothermal kinetics of APX was calculated by using the differential isoconversional method based on thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analyzer results. It was found that with the extent of conversion increase, the activation energy increase from 136.6 kJ/mol to the highest value of 294.0 kJ/mol at the conversion of 40%, and then decrease to 248.2 kJ/mol; In addition, the decomposition mechanism of APX was systematically studied by in situ pyrolytic Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron impact ionization analysis and density functional theory. The final decomposition products of APX were conformed to include N 2O, NO 2, CONH, H 2CO, etc. The lowest bond dissociation energy of APX is NN bonds and these may be decomposed initially. Finally, the most probable decomposition pathway based on the N6N7 bond homolysis was proposed and the theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because they are in the form of salts, their relatively low volatility makes them difficult to detect at trace levels. In addition, these salts readily undergo metathetic reactions in water to form urea, ammonium and nitrate, which are ubiquitous in the environment. Thus, selective methods are needed for their detection. In this study, a procedure was developed to detect UN and AN in non-aqueous environments by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry through the addition of 18-crown-6. The method is sensitive, with detection limits under 2 μM, and selective. The procedure is capable of differentiating urea from uronium ions (protonated urea) and a mixture of urea and AN did not interfere with the UN signal. The procedure is quite versatile and the addition of crown ethers to the sample matrix does not interfere with the detection of high explosives in the negative ionization mode. Experimental results are presented on the utilization of the method in the detection of UN and AN on various surfaces. Semi-quantitative studies showed that AN and UN can be detected at trace levels following finger transfer and a series of studies were performed to demonstrate the effect of various interferences.

PETN has received major attention as an insensitive, high energy explosive; however, the mechanism and dynamics of the decomposition of this material are not clear yet. The initial decomposition mechanism of PETN is explored with nanosecond energy resolved spectroscopy and quantum chemical theory employing the ONIOM algorithm at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. The nitric oxide (NO) molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from PETN at three UV excitation wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm) with a pulse duration of 8 ns. Energies of the three excitation wavelengths coincide with the (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) vibronic bands of the NO A 2Σ+ ← X 2Π electronic transition, respectively. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for PETN, which generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (∼20 K) and a vibrationally hot (∼1300 K) distribution. Potential energy surface calculations at the ONIOM(CASSCF:UFF) level of theory illustrate that conical intersections play an important role in the decomposition mechanism. Electronically excited S1 PETN returns to the ground state through the (S1S0)CI conical intersection, and undergoes a nitro-nitrite isomerization to generate the NO product. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.","2-s2.0-80155147844"

The series of QDs was investigated with respect to their ability to donate excited-state electrons to an electronwithdrawing explosive related compound (ERC). Electron transfer was monitored by observing the steady-state fluorescence signal and the excited-state lifetimes of the QDs in the presence of ERC1. Increased sensitivities of QDs towards ERC1 were observed as the size and emission wavelength of the QDs decreased. As the QDs size decreased, the Stern-Volmer quenching constants increased. The larger QD exhibited the lowest Ksv and is thought to be quenched by a purely static quenching mechanism. As QD size decreased, an additional collisional quenching mechanism was introduced, denoted by a non-linearity in the quenching-vs-concentration Stern-Volmer plot. Increases in quenching efficiency were due to increased excited-state lifetimes, and the introduction of a collisional quenching mechanism.

However, an inverse relationship was observed between the particle diameter and the RDX:TNT mass transfer rate coefficient ratio for dry-attritted particles, which suggests that RDX may be more readily dissolved (relative to TNT) in microscale particles compared to macroscale particles. Aqueous weathering of larger Composition B residues generated particles that possessed mass transfer coefficients that were on the order of 5- to 20-fold higher than dry-attritted particles of all sizes, even when normalized to particle surface area. These aqueous weathered particles also possessed a fourfold lower absolute zeta-potential than dry-attritted particles, which is indicative that they were less hydrophobic (and hence, more wettable) than dry-attritted particles. The increased wettability of these particles provides a plausible explanation for the observed enhanced dissolution. The wetting history and the processes by which particles are produced (e.g., dry physical attrition vs. aqueous weathering) of Composition B residues should be considered when calculating mass transfer rates for fate and transport modeling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84861203181"

Four of the most common explosive tracer ions, nitrate, perchlorate, chlorate, and azide, and the most common background ions, chloride, sulfate, thiocyanate, fluoride, phosphate, and carbonate, were chosen for investigation. Using a separation electrolyte comprising 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 50 mM cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, pH 8.9 and 0.05% poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) in a hexadimethrine bromide (HDMB)-coated capillary it was possible to partially separate all 10 ions within 90 s. The combination of two cationic polymer additives (PEI and HDMB) was necessary to achieve adequate selectivity with a sufficiently stable electroosmotic flow (EOF), which was not possible with only one polymer. Careful optimization of variables affecting the speed of separation and injection timing allowed a further reduction of separation time to 55 s while maintaining adequate efficiency and resolution. Software control makes high sample throughput possible (60 samples/h), with very high repeatability of migration times [0.63-2.07% relative standard deviation (RSD) for 240 injections]. The separation speed does not compromise sensitivity, with limits of detection ranging from 23 to 50 μg•L-1 for all the explosive residues considered, which is 10× lower than those achieved by indirect absorbance detection and 2× lower than those achieved by C 4D using portable benchtop instrumentation. The combination of automation, high sample throughput, high confidence of peak identification, and low limits of detection makes this methodology ideal for the rapid identification of inorganic IED residues. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-82555185574"

This study analyzes the sensitivity of detonation characteristic lengths to the inter-component heat-transfer hypothesis required to obtain a closed set of governing equations. The slowest and the fastest transfers - isentropic reactants and thermal equilibrium, resp. - are investigated. Earlier studies were restricted to the thermodynamic phase plane and have found a weak effect of the transfer hypothesis on state variables. On the contrary, this analysis considers the chemical kinetic process. A state-sensitive Arrhenius reaction rate and two sets of constitutive parameters are used to generate three types of reaction profiles suited to most one-step energy releases in liquid explosives - specifically, long, balanced or short induction, relative to reaction. The chemical lengths and critical diameters of one- or two-dimensional detonations thus prove to be very sensitive to the transfer hypothesis - specifically much larger with the fastest - as well as to small variations of constitutive parameters. Importantly, the profile type is independent of transfer but not of parameters. Therefore, a pertinent response to a transfer change is to recalibrate the rate time-factor so as to keep constant some reference length, according to the profile type. For inductive or balanced profiles, any length can be used such as the CJ reaction length or the critical diameter. Asymptotic profiles require special attention because their length ratios depend on transfer. Constitutive parameters cannot be used with a transfer hypothesis different from that they were calibrated with. Too large experimental errors or numerically under-resolved calibrations may lead to skewed reaction profiles, and hence erroneous simulations of detonation dynamics. Thus, more accurate constitutive relations and information on steady reaction profiles in detonating liquid explosives are necessary. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-84876458078"

We report the first application of NEMD based on the Ikeshoji and Hafskjold (NEMD-IH) scheme to study the thermal conductivity of crystalline hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX), an important energetic material, at temperatures T = 230, 275, and 300 K for different sample sizes and different crystallographic directions. We found that the size effects arising from a finite distance between sources of heat in the NEMD-IH simulation show a well-defined linear dependence on the inverse of the sample length within the errors of simulation. The thermal conductivity exhibits anisotropy with the largest value found along the [0 0 1] crystallographic direction and the smallest value along the [0 1 0] direction. The extrapolated value of the directionally averaged thermal conductivity coefficient κ̄ to the sample of infinite length (e.g. 0.355W/Km atT=300K) is higher, but still in reasonable agreement with existing experimental data for powdered samples. The NEMD-IH heat transport properties were reproduced in a broad range of values of heat flux and sizes of heat source regions. Surprisingly, the thermal conductivity coefficient at T = 275 K is found to be higher by about 13% than at T = 300 K and 230 K, which may suggest a location of the temperature maximum above 230 K.

Briefly, light (200-500 nm) is shone on a surface such as a piece of luggage at an airport. Upon reflection, the light is collected with a spectrometer combined with a CCD camera. A computer processes the data and produces in turn a differential reflection spectrum involving two adjacent areas of the surface.

In-situ surface analysis of targeted compounds, including nitrogen-, halogen- and sulfur-salts, down to sub-nanogram levels, was performed using DESI-MS. Successful experiments were carried out in both the negative and the positive ion modes; simple anions and cations as well as small cluster ions were observed. Various surfaces are examined and surface porosity effects were briefly explored. Absolute detection limits on porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) of 120 pg (surface concentration 0.07 ng mm-2) and 50 pg (surface concentration 0.03 ng mm-2), were achieved for sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, respectively. The compounds of interest were examined in the presence of a hydrocarbon mixture to assess matrix effects: only a two- or three-fold decrease in the target ion intensity was observed.

They are engineered to provide reliable performance and maximum safety envelopes through reduction of their sensitivity. There are three kinds of polymer-bonded explosive materials; namely, PBX1, PBX2, and PBX3. The last two polymer-bonded explosives were recently invented, in search of the more insensitive polymer-bonded explosive but with high detonation energy also. To investigate the dynamic response of new materials, the uniaxial compressive stress-strain behavior of the three polymer-bonded explosives was investigated as a function of temperature and strain rate. Constant and non-constant strain rate loading experiments were conducted in the use of pulse shapers. By comparing two different loads, the strain rate effect of these materials was found to depend on the instantaneous strain rate. The variations in failure stress, and failure strain with temperature, strain rate, and material composition were examined. The dependence of compressive strength on temperature and strain rate can be attributed to the Young's modulus and fracture surface energy according to Griffith criteria for fracture. The axial splitting caused by brittle fracture for most conditions was also investigated. Another failure mode of PBX2 agreed with the Mohr's failure mode criterion.

The explosives examined are RDX, TNT, and HMX, which have been heated for two weeks at 75 degrees centigrade or irradiated for two weeks with a 15-Watt ultraviolet lamp (254nm). The optical signatures are obtained by illuminating the samples with a sequence of laser wavelengths between 420nm and 620nm in 10 nm steps and measuring the spectra of light scattered from the sample at each laser wavelength. The measurements are performed on the Naval Research Laboratory's SWOrRD instrument. SWOrRD is capable of illuminating a sample with laser wavelength between 210nm and 2000nm, in steps of 0.1nm, and measuring the spectrum of light scattered from the sample at each wavelength. SWOrRD's broad tuning range, high average power (1-300mW), narrow line width (< 4cm-1), and rapid wavelength tunability enable these measurements. Results, based on more than 80 measurements - each at 21 sequential laser wavelengths, indicate that the variation in spectral line amplitude observed when altering laser illumination wavelength differs between fresh and aged explosives.

Spectra collected from the aluminized charges exhibited Al and AlO emissions during the first ∼60 μs, followed by a broadband emission that evolved over two time scales: one in the early time, 0-200 μsec, and another on late time, 0.5-10 ms. The apparent temperatures of the early-time fireballs were obtained using barium atom thermometry and were found to be ∼2900 K for the RDX-only charges, ∼3600 K for the RDX-micron Al charges, and ∼4000 K for the RDX-nano Al charges. In both types of aluminized samples, once Al and AlO emissions ceased, the fireballs began to cool and approached the temperature obtained for the non-aluminized RDX charges. For aluminized charges, a late-time luminescence was also observed, with the intensity and duration dependent upon the size of the Al particles. Aluminum nanoparticles yielded a higher early-time temperature, but a less intense and shorter duration late-time emission, while micron-sized particles produced a lower early-time temperature, but a longer-lived and more intense late-time energy release.

Furthermore, many analytes of interest, such as explosives, are not available as permeation tubes. A method for easily and effectively establishing calibration curves for explosive vapor samples via direct deposition of standard solutions on thermal desorption tubes was investigated. The various components of the thermal desorption system were compared to a standard split/splitless inlet. Calibration curves using the direct liquid deposition method with a thermal desorption unit coupled to a cryo-focusing inlet were compared to a standard split/splitless inlet, and a statistical difference was observed but does not eliminate or deter the use of the direct liquid deposition method for obtaining quantitative results for explosive vapors. © 2012.","2-s2.0-84856609051"

Furthermore, if electron-acceptor units had structures similar to the diphenylquinoxaline in the PPE-derivatives chain, the polymers would give a better fluorescence quenching in response to TNT compound. Polymers PPE-7 and PPE-8 were chosen as representative samples to investigate their photo-oxidative stability compared with that of PPVs or PTs.

Using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), an unusual bias dependence in the detection sensitivity of 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene (TNT) on the reduced electric field (E/N) has been observed. For protonated TNT, rather than decreasing signal intensity with increasing E/N, which is the more usual sensitivity pattern observed in PTR-MS studies, an anomalous behavior is first observed, whereby the signal intensity initially rises with increasing E/N. We relate this to unexpected ion-molecule chemistry based upon comparisons of measurements taken with related nitroaromatic compounds (1,3,5 trinitrobenzene, 1,3 dinitrobenzene, and 2,4 dinitrotoluene) and electronic structure calculations. This dependence provides an easily measurable signature that can be used to provide a rapid highly selective analytical procedure to minimize false positives for the detection of TNT. This has major implications for Homeland Security and, in addition, has the potential of making instrumentation cost-effective for use in security areas.

An efficient ultrasonic probe has been used to radiate directly the samples producing very fine emulsions from immiscible liquids. A D-optimal design was used for optimizing the factors and to evaluate their influential upon extraction. The optimum experimental conditions were: sample volume, 10 mL; extraction time, 60 s; cycles, 0.6 s(s-1); power of ultrasound energy, 40% (70 W); and, extractant solvent (chlorobenzene) volume, 20 μL. Under the optimized experimental conditions the method presents good level of repeatability with coefficients of variation under 6% (n = 8; spiking level 10 μg L-1). Calculated calibration curves gave high level of linearity with correlation coefficient values between 0.9949 and 0.9992. Limits of detection were ranged between 0.03 and 0.91 μg L-1. Finally, the proposed method was applied to the analysis of two types of water samples, reservoir and effluent wastewater. The samples were previously analysed and confirmed free of target analytes. At 5 μg L-1 spiking level recovery values ranged between 75 and 96% for reservoir water sample showing that the matrix had a negligible effect upon extraction. However, a noticeable matrix effect (around 50% recovery) was observed for effluent wastewater sample. In order to alleviate this matrix effect, the standard addition calibration method was used for quantitative determination. This calibration method supplied recovery values ranged between 71 and 79%.

However, no sensitive analytical methods, such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), have been developed for detecting these new compounds at trace levels and to be concurrently applied to monitor the common explosives.

In this work, we optimized geometries and calculated the electron density of 17 nitroaromatic molecules using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. From the DFT one-electron density matrix, we computed the molecular charge densities, thus the electron densities, which were then decomposed into electric multipoles located at the atomic sites of the molecules using the distributed multipole analysis (DMA). The multipoles, which have a direct chemical interpretation, were then used to analyze in details the ground state charge structure of the molecules and to seek for correlations between charge properties and sensitivity of the corresponding energetic material. The DMA multipole moments do not present large variations when the size of the Gaussian basis set is changed; the largest variations occurred in the range 10-15% for the dipole and quadrupole moments of oxygen atoms. The charges on the carbon atoms of the aromatic ring of each molecule become more positive when the number of nitro groups increases and saturate when there are five and six nitro groups. The magnitude and the direction of the dipole moments of the carbon atoms, indicators of site polarization, also depend on the nature of adjacent groups, with the largest dipole value being for C-H bonds. The total magnitude of the quadrupole moment of the aromatic ring carbon atoms indicates a decrease in the delocalized electron density due to an electron-withdrawing effect. Three models for sensitivity of the materials based on the DMA multipoles were proposed. Explosives with large delocalized electron densities in the aromatic ring of the component molecule, expressed by large quadrupole values on the ring carbon atoms, correspond to more insensitive materials. Furthermore, the charges on the nitro groups also influence the impact sensitivity. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-80051768959"

Surface functionalization of silica with the fluorescent sensing polymer allows for more efficient quenching by the analyte, due to the small amount of fluorophore present, thus yielding enhanced detection sensitivity. The attachment of the sensing polymers onto a chromatographic support also allows for simultaneous separation of an explosive mixture, and component identification through the use of multiple sensing polymers. In a 1.0 mm 2 area solution spotted onto the fluorescent silica plate, detection limits obtained for the explosives TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), DNT (2,6-dinitrotoluene), PA (picric acid), Tetryl (N-methyl-N,2,4,6- tetranitroaniline), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane), and Cl-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2, 4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane) ranged from 4 to 750 pg mm -2.

We begin by reviewing the issue of explosives trace detection (ETD) and describe the method of mass spectrometry (MS) as an alternative to existing technologies. Effective security screening devices must be accurate (high detection and low false positive rate), fast and cost effective (upfront and operating costs). Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is the most commonly deployed method for ETD devices. Its advantages are compact size and relatively low price. For applications requiring a handheld detector, IMS is an excellent choice. For applications that are more stationary (e.g., checkpoint and alternatives to IMS are available. MS is recognized for its superior performance with regard to sensitivity and specificity, which translate to lower false negative and false positive rates. In almost all applications outside of security where accurate chemical analysis is needed, MS is usually the method of choice and is often referred to as the gold standard for chemical analysis. There are many review articles and proceedings that describe detection technologies for explo-sives.1,2,3,4 Here we compare MS and IMS and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method. • Mass spectrometry (MS): MS offers high levels of sensitivity and specificity compared to other technologies for chemical detection. Its traditional disadvantages have been high cost and complexity. Over the last few years, however, the economics have greatly improved and MS is now capable of routine and automated operation. • Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS):5 IMS is similar in concept to MS except that the ions are dispersed by gas-phase viscosity and not by molecular weight. The main advantage of IMS is that it does not use a vacuum system, which greatly reduces the size, cost, and complexity relative to MS. However, the trade-off is that the measurement accuracy is considerably less than MS. This is especially true for complex samples or when screening for a large number of target compounds simultaneously. © 2011 SPIE.","2-s2.0-79960396229"

The present work also demonstrates that large temperature and pressure increases could occur because of the existence of TEA and aluminum hydroxide.

The use of dilute H 2O 2 to clean chemical vessels is common, but it has been shown to be potentially hazardous due to the reaction of H 2O 2 with organic solvents to form explosive peroxides. Mixing concentrated H 2O 2 and acetone with an acid catalyst is known to form the shock and friction sensitive explosives triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP). A search of the chemical literature was unable to identify any directly applicable research or technical information that addressed the potential formation of explosive peroxides when mixing dilute H 2O 2 and acetone solutions. The conclusion of these experiments is that when mixing dilute solutions, such as less than 3% H 2O 2 and 7% acetone, the solutions are unlikely to form significant amounts of TATP or DADP. In the presence of an acid catalyst, hundreds of parts per million of organic peroxides can be formed. Although TATP is relatively insoluble in water, it is soluble at roughly the 15ppm level and higher for acetone and H 2O 2 solutions, thus any acetone peroxides that are formed without acid catalyst should remain soluble in the aqueous cleaning solution. © 2011 Division of Chemical Health and Safety of the American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84862807935"

It is located and mounted outside the standard GC oven on its available top detector port, while the capillary column is connected as usual to the standard GC injector and supersonic molecular beam interface transfer line.

The method has been applied to explosives tagging. The method is based on the addition to the explosive of two enriched isotopes of the same element, which may be already present within it, at a given molar ratio. This dual-isotope approach will give a unique fingerprint to the tagged explosive. Further, the authentication of the tagged explosive or its residues will be obtained by comparison of the ratio of molar fractions experimentally measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with the molar fraction ratio of the tagging mixture. The novelty of this tagging method relies on working with isotope abundances and molar fraction ratios instead of the classical isotope ratios, and this fact constitutes the strong point of the described approach since the molar ratio is not affected by physical, chemical, or biochemical processes, and it is also not disturbed by environmental contamination with the natural abundance element. Furthermore, the use of molar fraction ratios overcomes the nonhomogeneous distribution of the tagging element within the explosive. As the tagging element can be present at trace or ultratrace levels, a very small amount of enriched isotopes needs to be added, denoting a low cost solution. Also, the use of enriched stable isotopes of nontoxic elements will have negligible health effects or affect the environment. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84855368619"

RDX is one of the most frequently utilized nitramine explosives for mining, demolition and munitions purposes in the United States (US). The degradation of RDX in natural environments is of particular importance as a result of the accumulation of consequential degradation products in nature. Specifically, RDX has the potential to be degraded by microorganisms resulting in hazardous levels of harmful degradation products in soil and groundwater. The necessity for the detection of these particular degradation products is emphasized as a consequence of their toxicity as these products are recognized as potential mutagens. Photo-assisted electrochemical detection (PAED) following HPLC-UV is used to develop an analytical method qualified for the assessment of RDX and degradation products. The technique offers unique selectivity possessed by the photochemical reactor coupled to EC detection serving to eliminate the need for repetitive analysis using different column technologies. Furthermore, on-line sample pretreatment is developed and optimized specifically for the preparation of samples consisting of RDX and degradation products. Analytical figures of merit determined for all target analytes using on-line SPE-HPLC-UV-PAED revealed detection limits in the sub part per billion range for RDX and degradation product MEDINA.

Anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) with large surface area through its porous structure and light background color was utilized as the substrate for colorimetric sensors. Fabricated thin AAO films with thickness less than ∼500 nm allowed us to observe interference colors which were used as the background color for colorimetric detection. AAO thin films with various thickness and pore-to-pore distance were prepared through anodizing aluminum foils at different voltages and times in dilute sulfuric acid. Various interference colors were observed on these samples due to their difference in structures. Accordingly, suitable anodization conditions that produce AAO samples with desired light background colors for optical applications were obtained. Thin film interference model was applied to analyze the UV-vis reflectance spectra and to estimate the thickness of the AAO membranes. We found that the thickness of produced AAO films increased linearly with anodization time in sulfuric acid. In addition, the growth rate was higher for AAO anodized using higher voltages. The thin film interference formulism was further validated with a well established layer by layer deposition technique. Coating poly(styrene sulfonate) sodium salt (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) layer by layer on AAO thin film consistently shifted its surface color toward red due to the increase in thickness. The red shift of UV-vis reflectance was correlated quantitatively to the number of layers been assembled. This sensitive red shift due to molecular attachment (increase in thickness) on AAO substrate was applied toward nitroaromatics detection. Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTS) which can be attached onto AAO nanowells covalently through silanization and attract TNT molecules was coated and applied for TNT detection. UV-vis spectra of AAO with APTS shifted to the longer wavelength side due to TNT attachment. This red shift implied AAO thickness increased and positive detection of TNT molecules. It was also observed that both APTS and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were electron rich polymers which formed Meisenheimer complexes with TNT in solution and changed its color abruptly. This strong color change due to chemical reaction was applied as another approach for direct TNT detection. Commercial AAO films with long pores (60 μm) and white background color were coated with APTS or PEI and then exposed to TNT in solution. These membranes turned to pink rapidly and eventually became visibly orange after a few hours with a strong absorption around 500 nm that was consistent with the formation of Meisenheimer complexes. The visible color change can be observed by unaided eyes and is suitable for nitroaromatics detection at higher concentration while interference color red shift in AAO thin film is designed for nitroaromatics detection at monolayer (nm) level. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These simulations were performed at room temperature (300 K) and low pressures (up to 1 ppm RDX). The atomic charges required for MD and GCMC simulations were calculated from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations using two different charge generation methods - Löwdin Population Analysis and Natural Bond Orbital Analysis. Both charge sets show that the presence of amine groups increases the amount of RDX adsorbed. The cage size and the location of amine groups also affect the loading of RDX. The amount of RDX adsorbed is correlated with the energy of adsorption. The activation energy for diffusion of RDX is not positively correlated with the energy of adsorption. The density distributions identify the location of the adsorption sites of RDX-exclusively in the big cage around the metal complex vertices and between benzene rings.

In the IRMOFs functionalized with amine groups, a second nitro group of the RDX interacts with an amine group, enhancing adsorption.

From a simple Langmuir estimation, the selectivity of RDX over butane is up to 5000. The diffusion of RDX is sufficiently high for real time sensor applications. These results indicate IRMOFs can be tailored with functional groups to be highly selective nanoporous preconcentrators. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77955308430"

Metastable helium atoms (He*) were used as the primary ionizing agents and were generated from a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) source. A gaseous sample of ambient air was drawn into an enclosed ionization chamber and subsequently mixed with metastable species at sub-atmospheric pressure. O2- ions produced from the ionization of ambient air readily react with H2O2 to form the stable [H2O2 + O2]- cluster ion. A detection limit of 0.8 ppbv was achieved by coupling the ion source to a commercial time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The construction of the ion source is simple, and vapors from bulky objects can also be analyzed directly by placing the sample close to the sampling nozzle.

The general trend towards miniaturized separation systems was also followed for mid-IR detection where two key developments are of special importance. Firstly, concerning on-line detection the advent of micro-fabricated flow-cells with inner volumes of only a few nL for transmission as well as attenuated total reflection measurements enabled on-line mid-IR detection in capillary LC and opened the path for the first successful realization of on-line mid-IR detection in capillary zone electrophoresis as well as micellar electrokinetic chromatography. Secondly, concerning off-line detection the use of micro-flow through dispensers now enables to concentrate eluting analytes on dried spots sized a few tens of micrometers, thus matching the dimensions for sensitive detection by mid-IR microscopy. Finally in an attempt to increase detection sensitivity of on-line mid-IR detection, mid-IR quantum cascade lasers have been used. Applications cover the field of food analysis, environmental analysis and the characterization of explosives among others.

The net effect of this energy transport on the detonation is unclear. It could enhance the detonation by precompressing the explosive near the wall. Alternatively, it could decrease the explosive performance by crushing porosity required for initiation by shock compression or destroying confinement ahead of the detonation. At present, these phenomena are not well understood. But with slowly detonating, non-ideal high explosive (NIHE) systems becoming increasing prevalent, proper understanding and prediction of the performance of these metal-confined NIHE systems is desirable. Experiments are discussed that measured the effect of ANFO detonation energy transported upstream of the front by a 76-mm-inner-diameter aluminum confining tube. Detonation velocity, detonation front-shape, and aluminum response are recorded as a function of confiner wall thickness and length. Detonation shape profiles display little curvature near the confining surface, which is attributed to energy transported upstream modifying the flow. Average detonation velocities were seen to increase with increasing confiner thickness, while wavefront curvature decreased due to the stiffer, subsonic confinement. Significant radial sidewall tube motion was observed immediately ahead of the detonation. Axial motion was also detected, which interfered with the front-shape measurements in some cases. It was concluded that the confiner was able to transport energy ahead of the detonation and that this transport has a definite effect on the detonation by modifying its characteristic shape. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.

Two differently sized CdTe QDs emitting red and green fluorescences, respectively, have been hybridized by embedding the red-emitting one in silica nanoparticles and covalently linking the green-emitting one to the silica surface, respectively, to form a dual-emissive fluorescent hybrid nanoparticle. The fluorescence of red QDs in the silica nanoparticles stays constant, whereas the green QDs functionalized with polyamine can selectively bind TNT by the formation of Meisenheimer complex, leading to the green fluorescence quenching due to resonance energy transfer.

A basic hydrolysis of nitrocellulose with 1.0% (m/v) NaOH at 150. °C during 30. min was carried out for nitrocellulose from gunpowders (after its previous isolation by a protocol optimized by our research group) and from collodion samples. The concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions in the hydrolysate was determined by ion chromatography with suppression and conductimetric detection. The nitrogen content of nitrocellulose was calculated from the values of the concentration of both ions. The quantitative method was evaluated in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, robustness, limits of detection and quantification, and precision, measured as repeatability and intermediate precision. These parameters were good enough to demonstrate the validity of the method and its applicability to the determination of the nitrogen content of nitrocellulose contained in different types of gunpowders (single- and double-base gunpowders, manufactured from 1944 to 1997) and in commercial collodion samples. For gunpowders, the nitrogen content determined with the optimized method was compared with the values reported by the official label of the ammunition (obtained by a digestion/titration method) and errors, by defect, ranging from 1% to 15.2% (m/m) were calculated. The highest errors were obtained for the oldest gunpowders and could be attributed to the loss of nitro groups in the nitrocellulose molecule during aging. For collodion samples, errors could not be calculated since the real nitrogen content for these samples was not given in the label. In addition, the analysis time (2. h for nitrocellulose isolation, 1.5. h for nitrocellulose hydrolysis, and 0.2. h for chromatographic separation) was about 10 times lower than in the digestion/titration method nowadays used for gunpowder samples. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-78650176779"

Analytical models are developed in order to explain the dependency of the combustion times on the particle diameter. Experimental evidence shows that there exists, for carbonaceous and metallic materials, mainly two combustion regimes that are either kinetically controlled, for small size particles, or diffusion controlled, for large size particles. From the experimentally measured combustion data of those materials, the dependencies of the ignition temperature and the minimal explosive concentration (MEC) with regard to the particle size have been analyzed. We found that the two combustion regimes yield two different tendencies with respect to the particle size. Overall, it is found that as the particle size decreases, minimum ignition temperature (MIT) and minimum ignition energy (MIE) decrease, indicating higher potential inflammation and explosion risks for the use of nanopowders. By contrast, the minimal explosion concentration (MEC) did not show strong variations as the particle size decreases. Rather, a theoretical plateau is observed, which was experimentally confirmed.

Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) represents a powerful non-invasive tool providing information on the atomic structure of samples. In this paper, EDXRD is investigated as a suitable technique for explosive detection and identification. To this end, a database has been constructed, containing measured X-ray diffraction spectra of several explosives and common materials. In order to quantify spectral resolution influence, this procedure is repeated with two different detectors which have different spectral resolution. Using our database, some standard spectrum analysis procedures generally used for this application have been implemented. Regarding to the results, it is possible to conclude on the robustness and the limits of each analysis procedure. The aim of this work is to define a robust and efficient sequence of EDXRD spectra analysis to discriminate explosive substances. Since our explosive substances are crystalline, the first step consists in using characteristic of the spectrum to estimate a crystallinity criterion which allows to remove a large part of common materials.

Numerous studies of the temporal fate of explosive compounds in soils, surface water and laboratory batch reactors have been conducted. However, most of these investigations relied on the application of explosive compounds to the media via aqueous addition and thus these studies do not provide information on the real world loading of explosive residues during detonation events. To address this we investigated the dissolution and sorption of TNT and RDX from Comp B residues loaded to pure mineral phases through controlled detonation. Mineral phases included nontronite, vermiculite, biotite and Ottawa sand (quartz with minor calcite). High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the dissolution and sorption of TNT and RDX residues loaded onto the mineral surfaces. Detonation resulted in heterogeneous loading of TNT and RDX onto the mineral surfaces. Explosive compound residues dissolved rapidly (within 9. h) in all samples but maximum concentrations for TNT and RDX were not consistent over time due to precipitation from solution, sorption onto mineral surfaces, and/or chemical reactions between explosive compounds and mineral surfaces.

All calculations, including optimizations, charge analysis and 15NNitro NMR chemical shifts, were performed using density functional (DFT) methods with 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. The results show a linear correlation between the nitro group charges and C/N-nitro bond lengths. The latter reflect the strength of the corresponding bond and thus the stability of the nitro compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the heat of detonation with the charge and 15N NMR chemical shift on the nitro group in nitramines and nitro paraffins. Nitro compounds with a higher heat of detonation have less negative nitro group charges, (QNitro) and a lower value for the 15NNitro chemical shift in analogous compounds. From the quantitative models, the heat of detonation increase when the QNitro values (positive coefficient) are larger and decrease when the 15NNitro NMR chemical shift (negative coefficient) is higher. The present work provides consistent models (mean square error prediction values below 0.14MJkg-1) in a systematic way for quick estimation of heats of detonation - with or without experimental data - for a wide range of energetic materials.

An exothermic peak at around 280 °C in DTA curve of xerogel associated with weight loss due to TNT decomposition as indicated in TGA curve confirmed the presence of TNT in the xerogel. Infrared spectrum of the xerogel showed peaks at 1550 and 1350 cm-1 assigned to C-NO2 bond in TNT and peaks at 1100 and 450 cm-1 associated with Si-O bonding in silica. Small angle X-ray scattering measurements revealed that TNT entered the pores of the silica matrix resulting in reduction of average pore size of the gel matrix. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated an average particle size of 280 to 443 nm for silica clusters. XRD analysis showed the crystalline nature of TNT with an average crystallite grain size of around 41 nm. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that nanocrystalline TNT particles with sizes ranging from 5 nm to 45 nm were dispersed in silica matrix. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77957160267"

This work presents the first comprehensive study of the detection of volatile and semi-volatile additives of smokeless powders using solid phase microextraction (SPME) as a sampling and pre-concentration technique. The goal of this study is to generate a list of compounds that can be used as target compounds for the vapor phase detection of smokeless powders. Sixty-five smokeless powders were studied using laboratory-based gas chromatography techniques and a field deployable ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). The detection of diphenylamine, ethyl and methyl centralite, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, diethyl and dibutyl phthalate by IMS is suggested as a method to indicate the presence of smokeless powders. A previously reported SPME-IMS analytical approach facilitates rapid sub-nanogram detection of the vapor phase components of smokeless powders. The analyte mass present in the vapor phase was sufficient for a SPME fiber to extract and concentrate most analytes at amounts above the detection limits of both the GC and the IMS methods. Analysis of 65 different smokeless powder samples revealed that diphenylamine was present in the headspace of 96% of the powders studied. Ethyl centralite was detected in 47% of the powders and 8% of the powders contained methyl centralite. Nitroglycerin was the dominant peak present in the headspace of the double-based powders. Another important headspace component, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, was detected in 44% of the powders comprising both double and single-based powders. Static headspace SPME of small amounts (∼100 mg) of smokeless powder samples for ∼5 min at room temperature resulted in the successful detection of the headspace components, demonstrating the applicability of the technique for field detection of smokeless powders using IMS as a detector. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-79955478141"

The non-isothermal simultaneous TG-differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the thermal decomposition of KIO3 was carried out in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates. The isothermal decomposition of KIO3 was studied using TG at different temperatures in the range 790-805 K in nitrogen atmosphere. The theoretical and experimental mass loss data are in good agreement for the thermal decomposition of KIO3. The non-isothermal decomposition of KIO3 was subjected to kinetic analyses by model-free approach, which is based on the isoconversional principle. The isothermal decomposition of KIO3 was subjected to both conventional (model fitting) and model-free (isoconversional) methods. It has been observed that the activation energy values obtained from all these methods agree well.

Treatment of these compounds with acidic solutions produced peroxides, which were transformed into radical derivatives by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and then quantified by measuring the light emitted during their oxidation of luminol. The method was first developed in the microplate format and later optimized for a portable luminometer, to enable rapid application of the assay directly on site. When the portable luminometer was used each analysis took only 5-10 min. The method had good selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility; in the microplate format the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 40 and 50 ng mL -1, respectively, for both TATP and HMTD. When the portable luminometer was used the LOD and LOQ were 50 and 100 ng mL-1, respectively, for both compounds.

Under ambient conditions, the gas flow and atmospheric pressure significantly affect the transfer and focusing of ions. The design and implementation of air flow assisted ionization (AFAI) as a novel and effective, remote sampling method for ambient mass spectrometry are described herein. AFAI benefits from a high extracting air flow rate. A systematic investigation of the extracting air flow in the AFAI system has been carried out, and it has been demonstrated not only that it plays a role in the effective capture and remote transport of charged droplets, but also that it promotes desolvation and ion formation, and even prevents ion fragmentation during the ionization process. Moreover, the sensitivity of remote sampling ambient MS analysis was improved significantly by the AFAI method. Highly polar and nonpolar molecules, including dyes, pharmaceutical samples, explosives, drugs of abuse, protein and volatile compounds, have been successfully analyzed using AFAI-MS. The successful application of the technique to residue detection on fingers, large object analysis and remote monitoring in real time indicates its potential for the analysis of a variety of samples, especially large objects. The ability to couple this technique with most commercially available MS instruments with an API interface further enhances its broad applicability.

For the last twenty years, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has become a valuable alternative to ion chromatography (IC) for the analysis of inorganic-based explosives because of its low running costs and its simplicity of use. This article focuses on the development and validation of a CE method for the simultaneous analysis of 10 anions (chloride, nitrite, nitrate, thiosulphate, perchlorate, chlorate, thiocyanate, carbonate, sulphate, and phosphate) which can be found in post-blast residues, plus for the first time azide anion, possibly present in the composition of detonators, and the internal standard (formate) in 20 min total runtime. Intermediate precisions were 2.11% for normalized areas and 0.72% for normalized migration times. Limits of detection close to 0.5 ppm for all anions were obtained with the use of preconcentration techniques, thanks to a fast and simple sample preparation allowing the analysis of a large variety of matrices with the developed generic CE method. The matrix effects were statistically studied for the first time in the explosive field for different matrices, containing interfering anions and cations, sometimes at high levels. In fact, no significant matrix effect occurred (tests with blank matrix extracts of soil, cloth, glass, plastic, paper, cotton, and metal). Finally, analyses of real post-blast residues and real detonator extracts were performed.

The carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of UN and its component ions, urea and nitrate, could aid in a forensic investigation. A method was developed to separate UN into its component ions for δ15N measurements by dissolving the sample with KOH, drying the sample, followed by removal of the urea by dissolution into 100% methanol. UN was synthesized to assess for preservation of the carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of reactants (urea and nitric acid) and product UN. Based on nitrogen isotope mass balance, all UN samples contained varying amounts of excess nitric acid, making the ionic separation an essential step in the nitrogen isotope analysis. During UN synthesis experiments, isotopic composition of the reactants is preserved in the product UN, but the urea in the product UN is slightly enriched in 15N (<1‰) relative to the reactant urea. Published isotopic compositions of UN reactants, urea and nitric acid, have large ranges (urea δ15N=-10.8 to +3.3‰; urea δ13C=-18.2 to -50.6‰; and nitric acid δ15N=-1.8 to +4.0‰). The preservation of isotopic composition of reactants in UN, along with a significant variability in isotopic composition of reactants, indicates that isotope ratio analysis may be used to test if urea or nitric acid collected during an investigation is a possible reactant for a specific UN sample. The carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios differ significantly between two field-collected UN samples, as well as the lab-synthesized UN samples.

Some of these are also explosives. Seeking a correlation with detonability of large quantities of energetic materials, four laboratory tests were used. The characteristics considered indicative of detonability were ability to fragment a metal casing, when initiated by a detonator, and ability to produce large quantities of gas and heat. The best developed of these tests is differential scanning calorimetry. It has already been pioneered by other researchers. A limitation of this study is that large-scale detonability remains unknown for a number of materials examined; thus, it is difficult to sufficiently evaluate the success of the small-scale analyses. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-78049485449"

Collected reflections were integrated using the latest version of the program VIIPP which uses separate Kα1/Kα 2 contributions to the profile fitting during integration. For each temperature both anharmonic and harmonic descriptions of the atomic thermal motion were utilized in the model refinements along with the multipole expansion of the electron density. H atoms were refined anisotropically and agree well with a previous neutron study. Topological analysis [Bader (1990). Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. The International Series of Monographs of Chemistry, edited by J. Halpern & M. L. H. Green. Oxford: Clarendon Press] of the attained electron density followed. For 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7- tetraazacyclooctane (HMX), old data collected at 20 and 120 K were re-integrated with the new version of VIIPP and refined in the same manner as for RDX. In both cases theoretical structure factors were also calculated based on the 20 K structures, and employed in comparison multipole refinements for the atoms at rest. Limiting the refinement to a harmonic model of the atomic displacements may result in a biased and erroneous electron density, especially when atomic vibrations are significant (as in RDX) and at temperatures higher than obtained by using liquid helium. Given the similarity of the two compounds the effects of anharmonic motion are strikingly more severe in the case of RDX. Our study reinforces the conclusion of Meindl et al. [Acta Cryst. (2010), A66, 362-371] that in certain cases it is necessary to include anharmonic term(s) of the probability density function (or temperature factor) in order to obtain a meaningful electron density suitable for topological analysis, even for compact (high-density) light-atom structures. For RDX it was observed that the oxygen lone-pair concentrations of electrons are located close to perpendicular to the N - O bond vectors, which is typical for explosive materials. Conjugation of the electron density in the - N - NO2 fragment has been established based on the topological bond orders. Nine moderately strong hydrogen bonds and nine N - N, O - N and O - O bonding interactions were found and described.

A fast, simple, selective, and cost-effective method allowing the simultaneous detection of chloride and nitrate anions and aluminum(III) was thus required. This article focused on the development and validation of a CE method using a BGE containing 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (PDC) acting as both an anionic chromophore and as an aluminum(III) complexing agent. First, the achievement of the speciation diagram of Al(III) in the presence of PDC allowed the choice of pH conditions for which aluminum(III) was globally anionic. The study of the selectivity for Al(III) in the presence of ten other cationic species potentially present in post-blast residues dictated the choice of the PDC concentration at 20 mM. The validation step next demonstrated the figures of merit of the method, with an intermediate precision for Al(III) of 2% on normalized migration times and 3.5% on corrected areas.

As a whole, the homolysis of C{single bond}NF2 or C{single bond}NO2 bonds is the main step for bond dissociation of the title compounds. Detonation properties of seven title compounds were evaluated by using the Kamlet-Jacobs equation based on the calculated densities and HOFs. It is found that 3,3,7,7-tetrakis(difluoroamino)octahydro-1,5-dinitro-1,5-diazocine (HNFX) and 3,3,5,5-tetrakis (difluoroamino)-1-nitro piperidine (N-nitro TDFAPP), with predicted density of ca. 2.0 g/cm3, detonation velocity (D) about 9.9 km/s, and detonation pressure (P) of 47 GPa that are lager than those of HMX, are expected to be the novel candidates of high energy density materials (HEDMs). The detonation data of 1,3,3,5,7,7-hexanitro-1,5-diazacyclooctane (HNDZ) and TNBDFAPP show that they meet the requirements for HEDMs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-44649102026"

Generic accident sequences are developed using Event Trees. This analysis is adapted to plant-specific conditions and potentially additional protective measures are rank-ordered in terms of the induced reduction in the frequency of explosion, by including also uncertainty.

The precursor including carbon and Al5O6N was engendered firstly during the detonation of compound dynamite, and then the pure Al5O6N nanoparticles were obtained when the carbon was removed through calcining at high temperature. The precursor and the final as-synthesized Al5O6N powder were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), respectively. The calcining temperature schedule of the precursor was decided through DTA/TG analysis. The results indicate that the precursor consists of 37.7% carbon and 62.3 °C Al5O6N. After calcining at 600 °C for 1 h, the average diameter of the as-synthesized Al5O6N nanocrystal is 30-40 nm and the morphology micrograph takes on uniform spherical shape.

There has been a paradigm shift in the predictive capability of solid-propellant combustion models as the field has advanced from a simple and global-kinetics approach to a detailed approach that employs elementary reaction mechanisms in the gas phase, and accommodates thermal decomposition and subsequent reactions in the condensed phase. The detailed models not only allow calculation of propellant burning-rate characteristics, such as pressure and temperature sensitivities, but also of the surface conditions and entire combustion-wave structure, including the spatial variations in temperature and species concentrations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the modeling and simulation of various solid-propellant ingredients over a wide range of ambient conditions. The specific materials of concern include nitramines (RDX, HMX), azides (GAP), nitrate esters (NG, BTTN, TMETN), ADN, and AP monopropellants, as well as homogeneous mixtures representing binary (RDX/GAP, HMX/GAP, and AP/HTPB) and ternary (RDX/GAP/BTTN) pseudo-propellants. Emphasis is placed on the steady-state combustion and laser-induced ignition of nitramines. The capabilities and deficiencies of existing approaches are addressed. In general, the detailed gas-phase reaction mechanisms developed so far represent the chemistry of monopropellants and associated mixtures consistently well, and help understand the intricate processes of solid-propellant combustion. The reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, however, still pose an important challenge. Furthermore, the current knowledge of the initial decomposition of molecules emerging from the propellant surface is insufficient to render the models fully predictive. Modeling is thus not yet a predictive tool, but it is a useful guide. In the near future, it is likely that detailed combustion models can assist in the formulation of advanced solid propellants meeting various performance and emission requirements. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure of the Cr2O3 matrix was studied by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM); the Cr2O3/RDX nanocomposites were characterized by nitrogen adsorption. A mathematical model based on these techniques was used to demonstrate that the Cr2O 3 matrix encloses and stabilizes RDX particles at the nanoscale. The decomposition process of the nanocomposites was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The reactivity and sensitivity of the nanocomposites were studied by impact and friction tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), time-resolved cinematography and detonation experiments, and were correlated with their structure. The size of RDX nanoparticles and their distribution in the Cr2O3 matrix have an important influence on their reactivity. The reactive properties of nanostructured RDX differ significantly from those of classical micron-sized RDX. For instance, the melting point disappears and the decomposition temperature is significantly lowered.

Based on the choice of the initial nucleation sites density, the model predicts, simultaneously, the bubble growth processes in the liquid at the superheat-limit state, the front velocity of the expanding liquid, and the shock wave pressure formed by the liquid expansion through the air. Conditions of shock formation were found to be normally associated with high initial temperatures that can bring the liquid to its superheat-limit state during the initial depressurization. Furthermore, the high initial temperature also induces a generation of higher vapor pressures that forces a rapid mixture expansion. Model predictions of the shock wave strengths, in terms of TNT equivalence, were compared against those obtained by simple energy models. As expected, the simple energy models over predicts the shock wave strength.

The decomposition peak temperatures of cured GAP/NG/BTTN (1:1:1), cured GAP/NG/BTTN (1:0.5:0.5) and cured GAP/NG/BTTN (1:0.25:0.25) decrease by approximately 20 °C, 33 °C and 39 °C compared with cured GAP, respectively. This indicates that plasticizers NG/BTTN have good acceleration effects on the decomposition of cured GAP, especially for low content of NG/BTTN. At the same time, the results of DTA show that the decomposition heat of cured GAP/NG/BTTN is larger than that of cured GAP. In situ FTIR results show NG/BTTN not only accelerate the decomposition of -N3 groups and characteristic urethane links {A figure is presented}, but also accelerate the decomposition of C-O-C groups. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Results from batch experiments showed that 65% of TNT and 45% of RDX were transformed from solution in the presence of pyrite under pH 7.4 buffered conditions within 32 days. Without a buffered solution, transformation of TNT and RDX decreased. NG was continuously and rapidly transformed by pyrite under both conditions. Complete removal of NG was achieved in 32 days under buffered conditions. NH4+ was identified as a reduction product for RDX and NG in the pyrite-water system. Reductive transformation of RDX and NG by magnetite was slower than that by pyrite. The results suggest that abiotic transformation of the explosives by pyrite and magnetite may be considered when determining the fate of explosives in Fe/S-rich subsurface environments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An ignition and growth model and the Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equations of state were employed. The simple mixture rule assumes that the reacting explosive is a simple mixture of the reactant and product components. Four different assumptions, such as that of thermal equilibrium and isotropy, were adopted to calculate the pressure. The main purpose of this paper is to present the answer to the question of why the numerical results of shock-initiation are insensitive to the assumptions adopted. The equations of state for reactants and products were assessed by considering plots of the specific internal energy E and specific volume V. If the slopes of the constant-pressure lines for both components in the E-V plane are almost the same, it is demonstrated that the numerical results are insensitive to the assumptions adopted. We have found that the relation for the specific volumes of the two components can be approximately expressed by a single curve of the specific volume of the reactant vs that of the products.

Our main focus is on the study of the Βδ phase transformations (PTs) in crystalline HMX under a complex pressure-temperature path. To reproduce the pressure-temperature path, in particular during heating of PBX inside of a rigid cylinder, the Βδ PTs in HMX are coupled to chemical decomposition of the HMX and binder leading to gas formation, gas leaking from the cylinder, elastic, thermal, and transformational straining as well as straining due to mass loss. A fully physically based thermodynamic and kinetic model of the Βδ PT in HMX crystal is developed. It is based on a suggested nucleation mechanism via melt mediated nanocluster transformation and the recently revealed growth mechanism via internal stress-induced virtual melting. During the nucleation, nanosize clusters of the Β phase dissolve in a molten binder and transform diffusionally into δ phase clusters. During the interface propagation, internal stresses induced by transformation strain cause the melting of the stressed δ phase much below (120 K) the melting temperature and its immediate resolidification into the unstressed δ phase. These mechanisms explain numerous puzzles of HMX polymorphism and result in overall transformation kinetics that is in good agreement with experiments. Simple phenomenological equations for kinetics of chemical decomposition of the HMX and the binder are in good correspondence with experiments as well. A continuum deformation model is developed in two steps. The geometrically linear (small strain) theory is used to prove that the internal stresses and macroscopic shear stresses are negligible. Then a large strain theory is developed under hydrostatic loading. The developed continuum thermomechanochemical model is applied in the accompanying paper [V. I. Levitas, B. F. Henson, L. B.

The initial concentrations of nitroaromatics were in the range of 1.0 × 10-5 to 3.0 × 10-4 M. For the Fenton oxidation of the four nitroaromatics, the structural characteristic is the major factor affecting the decomposition rate rather than the interference effect coming from the oxidation intermediates. Oxidation rate of the explosives in the Fenton process were in the following sequence: DNT > PA > AP > TNT. The results were in good agreement with kinetic model, assuming the pseudo-steady-state hypothesis of hydroxyl radical formed by the Fenton reaction. Thus, a half-life prediction model was proposed and compared with the half-lives calculated from pseudo-first-order equation to prove the interference effect resulted from the oxidation intermediates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Descriptors were collected from literature and through empirical, semi-empirical and density functional theory-based calculations. Principal components were used to describe the distribution of the compounds in a multidimensional space. Four components described 76% of the variation in the dataset. PC1 separated the compounds due to molecular weight, PC2 separated the different isomers, PC3 arranged the compounds according to different functional groups such as nitrobenzoic acids, nitrobenzenes, nitrotoluenes and nitroesters and PC4 differentiated the compounds containing chlorine from other compounds. Quantitative structure-property relationship models were calculated using partial least squares (PLS) projection to latent structures to predict gas chromatographic (GC) retention times and the distribution between the water phase and air using solid-phase microextraction (SPME). GC retention time was found to be dependent on the presence of polar amine groups, electronic descriptors including highest occupied molecular orbital, dipole moments and the melting point. The model of GC retention time was good, but the precision was not precise enough for practical use. An important environmental parameter was measured using SPME, the distribution between headspace (air) and the water phase. This parameter was mainly dependent on Henry's law constant, vapour pressure, log P, content of hydroxyl groups and atmospheric OH rate constant.

Since we took as a reference the product obtained after CL-20 irradiation in methanol solution, the nature of intermolecular bonds between heterocycles under study and methanol molecules was analyzed in detail. Existing hydrogen bonds were found to be quite strong, so dependence of calculations results on an influence of solvent was taken into account using both the polarizable continuum model (PCM) and the supermolecular approach. Electronic spectra of 1,5-dihydrodiimidazo[4,5-b:4′5′e]pyrazine, 1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyrazine and 1H-imidazole were simulated using time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and single-excitation configuration interaction (CIS) method. We observed that TD-DFT excitation energies are lower if compared to corresponding values obtained by the CIS method. Results of calculations with PCM and the supermolecular approach are very close. It was found that differences between calculated gas phase excitation energies and those values obtained by applying solvent models increases when the number of conjugated bonds in a molecule increases. Oscillator strengths of UV bands of the considered molecules are higher in the gas phase than in modeled methanol solutions.

The parameters of the distributions of the probability of ignition are determined by the maximum likelihood method; normal, logistic, lognormal and Weibull distributions have been used. Confidence bands for the probability points are obtained both from the asymptotic standard errors of the parameters and by a bootstrap-like technique. The four distributions used give similar results in a rather ample probability range; discrepancies in the probability points are within 2% and in the confidence limits within 10% in a range of probability [0.1, 0.9] in most of the cases.

DAAF has received major attention as an insensitive high energy explosive; however, the mechanism and dynamics of the decomposition of this material are not clear yet. In order to understand the initial decomposition mechanism of DAAF and those of its model systems, nanosecond energy resolved and femtosecond time resolved spectroscopies and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations have been employed to investigate the excited electronic state decomposition of these materials. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from DAAF and its model systems at three UV excitation wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm) with a pulse duration of 8 ns. Energies of the three excitation wavelengths coincide with the (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) vibronic bands of the NO A +2 X 2 electronic transition, respectively. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for DAAF, which generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (20 K) and a vibrationally hot (1265 K) distribution. On the contrary, excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels are observed for the model systems, which generate the NO product with both rotationally cold and hot distributions depending on the excitation wavelengths. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF level of theory illustrates that two conical intersections between the excited and ground electronic states are involved in two different excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels for the model systems. Femtosecond pump-probe experiments at 226 nm reveal that the NO molecule is still the main observed decomposition product from the materials of interest and that the formation dynamics of the NO product is faster than 180 fs. Two additional fragments are observed from furazan with mass of 40 amu (C2 H2 N) and 28 amu (C H2 N) employing femtosecond laser ionization.

This paper describes a DESI source that produces a spray plume with an effective desorption/ionization area of 3.6 cm 2, some 200 times larger than given by conventional DESI sources. Rhodamine 6G and several drugs of abuse (codeine, heroin and diazepam) were used to demonstrate the ability to use large-area DESI MS to perform rapid (a few seconds) representative sampling of areas of the order of several square centimetres without scanning the probe across the surface. The large area ion source displayed high sensitivity (limits of detection in the high nanogram range) and high reproducibility (∼20 to 35% relative standard deviation).

Surfaces with different topographies and compositions were also tested. Using this method, absolute limits of detection observed for HMX and RDX from plastic surfaces and skin were found to be as low as 10 ng cm-2.

Close to the sample/confinement interface, where reaction quenching occurs, a non-stoichiometric alumina (Al2.667O4) was observed, being its XRD intensity correlated to the hercynite amount. Fe3Al intermetallic phase was found in the products of over aluminized mixtures. A reaction mechanism was proposed comprising: (i) Fe2O3 reduction to Fe3O4 and FeO; (ii) Al oxidation to Al2O3; (iii) interaction of the remaining Al with Fe3O4 and FeO with formation of iron-aluminates (hercynite) and iron; (iv) for the over aluminized mixtures, incorporation of Al into the iron-aluminates takes place with the formation of iron and alumina and, in parallel, Al reacts with iron to produce intermetallics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The said relationship was used to predict the Arrhenius parameters (Ea and log A values) of four plastic explosives based on RDX and one high explosive based on PETN (Semtex). The slopes EaR-1 of Kissinger's equation were specified by means of non-isothermal differential thermal analysis (DTA) and evaluation of the measurement results by means of the Kissinger method. The role played by binders and plasticizers in thermal decomposition of nitramines was pointed out on the basis of relationship between the Ea values obtained from VST and the EaR-1 values obtained from DTA, both for plastic explosives, eight nitramines, Composition B and PETN. The relationships between the EaR-1 values and thermostability threshold was specified for the given group of explosives. The relationship classify some of the studied plastic explosives as belonging to nitramines with steric hindrance in the molecule (CPX, TNAZ and HNIW). The relationship between EaR-1 values and drop energies, Edr, sharply differentiates between plastic explosives and individual nitramines. From the relationship between the Edr and D2 values it was found that the increasing performance of the studied nitramines and plastic explosives is connected with the decrease in their impact sensitivity. Also specified are the approximate linear dependences between the peak temperatures of exothermic decomposition of all the explosives studied and their ignition temperatures, Tig, or critical temperatures, Tc; these dependences were applied to prediction of Tig and Tc of both the studied plastic explosives and some of the nitramines. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This method allows reliable prediction of detonation performance for the above compounds. It uses a new general correlation containing important explosive parameters such as the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and two other structural parameters. The predicted results are compared to the results of best available methods for different family of energetic compounds. This method is also tested for various explosives with complex molecular structures. It is shown that the predicted results are more reliable with respect to the best well-developed simple methods. © 2009.","2-s2.0-67649803155"

Molecular dynamics (MD) method was employed to investigate their binding energies (E bind), compatibility, safety, mechanical properties, and energetic properties. The information and rules were reported for choosing better binders and guiding formulation design of high energy density material (HEDM). According to the calculated binding energies, the ordering of compatibility and stability of the five PBXs was predicted as ε-CL-20/PEG > ε-CL-20/Estane5703 ≈ ε-CL-20/GAP > ε-CL-20/HTPB > ε-CL-20/F2314. By pair correlation function g(r) analyses, hydrogen bonds and vdw are found to be the main interactions between the two components. The elasticity and isotropy of PBXs based ε-CL-20 can be obviously improved more than pure ε-CL-20 crystal. It is not by changing the molecular structures of ε-CL-20 for each binder to affect the sensitivity. The safety and energetic properties of these PBXs are mainly influenced by the thermal capability (C°p) and density (ρ) of binders, respectively. © 2007 Science in China Press.","2-s2.0-36849092895"
