2-s2.0-85060116748,"                             Herein we demonstrate the synthesis of Ag-Cu alloy NPs through a consecutive two-step process; laser ablation followed by laser irradiation. Initially, pure Ag and Cu NPs were produced individually using the laser ablation in liquid technique (with ∼50 femtosecond pulses at 800 nm) which was followed by laser irradiation of the mixed Ag and Cu NPs in equal volume. These Ag, Cu, and Ag-Cu NPs were characterised by UV-visible absorption, HRTEM and XRD techniques. The alloy formation was confirmed by the presence of a single surface plasmon resonance peak in absorption spectra and elemental mapping using FESEM techniques. Furthermore, the results from surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) studies performed for the methylene blue (MB) molecule suggested that Ag-Cu alloy NPs demonstrate a higher enhancement factor (EF) compared to pure Ag/Cu NPs. Additionally, SERS studies of Ag-Cu alloy NPs were implemented for the detection of explosive molecules such as picric acid (PA-5 μM), ammonium nitrate (AN-5 μM) and the dye molecule methylene blue (MB-5 nM). These alloy NPs exhibited superiority in the detection of various analyte molecules with good reproducibility and high sensitivity with EFs in the range of 10                             4                              to 10                             7                             .                          © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Satya Bharati M.S., Chandu B., Rao S.V.",57193805372;57193802221;57209992249;,Explosives sensing using Ag-Cu alloy nanoparticles synthesized by femtosecond laser ablation and irradiation,2019,RSC Advances,9,3,,1517,1525,NA,77,10.1039/C8RA08462A,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060116748&doi=10.1039%2fC8RA08462A&partnerID=40&md5=235210406ccd377e30261564462be5e7,"Advanced Centre for Research in High Energy Materials (ACRHEM), University of Hyderabad, Prof. C.

The vacuum-specific impulses were in the range 264.0-271.9 s, which was greater than most reported solid hypergolic materials. Moreover, the hypergolic performance of these compounds was examined by using 100% HNO3 as the oxidizer, and their catalytic performance in the hypergolic reaction of typical energetic ionic liquids and 90% H2O2 was comprehensively studied. All compounds displayed excellent hypergolic performance with the shortest ignition delay time of 4 ms. The examined copper-containing energetic complexes displayed excellent catalytic activities for the hypergolic reaction between energetic ionic liquids and 90% H2O2. The shortest ignition delay time of the examined hypergolic reactions was 31 ms.

2-s2.0-85106591141,"Due to unique abilities of the animals regarding analysis of complex gas substances, they still remain a gold standard in analysis of explosives. Unusual capabilities of biological chemosensory systems, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, stimulate elaboration of the devices mimicking their activity and operation parameters as precisely as possible. The electronic analogues are a subject of investigation in many research centres, which brings their successful commercialization closer. They are believed to substitute or to complement animals in the analysis of gas substances, including explosive and hazardous ones. The limitations of classic gas sensors can be overcome using the strategies inspired by the solutions known from biological systems. Apart from high selectivity and sensitivity desired for analysis of the explosives, mimicking biological systems allows overcoming other problems connected mainly with effective sampling and odour localization. Presented review is focused on the biomimetic devices, which mimic the sense of smell in a direct way and which are the inspiration to design the devices used for detection of the explosives. Potential of biosensors and bioelectronic noses (B-ENs) to mimic the incredibly accurate and versatile “biological noses” was evaluated.

2-s2.0-85114188043,"The sensitive and selective determination of peroxide-based explosives (PBEs) in the field/on site is an important analytical challenge. Most methods claiming to detect PBEs are indirect, actually detecting their decomposition product, H2O2. Here, we present an electrochemical sensor for direct detection of organic peroxide explosives, that is, triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylenetriperoxide diamine (HMTD), using well-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyethyleneimine (MWCNTs/PEI)-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode, namely, GC/MWCNTs/PEI electrode. This is the first use of the conductive polyelectrolyte PEI as an electrode modifier for pristine PBE sensing. The potential range, scan rate, solvent selection, and supporting electrolyte concentration were optimized for PBEs. As a distinct advantage over other similar methods, our sensor electrode responded to intact TATP solutions in neutral medium, meaning that TATP did not interact with acids/bases that would transform it into H2O2. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 10-200 mg L-1 for TATP and 25-200 mg L-1 for HMTD. Using differential pulse voltammetry, detection limits of 1.5 mg L-1 TATP and 3.0 mg L-1 HMTD were obtained from direct electrochemical reduction in 80/20% (v/v) H2O-acetone solvent medium. Electroactive camouflage materials such as passenger belongings (e.g., sweetener, detergent, sugar, and paracetamol-caffeine-based analgesic drugs), common ions, and other explosives were shown not to interfere with the proposed method. The nonresponsive behavior of our electrode to H2O2 prevents """"false positives""""from other peroxide materials of everyday use. This electrochemical sensor could also detect other nitro-explosives at different potentials and was statistically validated against standard GC-MS and spectrophotometric methods.  © ","Arman A., Saǧlam Ş., Üzer A., Apak R.",57205448208;50263050900;8258157100;7005910420;,Direct Electrochemical Determination of Peroxide-Type Explosives Using Well-Dispersed Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Polyethyleneimine-Modified Glassy Carbon Electrodes,2021,Analytical Chemistry,93,33,,11451,11460,NA,14,10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01397,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114188043&doi=10.1021%2facs.analchem.1c01397&partnerID=40&md5=9e660b77849c07256c45895ffb3ee120,"Institute of Graduate Studies, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey; Engineering Faculty, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey; Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA), Bayraktar Neighborhood, Vedat Dalokay St. No: 112, Cankaya, Ankara, 06670, Turkey","Arman, A., Institute of Graduate Studies, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey, Engineering Faculty, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey; Saǧlam, Ş., Engineering Faculty, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey; Üzer, A., Engineering Faculty, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey; Apak, R., Engineering Faculty, Chemistry Department, Istanbul University - Cerrahpaşa, Avcilar, Istanbul, 34320, Turkey, Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA), Bayraktar Neighborhood, Vedat Dalokay St. No: 112, Cankaya, Ankara, 06670, Turkey",,Acetone; Amines; Drug products; Electrochemical sensors; Electrolytic reduction; Explosives; Explosives detection; Glass; Glass membrane electrodes; Hydrogen peroxide; Nanotubes; Oxidation; Peroxides; Polyelectrolytes; Spectrophotometry; Voltammetry; Differential pulse voltammetry; Electrochemical determination; Electrochemical reductions; Glassy carbon electrodes; Selective determination; Spectro-photometric method; Supporting electrolyte; Triacetone triperoxide; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN),"Apak, R.; Engineering Faculty, Turkey; email: rapak@istanbul.edu.tr

2-s2.0-85108120616,"Rapid in situ detection and analysis of trace vapor concentrations at a sub-parts per billion to parts per trillion level remains a challenge for many applications such as indoor air-quality analysis and detection of explosives and narcotics. Micro-gas chromatography (μGC) together with a micro-photoionization detector (μPID) is a prominent method for portable analysis of complex vapor mixtures, but current μPID technology demonstrates poor detection performance compared to benchtop flame ionization detectors (FIDs). This work demonstrates the development of a significantly improved μPID with a sub-picogram detection limit (as low as ∼0.2 pg) comparable to or exceeding that of a benchtop FID, with a large linear dynamic range (>4 orders of magnitude) and robustness (high stability over 200 h of plasma activation). Based on this μPID, a complete μGC-PID system was built and tested on standard sample chromatograms in a laboratory setting to show the system's analytical capabilities and the detection limit down to sub-parts per trillion concentrations (as low as 0.14 ppt). Practical in-field chromatograms on breath and car exhaust were also generated to demonstrate applicability for in situ experimentation. This work shows that μGC-PID systems can be competitive with traditional GC-FID methods and thus opens a door to rapid trace vapor analysis in the field.  © ","Wei-Hao Li M., Ghosh A., Venkatasubramanian A., Sharma R., Huang X., Fan X.",57224631101;57198664721;55328156300;57209506549;57215604142;57216997490;,High-Sensitivity Micro-Gas Chromatograph-Photoionization Detector for Trace Vapor Detection,2021,ACS Sensors,6,6,,2348,2355,NA,29,10.1021/acssensors.1c00482,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108120616&doi=10.1021%2facssensors.1c00482&partnerID=40&md5=7e510320d4cfb2f4e1902a519ffc7da5,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States","Wei-Hao Li, M., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Ghosh, A., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Venkatasubramanian, A., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Sharma, R., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Huang, X., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States; Fan, X., Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States, Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSensing and Systems (WIMS2), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, United States",high sensitivity; low detection limit; photoionization detector; portable gas chromatography; trace vapor analysis; volatile organic compounds,"Air quality; Chromatographic analysis; Explosives detection; Gas chromatography; Indoor air pollution; Ionization of gases; Photoionization; Plasma stability; Trace analysis; Detection of explosives; Detection performance; Flame ionization detectors; Linear dynamic ranges; Micro-gas chromatography; Orders of magnitude; Photoionization detectors; Vapor concentrations; Quality control; gas; gas chromatography; Chromatography, Gas; Gases","Fan, X.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, United States; email: xsfan@umich.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The results of the portable GC–MS were compared to a benchtop GC–MS throughout this study. Sub-nanogram (ng) instrumental detection limits were achieved for each of the following analytes of interest (3-NT, 2,4-DNT, DPA, EC, DBP and 2-NDPA). Three different dynamic sampling methods were used with the CMV to sample and preconcentrate the volatiles prior to analysis. The headspace of a closed system was sampled over 10 min resulting in recoveries between 0.3 and 12%. Simulated open-air vapor sampling using a previously described vapor source resulted in an improvement of analyte recovery (ranging from 1.6 to 25%), for the same 10-minute sampling. A novel, continuous vapor delivery and sampling system was used, for the first time, to facilitate the delivery of sub-nanogram quantities of explosive analytes. The new continuous delivery system achieved significantly higher recoveries (3.0–89%) for all the analytes while requiring less sampling time (∼5 min) and sampling volumes than the other sampling techniques.

T1 is composed of a central 4H-1, 2, 4-triazole (TAZ) “core” and three external triphenylamine (TPA) groups. Its spin-coating films can realize the multi-analyte fluorescent prober to detect DNT (2, 4-dinitrotoluene), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, the substitute for triacetone triperoxide (TATP)) and diethylchlorophosphate (DCP, the substitute for Sarin) vapors. Additionally, the combination of the triple sensing mechanism in the different channels affords three distinct sets of output-signal responses, these three hazardous compounds could be identified rapidly with high sensitivity and selectivity: fluorescence turn-off response to DNT, fluorescence turn-on response to H2O2 and fluorometric-colorimetric dual-channel response to DCP. T1 fluorescent probe is highly advantageous for concurrently monitoring various hazardous target substances and simultaneously possessing the desirable sensitivity and selectivity, excellent reusability. Hereby, this study provides a prototype method to build novel multifunctional fluorescent probes to explosives and CWAs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Zheng P., Abdurahman A., Zhang Z., Feng Y., Zhang Y., Ai X., Li F., Zhang M.",57218382354;57200533755;57193067739;57196019433;57194570954;57192708462;56427161200;57199246941;,"A simple organic multi-analyte fluorescent prober: One molecule realizes the detection to DNT, TATP and Sarin substitute gas",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,409,,124500,,,NA,24,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124500,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096146400&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2020.124500&partnerID=40&md5=6015cdeb0adcbcc2e8378958959f17d8,"State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China","Zheng, P., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Abdurahman, A., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Zhang, Z., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Feng, Y., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Zhang, Y., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Ai, X., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Li, F., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Zhang, M., State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China","4H-1, 2, 4-triazole; DNT; Multifunctional fluorescent probe; Sarin; TATP","Chemical detection; Chemical warfare; Explosives; Hazards; Molecules; Probes; Reusability; 2 ,4-dinitrotoluene; Chemical warfare agents; Fluorescent probes; Hazardous compounds; Output signal response; Sensing mechanism; Spin-coating film; Triacetone triperoxide; Fluorescence; chemical warfare agent; fluorescent dye; hydrogen peroxide; palladium acetate; sarin; tetrahydrofuran; triacetone triperoxide; coating; detection method; hydrogen peroxide; instrumentation; oxide group; phosphate; recycling; sensitivity analysis; chemical structure; colorimetry; column chromatography; controlled study; density functional theory; electrophilicity; environmental temperature; fluorescence; fluorescence intensity; fluorometry; gas; nucleophilicity; photoluminescence; proton transport; spin coating; synthesis; vapor pressure; X ray diffraction","Li, F.; State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, China; email: lifeng01@jlu.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85107099849,"Energetic materials have been widely used in both military and civilian fields. The development of new high-energy materials with improved performance and enhanced stability is critical for promoting future military and space applications. Recently, researchers in the field of energetic materials have paid significant attention to oxadiazole-based energetic compounds, among which 1,3,4-oxadiazole demonstrates moderate energy levels and better stability, owing to the absence of readily cleaved N−O bonds compared with other oxadiazole isomers, such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 1,2,5-oxadiazole. Therefore, 1,3,4-oxadiazole is an exceptional explosophoric motif with an efficient compromise between energy and stability, and several outstanding energetic materials have been achieved based on the combination of 1,3,4-oxadiazole units with various functional groups or rings, such as polynitrobenzene, furazan, pyrazole, and 1,3,4-oxadiazole itself. This review provides an overview of the development of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based energetic materials during the past few years, outlines their synthesis and energetic performance, and contrasts them with other conventional energetic materials. Owing to the convenience of the synthetic routes and their excellent energetic properties, energetic materials based on the 1,3,4-oxadiazole skeleton may be considered as the next-generation of high-performance energetic materials specifically as heat-resistant explosives or insensitive explosives. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Du Y., Qu Z., Wang H., Cui H., Wang X.",57191588828;57224162329;55655644800;57199368350;21740103500;,"Review on the Synthesis and Performance for 1,3,4-Oxadiazole-Based Energetic Materials",2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,6,,860,874,NA,14,10.1002/prep.202000318,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107099849&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000318&partnerID=40&md5=71f51fc74f4432b71cc1d2310c5ba55b,"High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China; Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Advanced Energy Technology, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710119, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Special Fuel Chemistry and Material, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China","Du, Y., High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China; Qu, Z., High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China; Wang, H., High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China, Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Advanced Energy Technology, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710119, China, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Special Fuel Chemistry and Material, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China; Cui, H., High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Special Fuel Chemistry and Material, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China; Wang, X., High-Tech Institute of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Special Fuel Chemistry and Material, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710025, China","1,3,4-Oxadiazole; Energetic materials; Explosives; Review; Thermal stability","Explosives; Isomers; Space applications; 1 , 3 , 4-oxadiazole; Energetic compounds; Energetic properties; Enhanced stability; Heat-resistant explosives; Insensitive explosives; Oxadiazoles; Synthetic routes; Military applications","Wang, H.; High-Tech Institute of Xi'anChina; email: wang-hc12@tsinghua.org.cn",Review,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85113622409,"We report here that optically resonant donor copolymers are used to amplify the sensitivity of an electron-rich fluorescent copolymer toward electron-deficient nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). In a polymer-polymer system, we found that ultrafast Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) enhances the sensitivity of the primeval fluorescent polymer sensor by 6-fold approximately toward the conventional NACs like 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). The present article reports an optical sensor for sensitive detection of NACs by using a fluorescent probe based on FRET phenomena between P[DMA-co-(Boc-Trp-EMA)] (RP) bearing a tryptophan derivative as a donor and P[MMA-co-(Ala-HEMA)-co-(Dansyl-Ala-HEMA)] (DCP) bearing a dansyl derivative in the side chain as an acceptor. This elegant method thus paves the way to achieving a sensitivity <1 μM with a very high value of Stern-Volmer constant. Further, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved, and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy were performed to establish the quenching mechanism comprehensively. We also carried out a contact mode analysis in solid-state phase through strip tests for visual detection of NACs in ambient conditions. This unique and quality performance of our sensing probe makes it convenient for naked-eye detection and therefore gives an escalation for stand-alone sensors for NACs, particularly reinforcement in the field of analytical and forensic sciences.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Kumar V., Saini S.K., Choudhury N., Kumar A., Maiti B., De P., Kumar M., Satapathi S.",57212900969;57234386900;57200554860;57209569508;57197982652;7101660872;57214630163;36610769900;,Highly Sensitive Detection of Nitro Compounds Using a Fluorescent Copolymer-Based FRET System,2021,ACS Applied Polymer Materials,3,8,,4017,4026,NA,27,10.1021/acsapm.1c00540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113622409&doi=10.1021%2facsapm.1c00540&partnerID=40&md5=09573519bf6b46d188745e138c40050a,"Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Uttarakhand, Roorkee, 247667, India; Advanced Materials and Device Metrology Division, National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, 110012, India; Polymer Research Centre and Centre for Advanced Functional Materials, Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, West Bengal, Nadia, 741246, India","Kumar, V., Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Uttarakhand, Roorkee, 247667, India; Saini, S.K., Advanced Materials and Device Metrology Division, National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, 110012, India; Choudhury, N., Polymer Research Centre and Centre for Advanced Functional Materials, Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, West Bengal, Nadia, 741246, India; Kumar, A., Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Uttarakhand, Roorkee, 247667, India; Maiti, B., Polymer Research Centre and Centre for Advanced Functional Materials, Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, West Bengal, Nadia, 741246, India; De, P., Polymer Research Centre and Centre for Advanced Functional Materials, Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, West Bengal, Nadia, 741246, India; Kumar, M., Advanced Materials and Device Metrology Division, National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, 110012, India; Satapathi, S., Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Uttarakhand, Roorkee, 247667, India",copolymer; fluorescence quenching; FRET; nitroaromatics; sensor; ultrafast transient absorption,"Amino acids; Cyclic voltammetry; Energy transfer; Eye protection; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Forster resonance energy transfer; Polymers; Probes; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Highly sensitive detections; Nitroaromatic compound; Quenching mechanisms; Resonance energy transfer; Steady state fluorescences; Stern-Volmer constants; Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy; Absorption spectroscopy","Satapathi, S.; Department of Physics, Uttarakhand, India; email: soumitra.satapathi@ph.iitr.ac.in",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85113177161,"Background: High profile terrorist attacks in major capital cities have seemingly become a regular occurrence and the resultant mass-casualty events continue to challenge health care systems. Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) addresses unique terrorism-related issues relating to the mitigation, preparedness, and response measures to asymmetric, multi-modality terrorist attacks. This study is an epidemiological examination of all terrorism-related events sustained from 1970-2019, analyzing historical weapon types used and the resulting fatal injuries (FI) and non-fatal injuries (NFI) sustained. Methods: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks from 1970-2019. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria, as set by the GTD codebook. Ambiguous events were excluded. State-sponsored terrorist events do not meet the codebook's definition, and as such, are excluded from the study. Available counts of FI and NFI in each incident were then sorted and aggregated by weapon type to enable mean and standard deviation calculations. Results: In total, 168,003 events were recorded from the years 1970-2019. Explosives, bombs, and/or dynamite (E/B/D) were the most commonly used weapon type and accounted for 48.78% of all terrorism events, followed by the use of firearms in 26.77% of events. A total of 339,435 FI and 496,225 NFI resulted from all terrorism events that occurred during the study period. Combined, E/B/D and firearms accounted for 75.55% of all events, 67.1% of all FI, and 79.3% of all NFI. Each individual terrorism event inflicted a mean FI rate of 2.14 FI per event (SD = 10.2) and a mean NFI rate of 3.22 NFI per event (SD = 45.19). Conclusions: Although terrorism is complex and does not solely rely on death tolls as a measure of success, this analysis shows a historic mean FI rate of 2.14 and NFI rate of 3.22 per event over the past 50 years. Proven weapons such as E/B/D and firearms combine to account for over 75% of weapon types used in all events. Use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) such as chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons has been rare (0.2%), yet has extreme high potential to inflict mass casualties with mean NFI rates of 49.62 and 28.75 for chemical and biological weapons, respectively.  © 2021 Authors","Tin D., Margus C., Ciottone G.R.",16507735200;56080716600;6506051630;,"Half-a-century of terrorist attacks: Weapons selection, casualty outcomes, and implications for counter-terrorism medicine",2021,Prehospital and Disaster Medicine,36,5,,526,530,NA,24,10.1017/S1049023X21000868,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113177161&doi=10.1017%2fS1049023X21000868&partnerID=40&md5=ff8524ac6156f00a337faac2df938dcd,"BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, United States; BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States","Tin, D., BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, United States; Margus, C., BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, United States; Ciottone, G.R., BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States",CBRNE; counter-terrorism medicine; disaster medicine; mass casualty; terrorism,"disaster planning; factual database; firearm; human; mass disaster; terrorism; Databases, Factual; Disaster Planning; Firearms; Humans; Mass Casualty Incidents; Terrorism","Tin, D.; BIDMC Disaster Medicine Fellowship, United States; email: derrick@alphazodiac.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85109571942,"This work develops a facile synthesis for aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active hyperbranched polyglycidols (HPGs) to design a solid-state sensor for detecting nitroaromatic explosives. The tetraphenylethylene moieties were conjugated onto the periphery of the HPGs in a single step using dynamic boronate ester cross-linkers. The resulting AIE-active HPGs exhibited excellent AIE characteristics in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O mixtures, emitting a strong blue fluorescence under UV irradiation. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analyses demonstrated that the self-assembled nanosized aggregates were stable in the THF/H2O mixture. The fluorescence of the aggregates was dramatically quenched by various nitro compounds, including 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (or picric acid; PA), 2,6-dinitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitrotoluene, and nitromethane. The nano-aggregates exhibited extraordinary sensitivity towards PA, with a Stern‒Volmer constant (Ksv) of 2.27 × 104 M−1 and a limit of detection of 40 ppb.

2-s2.0-85107726675,"A reusable, low–cost, and convenient ethylenediamine (EDA)–bound magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs)–based colorimetric sensor has been developed for dual function colorimetric determination of nitroaromatic explosives such as TNT and tetryl. Colorimetric detection of analytes may occur through two independent routes: (1) nano−Fe3O4− EDA− NH2 as σ−donor may interact with the σ− and π−acceptor aromatic−poly(NO2) groups to produce a colored charge−transfer (CT) complex; (2) nano−Fe3O4−EDA−NH2 as a Fenton-type nanozyme may generate reactive species that comprise hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with H2O2 to oxidize 3,3′,5,5′–tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue-colored diimine (oxTMB−TMB) CT complex, where this color is bleached with TNT/tetryl because of donor−acceptor interactions between the explosive –NO2 groups and the –NH2 group of Fe3O4−EDA nanoparticles of restricted nanozyme activity. Both methods can quantify TNT well below the EPA recommended TNT residential screening level in soil, LOD being in the micromolar range. As EDA was covalently bound to MNPs, the same sensor can be separately reused six times for TNT and eight times for tetryl determination, using method (1). Common metal ions, anions, energetic materials, several camouflage materials, and soil components such as humates did not interfere with the nanosensor performance for TNT and tetryl. The combination of charge−transfer and nanozyme ability of Fe3O4− EDA−NH2 nanoparticles may bring a new approach to dual function colorimetric sensor design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual function colorimetric sensor for TNT and tetryl using the same nanoparticles as sensing elements in two different detection systems involving either formation or bleaching of colored species.

2-s2.0-85117425566,"Warfare threats and acts of terror are challenging situations encountered by defense agencies across the globe and are of growing concern to the general public, and security- minded policy makers. Detecting ultra-low quantities of explosive compounds in remote locations or under harsh conditions for anti-terror purposes as well as the environmental monitoring of residual or discarded explosives in soil, remains a major challenge. The use of metal nanoparticles (NPs) for trace explosive detection has drawn considerable interest in recent years. For nano-based explosive sensor devices to meet real-life operational demands, analytical parameters such as, long-shelf life, stability under harsh conditions, ease-of-use, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and rapid signal response must be met. Generally, the analytical performance of colorimetric-based nanosensor systems is strongly dependent on the surface properties of the nanomaterial used in the colorimetric assay. The size and shape properties of metal NPs, surface functionalisation efficiency, and assay fabrication methods, are factors that influence the efficacy of colorimetric explosive nanosensor systems. This review reports on the design and analytical performances of colorimetric explosive sensor systems using metal NPs as optical signal transducers. The challenges of trace explosive detection, advances in metal NP colorimetric explosive design, limitations of each methods, and possible strategies to mitigate the problems are discussed.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Adegoke O., Daeid N.N.",53982526500;57216327506;,"Colorimetric optical nanosensors for trace explosive detection using metal nanoparticles: Advances, pitfalls, and future perspective",2021,Emerging Topics in Life Sciences,5,5,,367,379,NA,11,10.1042/ETLS20200281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117425566&doi=10.1042%2fETLS20200281&partnerID=40&md5=fd169976da4fc2f85fd6b977f0ca7921,"School of Science and Engineering, Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 4GH, United Kingdom","Adegoke, O., School of Science and Engineering, Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 4GH, United Kingdom; Daeid, N.N., School of Science and Engineering, Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 4GH, United Kingdom",,explosive; metal; metal nanoparticle; nanomaterial; colorimetry; Colorimetry; Explosive Agents; Metal Nanoparticles; Metals; Nanostructures,"Adegoke, O.; School of Science and Engineering, United Kingdom; email: o.adegoke@dundee.ac.uk",Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The obtained experimental data on the dependence of the detonation velocity on the density of TKX-50 samples agree with the results of calculations, in which the experimentally determined enthalpy of formation 194.1 kJ mol−1 is used. The energetic performance of TKX-50 surpasses the parameters of nitramines RDX, HMX, and even CL-20, determined at the same densities. However, the calculated detonation velocity of TKX-50 at theoretical maximum density is 9287 m s−1, which is slightly lower than the detonation velocity of CL-20 at maximum density. It is worth noting that the detonation velocity of the TKX-50 at the experimentally attainable density (1.8 g cm−3) is 9037 m s−1.

2-s2.0-85104435590,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are promising candidates for detection of nitroaromatic explosives. However, the major limitation of these AIE PNPs is the complicated synthesis and deteriorated detection accuracy because of the poor colloidal and morphological stability. This study provided a facile method to construct AIE PNPs with highly cross-linked polymer matrix for sensitive and accurate detection of nitroaromatic explosives. The highly cross-linked AIE PNPs with a ~50 nm particle size were prepared through copolymerization of divinylbenzene (DVB) and a tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based AIE luminogen, (4′-tetraphenyletheyl)pheny-3-butenylether (TPE-PBE), in a water-borne miniemulsion system. Due to the good aqueous dispersibility and highly cross-linked polymer matrix, the poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs showed excellent solvent resistance, and sensitive and accurate detection of nitroaromatic explosives in aqueous systems, especially picric acid (PA). Moreover, a rigid poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) film could preserve spherical morphology after coating poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs onto various substrates (such as filter paper and glass slide). The high surface area and loose packing of poly(DVB-co-TPE-PBE) NPs offered convenience for 2,4-dinitrotoluene to diffuse and interact with TPE-PBE units.

2-s2.0-85103696860,"A series of detonation performance experiments are described for the plastic-bonded high explosive (HE) PBX 9012, nominally composed of 90% octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazine (HMX) and 10% polymeric binder vinylidene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (Viton VTR-5883), by weight. The experiments provide information on the PBX 9012's detonation propagation properties and metal pushing characteristics. Although this HE formulation has been in use for 50 years as a booster (compositionally similar to LX-07), our new data represent the first full detonation performance characterization for the HE (along with recently reported shock initiation experiments). Here, we compare the new PBX 9012 data with the well-studied PBX 9501 (95% HMX and 5% polymeric binder), establishing how the 5% difference in HMX content between the explosives is manifested in the performance measurements. A scaling argument based on the known energetic material content in a large selection of high HMX content formulations is also given to help explain the observed results. Finally, the accumulated PBX 9012 data is used to generate performance models using both programmed and reactive burn techniques, providing an additional avenue to compare PBX 9012 to the more energetic PBX 9501. © 2021","Anderson E.K., Chiquete C., Jackson S.I., Chicas R.I., Short M.",57198919254;22950136100;7402695193;57222672065;7101631450;,The comparative effect of HMX content on the detonation performance characterization of PBX 9012 and PBX 9501 high explosives,2021,Combustion and Flame,230,,111415,,,NA,12,10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111415,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103696860&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2021.111415&partnerID=40&md5=1b171a3365fe46cb2a11427ff63de6c4,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Anderson, E.K., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Chiquete, C., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Jackson, S.I., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Chicas, R.I., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Short, M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Calibration; Detonation performance; High explosive; HMX; Programmed burn; Reactive burn,"Binders; Detonation; Detonation performance; Hexafluoropropylene; High explosives; PBX 9501; Performance characterization; Performance experiment; Polymeric binder; Programmed burn; Reactive burn; Tetrazines; Calibration; copolymer; explosive; octahydro 1,3,5,7 tetranitro 1,3,5,7 tetrazine; pbx 9012; pbx 9501; tetrazine derivative; unclassified drug; vinylidene hexafluoropropylene; Article; calibration; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; combustion; electric potential; geometry; ionization; kinetics; mechanics; polymerization; priority journal; velocity","Chiquete, C.; Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States; email: chiquete@lanl.gov",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85102194439,"A novel procedure for the preparation of nanosized nitrocellulose (NC) was developed. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) water suspension was obtained by disk-milling of cotton powder. CNF was first pretreated using sulfonic acid to enhance the esterification process using HNO3 and H2SO4. The esterification process generated nitrocellulose nanofiber (NCNF) with a nitrogen content of 9.0 %–13.7 %. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of NCNF was ten times larger than that of NC, and the burning rate of NCNF was 3.5 times faster than that of NC. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted to assess the difference between the thermal stability of NCNF and NC. NCNF and NC exhibited the same onset exothermic temperature (200 °C), the height of the exothermic peak of NCNF was 20 % higher than that of NC. Thus, NCNF has great potential to be used in explosives due to its high combustion performance. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Okada K., Saito Y., Akiyoshi M., Endo T., Matsunaga T.",55460358200;57195302804;7005266765;35731148500;7401741196;,Preparation and Characterization of Nitrocellulose Nanofiber,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,6,,962,968,NA,22,10.1002/prep.202000240,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102194439&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000240&partnerID=40&md5=4340951a28c6ad6f2bee92678731e177,"Research Institute of Safety and Sustainability Department of Energy and Environment, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Research Institute for Sustainable Chemistry Department of Materials and Chemistry, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 3-11-32 Kagamiyama, Higshi, Hiroshima  739-0046, Japan","Okada, K., Research Institute of Safety and Sustainability Department of Energy and Environment, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Saito, Y., Research Institute for Sustainable Chemistry Department of Materials and Chemistry, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 3-11-32 Kagamiyama, Higshi, Hiroshima  739-0046, Japan; Akiyoshi, M., Research Institute of Safety and Sustainability Department of Energy and Environment, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Endo, T., Research Institute for Sustainable Chemistry Department of Materials and Chemistry, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 3-11-32 Kagamiyama, Higshi, Hiroshima  739-0046, Japan; Matsunaga, T., Research Institute of Safety and Sustainability Department of Energy and Environment, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan",burning velocity; cellulose nanofiber; esterification; nitrocellulose; specific surface area,Cellulose nanocrystals; Differential scanning calorimetry; Esters; Nanofibers; Nitric acid; Sulfuric acid; Thermodynamic stability; Brunauer emmett tellers; Cellulose nanofibers; Combustion performance; Exothermic peaks; Exothermic temperature; Nitrogen content; Sulfonic acid; Water suspensions; Nitrocellulose; Cellulose Nitrate; Combustion; Esterification; Esters; Nitric Acid; Processes; Sulfuric Acid,"Okada, K.; Research Institute of Safety and Sustainability Department of Energy and Environment, 1-1-1 Higashi, Japan; email: ken.okada@aist.go.jp",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85106154588,"Host–guest materials exhibit great potential applications as an insensitive high-energy–density explosive and low characteristic signal solid propellant. To investigate the mechanism of the improvement of the energy of host–guest explosives by guest molecules, ReaxFF-lg reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the thermal decomposition reactions of the host–guest explosives systems ICM-102/HNO3, ICM-102/H2O2, and pure ICM-102 under different constant high temperatures and different heating rates. Incorporation of guest molecules significantly increased the energy level of the host–guest system. However, the initial reaction path of the ICM-102 molecule was not changed by the guest molecules. The guest molecules did not initially participate in the host molecule reaction. After a period of time, the H2O2 and HNO3 guest molecules promoted cleavage of the C–N bond of the ICM-102 ring. Stronger oxidation and higher oxygen content resulted in the guest molecules more obviously accelerating destruction of the ICM-102 ring structure. The guest molecules accelerated the initial endothermic reaction of ICM-102, but they played a more important role in the intermediate exothermic reaction stage: incorporation of guest molecules (HNO3 and H2O2) greatly improved the heat release and exothermic reaction rate. Although the energies of the host–guest systems were clearly improved by incorporation of guest molecules, the guest molecules had little effect on the thermal stabilities of the systems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Xiao Y., Chen L., Yang K., Geng D., Lu J., Wu J.",57211810458;35995373600;57213425416;57201743091;55711006400;14017137300;,Mechanism of the improvement of the energy of host–guest explosives by incorporation of small guest molecules: HNO3 and H2O2 promoted C–N bond cleavage of the ring of ICM-102,2021,Scientific Reports,11,1,10559,,,NA,8,10.1038/s41598-021-89939-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106154588&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-89939-1&partnerID=40&md5=58aa688451c04bf258d9f414f164e993,"State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China","Xiao, Y., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Chen, L., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Yang, K., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Geng, D., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Lu, J., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Wu, J., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China",,,"Chen, L.; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, China; email: chenlang@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85106018884,"Quantification of near-field blast loading is a pressing issue for defence, transport security, and structural engineering. Realistic explosion scenarios often involve the detonation of non-spherical high explosive charges, rather than the idealised spherical/hemispherical explosives assumed in commonly employed semi-empirical approaches. Additionally, near-field effects are of great importance when assessing structural damage and injury risk from such an event. There is a need, therefore, to incorporate the effects of charge shape and the resulting loading distribution in simplified engineering-level tools using adjustments based on sound physical principles. This article details the development of an energy equivalent formulation to derive spherical equivalence factors, with the methodology illustrated for the scenario of a centrally detonated cylindrical explosive charge. A validated two-part numerical model is used to generate specific impulse distributions and quantify the resulting plate deformation, for a wide range of cylindrical aspect ratios (0.20≤L/D≤5), at a range of near-field scaled distances (0.108≤Z≤0.485 m/kg1/3) for different sized structural targets. A series of verification examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the method, with the peak deflection under the equivalent spherical charge matching peak deflection under the cylindrical charge to within ∼4%. The method developed in this article could be extended to find equivalence between any two systems with complex distributed loading, allowing for a fast running engineering approximation in cases where detailed modelling is inappropriate or infeasible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Rigby S.E., Osborne C., Langdon G.S., Cooke S.B., Pope D.J.",48662743300;57224086973;35253831900;57222275193;36931084300;,Spherical equivalence of cylindrical explosives: Effect of charge shape on deflection of blast-loaded plates,2021,International Journal of Impact Engineering,155,,103892,,,NA,25,10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2021.103892,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106018884&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijimpeng.2021.103892&partnerID=40&md5=7c510da9285df00e21dd768086b84582,"Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, United Kingdom; Physical Sciences Group, Platform Services Division, DSTL Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire  SP4 0JQ, United Kingdom","Rigby, S.E., Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, United Kingdom; Osborne, C., Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, United Kingdom; Langdon, G.S., Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, United Kingdom; Cooke, S.B., Physical Sciences Group, Platform Services Division, DSTL Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire  SP4 0JQ, United Kingdom; Pope, D.J., Physical Sciences Group, Platform Services Division, DSTL Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire  SP4 0JQ, United Kingdom",Blast loading; Cylindrical explosive; Energy equivalent impulse; Kinetic energy uptake; Plate deflection; Spherical equivalence,Aspect ratio; Explosives; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Plates (structural components); Risk assessment; Spheres; Structural analysis; Blast loading; Cylindrical explosive; Energy equivalent impulse; Explosive effect; Kinetic energy uptake; Near fields; Plate deflections; Pressung; Spherical equivalence; Transport security; Deflection (structures),"Rigby, S.E.; Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, United Kingdom",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85109926294,"Polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) have the characteristics of high energy density, and excellent safety and mechanical performances. In this work, a microfluidic crystallization system (MCS) based on microscale chaotic advection is proposed to control and optimize the crystallization environment of PBXs. Comparison with the macroscale method not only verifies the feasibility of the MSC in the preparation of PBXs, but it also boasts a narrower particle size distribution, regular morphology, and high crystal quality. Furthermore, based on the advantages of the rapid and simple preparation of the MCS, the suitable polymer-coated explosive composite system can be quickly screened out. Four typical binders were selected by the MCS to coat the nano-hexanitrostilbene (nano- HNS), and their properties were analyzed. On this basis, the surface modification and coating mechanism of the binder on HNS crystals and the effect of micro mixing conditions on PBXs crystal growth were studied. Finally, the anti-overload performance of four different PBXs was evaluated through air gun experiments. The results show that all four PBXs can maintain the stability of the charge under strong external dynamic load conditions. This study provides an efficient route to prepare PBXs with narrow particle size distribution, high crystal quality and resistant high overload.

2-s2.0-85100260722,"RDX is used widely as a practical secondary explosive for civilian and military applications because of its high chemical stability and explosive power. However, a major shortcoming of RDX is its high sensitivity which leads to numerous accidents by accidental initiation. One of the major challenges in worldwide energetic materials research is the design and synthesis of insensitive high performing explosives. In this work, N,N′-bis((1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA) (Mitchell et al., 2017) is obtained by a one-step reaction in >90 yield.

2-s2.0-85115000620,"Over the last few decades, the research for energetic materials with ultrahigh heat resistance and good energy level has been a highly severe challenge. In this study, a novel heat-resistant compound, 5,5′-bis(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)−2H,2′H-3,3′-bis-1,2,4-triazoles (BPT-2), was developed through the introduction of an energetic bis-1,2,4-triazoles bridge between two nitropyrazole moieties. This neutral molecule shows an ultrahigh thermal decomposition temperature of 425 °C that is extremely rare in the field of heat resistant explosives, enhanced energy level (detonation velocity: 7503 m s−1) superior to that of the extensively used heat resistant explosive HNS (7164 m s−1), insolubility in water and a facile three-step reaction. These prominent properties of BPT-2 support it as an advanced heat resistant explosive with great promise. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation on the influence of different heterocyclic ring bridges (i.e., bis-1,2,4-oxadiazoles in A, bis-1,3,4-oxadiazoles in B and bis-1,2,4-triazoles in BPT-2) on the thermal stability of the corresponding target compounds was performed.The result indicates that the preferable aromaticity and C-NO2 bond strength of bis-1,2,4-triazoles contribute to the excellent thermostability of BPT-2 in comparison to those of bis-1,2,4-oxadiazoles and bis-1,3,4-oxadiazoles analogues. This work is anticipated to prompt more research on the promising strategy of introducing energetic bis-1,2,4-triazoles bridges in the molecular design and offers guidance for the development of advanced heat resistant explosives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Yan T., Ma J., Yang H., Cheng G.",57211519430;57196296704;57071863200;7401862416;,"Introduction of energetic bis-1,2,4-triazoles bridges: A strategy towards advanced heat resistant explosives",2022,Chemical Engineering Journal,429,,132416,,,NA,37,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132416,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115000620&doi=10.1016%2fj.cej.2021.132416&partnerID=40&md5=0e8b7828618027937bcfad79272bef0b,"School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, China","Yan, T., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Ma, J., Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Yang, H., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Cheng, G., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China","Bis-1,2,4-triazoles; Energetic bridge; Heat resistant explosives; Prediction model; Thermal stability","Bridges; Decomposition; Explosives; Heat resistance; Bis-1,2,4-triazole; Detonation velocity; Energetic bridge; Heat resistant; Heat-resistant explosives; Neutral molecules; Nitropyrazoles; Oxadiazoles; Prediction modelling; Thermal decomposition temperature; Thermodynamic stability","Yang, H.; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, China; email: hyang@mail.njust.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85111158264,"Al/CuO nanothermites have displayed unique catalytic activities in accelerating the thermolysis of nitrocellulose (NC) and combustion characteristics of AP/HTPB propellant depending on the morphology of CuO. The kinetic triplet of NC-based composites was determined by multi- isoconversional methods, whereas the reaction models were reconstructed by employing a modified Šesták–Berggren equation based on the combined kinetic analysis. DSC and TG-FTIR results revealed that CuO and Al/CuO play crucial roles in accelerating the dissociation of –O–NO2 bond and the coacervate phase to change the pyrolysis mechanism of NC from an autocatalytic reaction to a modified n-th order reaction model. It was also demonstrated that nanothermites were provided with a low starting temperature of pyrolysis, reduced exothermic peak temperature, low activation energy, and high total weight loss, confirming their better catalytic activity than their corresponding CuO, of which Al/CuO nanothermite, containing the gypsophila paniculata-like CuO, performs the best. Further, the shape of CuO was found to be significant in enhancing the burning rate of AP/HTPB propellant containing thermites, with the gypsophila paniculata-like presenting the best catalytic effect (43% improvement).

2-s2.0-85101309189,"Explosives detection systems need to be able to reliably detect a wide range of explosive materials and their vapours. The continued development and improvement of artificial olfaction techniques, including electronic nose (EN), remains important to overcome existing challenges and meet requirements posed by new improvements in the field of explosives. There is an increasingly popular trend aimed at improvement of fundamental metrological parameters of sensors for the construction of sensor arrays for the detection of ultralow target analytes. Even after decades of developments, applications of artificial olfaction instruments aimed at selective and sensitive detection of trace quantities of explosives constitute still a difficult and challenging problem. Essential aspects of artificial olfaction were theoretically discussed with an emphasis on evaluation of enhancing sensors parameters in the detection of explosives. Progress in nanotechnology and prospects in mimicking biological sense of smell successively remove the boundaries of artificial olfaction technologies. A tendency towards improved selectivity and specificity of the sensors is evident. Elaboration of novel sensing materials, data processing systems and sampling procedures are the main approaches to increase sensors’ major metrological parameters. Implementation of designed construction solutions in practice and meeting particular requirements are still a bottleneck in the commercialization process. The demonstration of achievements in artificial olfaction technology during the last couple of years is reviewed and different strategies to enhance their properties are suggested.

The results show that the TA-Fe interface layer in Al@TA-Fe can effectively promote the ignition of aluminum powder, which can make the aluminum powder be ignited at the temperature far below the melting point of aluminum. Meanwhile, the carbides formed by the decomposition of tannic acid are beneficial to the cracking of the alumina on the surface of the aluminum powder, which can promote the internal aluminum to participate in the reaction and improve the reaction efficiency of aluminum. The TA-Fe layer can inhibit the agglomeration of molten aluminum during the combustion of aluminum and can effectively improve the corrosion resistance of aluminum powder.

2-s2.0-85105404190,"In the present work, copper ferrite was prepared by a simple and mild sol–gel method followed by low-temperature calcination, and characterized by various analytical techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis suggests that the copper ferrite with the spinel-type ferrite crystal forms have been successfully prepared. More crystal defects are observed in copper ferrite crystals than in the pure iron oxide and copper oxide crystals. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analyses reveal that the prepared copper ferrites are mesoporous structures with large specific surface areas and the specific surface area increases with the increase of Fe content. The effects of the structure of copper ferrite on its catalytic activity for the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and the catalytic mechanism were investigated and explored based on the thermogravimetric analysis of the decomposition process. It is found that the copper ferrites prepared at the molar ratios of Cu/Fe of 1/2 and 1/4 exhibit the best catalytic activities for the thermal decomposition of AP. The synergistic catalytic mechanism of Cu–Fe–O is proposed based on the electron transfer and proton transfer theories for the thermal decomposition of AP.

The main objective of this paper is to improve the properties of 3D printed propellants in terms of energy content and combustion behavior. Three propellant formulas, which contain polyurethane-acrylic acid resin as binder and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) as energetic filler, were fabricated by extrusion material 3D printing. The formulas with the force constant of 1107.43–1209.44 J/g were designed. The combustion behaviors of designed formulas, such as the maximum pressure, burn time, and burn rate, were characterized by closed bomb tests.

Therefore, in this review, the recent progress of different photothermal materials and their laser-induced performances have been summarized. First, an overview of optical ignition, especially laser ignition, including the main categories, mechanisms, advantages, and applications, was introduced. Then, different photothermal materials, including carbon-based materials, composite materials, explosives, and gaseous mixtures, were summarized, and their photothermal performances were listed and compared. Finally, the strategies and challenges of designing photothermal materials with optimized performance were discussed, which can provide suggestions for the choice of photothermal energetic materials and can provide primary guidance for the design and fabrication of the same for laser ignition applications. © 2021 The Authors","Deng H.-Y., Wang L., Tang D., Zhang Y., Zhang L.",57215026041;57075024400;57203149951;56283354200;58072524800;,Review on the laser-induced performance of photothermal materials for ignition application,2021,Energetic Materials Frontiers,2,3,,201,217,NA,21,10.1016/j.enmf.2021.08.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123774973&doi=10.1016%2fj.enmf.2021.08.001&partnerID=40&md5=4cbaa1b69e300a86021cac734164fb41,"Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Sichuan Co-Innovation Center for New Energetic Materials and School of National Defence Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, 621010, China","Deng, H.-Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Wang, L., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Tang, D., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Zhang, Y., Sichuan Co-Innovation Center for New Energetic Materials and School of National Defence Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, 621010, China; Zhang, L., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China",Ignition energy; Laser ignition; Photothermal materials; Photothermal performance,Electromagnetic pulse; Laser safety; Light absorption; Anti-electromagnetic; Ignition energies; Laser ignition; Laser induced; Performance; Photo-thermal; Photothermal material; Photothermal performance; Simple++; Additives,"Zhang, L.; Institute of Chemical Materials, Sichuan, China; email: zhanglong@caep.cn",Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85108109557,"Improving the density of parts, structural homogeneity, and mechanical properties are the most challenging issues in the PBX compaction process. In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted PBX compaction technique and equipment were introduced and designed. With this equipment, it is found that the density of compacted PBX parts increases, and the diameter expansion and density differences decrease by applying ultrasonic vibration. The influences of compaction pressure, hold time and particle size on the compaction were also analyzed. The results indicate that increasing the pressure and time, while decreasing the particle size, results in a higher density and strength of PBX parts. Then, the microstructures were analyzed to show the mechanism of density distributions. It is found that the density increase is due to the particle's rearrangement leading to a “dense” structure and smaller particle sizes with ultrasonic vibration. Finally, the compressive modulus and strength, and the tensile fracture and strength were found to increase by applying ultrasonic vibration. These mechanical properties decrease along the radial and axial direction, indicating the surface effect of the ultrasonic vibration. © 2021","Lv K., Yang K., Zhou B., Zhang F., Guo J., Han C., Tian Y.",57205570606;57844888800;57224661317;57224644913;57224630293;56529964200;55257595400;,The densification and mechanical behaviors of large-diameter polymer-bonded explosives processed by ultrasonic-assisted powder compaction,2021,Materials and Design,207,,109872,,,NA,12,10.1016/j.matdes.2021.109872,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108109557&doi=10.1016%2fj.matdes.2021.109872&partnerID=40&md5=ee23127862b621de4fbf1d82aa8a5950,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; School of Civil Engineering & Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China","Lv, K., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Yang, K., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Zhou, B., School of Civil Engineering & Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China; Zhang, F., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Guo, J., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Han, C., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China; Tian, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621999, China",Density behavior; Mechanical properties; PBX; Powder compaction; Ultrasonic-assisted processing,Density (specific gravity); Particle size; Powders; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Vibrations (mechanical); Densification behaviour; Density behavior; Large diameter; Mechanical; Mechanical behavior; Particles sizes; Powder compactions; Property; Ultrasonic-assisted processing; Ultrasonic-vibration; Compaction,"Tian, Y.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: tianyong@caep.cn",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The as-prepared C-dots were detailly characterized and discussed. Results demonstrated that C-dots were nearly spherical with an amorphous structure and an average diameter of 2.8 nm. C-dots exhibited a strong blue photoluminescence (26.8% quantum yield) with excitation-dependent properties and good stabilities against pH (6–12), salts and metal ions. Furthermore, C-dots were successfully developed for TNP sensing based on fluorescence quenching in water solution with high selectivity and sensitivity, and the detection limit was as low as 58.5 nM. The unchanged fluorescence lifetimes of C-dots suggested that luminescent quenching effect was predominantly caused by inner-filter effect (IFE).

2-s2.0-85107776515,"This work reports an eco-friendly hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of hexagonal NaCeF4:Tb3+/Eu3+nanophosphors. The phase, morphology and optical properties were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy respectively. Herein, the as-synthesized nanophosphor was functionalized with amine rich polyethylenimine (PEI) resulting in development of a luminescent nanoprobe bearing dual sensing functions for hazardous nitroaromatics and heavy metal ions. The strong photoluminescence emission of Eu3+ions was selectively quenched upon addition of toxic analytes at concentrations from 10 to 100 ppm due to complex formation between the analytes and PEI functionalized nanostructure. The synthesized nanomaterial shows sharp emission peaks at 493, 594, 624, 657 and 700 nm. Significantly, the peak at 594 nm shows a noticeable quenching effect on addition of toxic analytes to the aqueous solution of the nanocrystals. The nanophosphors are sensitive and efficient for the PA and Fe3+ion detection with an LOD of 1.32 ppm and 1.39 ppm. The Stern-Volmer (SV) quenching constant (KSV) is found to be 2.25 × 105M−1for PA and 3.8 × 104M−1for Fe3+ions. The highKSVvalue and low LOD suggest high selectivity and sensitivity of the nanosensor towards PA and Fe3+ions over other analytes. Additionally, a reduced graphene oxide and nanophosphor based nanocomposite was also synthesized to investigate the role of energy transfer involving delocalized energy levels of reduced graphene oxide in regulating the luminescence properties of the nanophosphor. It was observed that PEI plays central role in inhibiting the quenching effect of reduced graphene oxide on the nanophosphor. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Singhaal R., Tashi L., Nisa Z.U., Ashashi N.A., Sen C., Devi S., Sheikh H.N.",57220119988;57205188671;57217050867;57217044632;57217050946;58609719600;7006576724;,PEI functionalized NaCeF4:Tb3+/Eu3+for photoluminescence sensing of heavy metal ions and explosive aromatic nitro compounds,2021,RSC Advances,11,32,,19333,19350,NA,14,10.1039/d1ra02910j,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107776515&doi=10.1039%2fd1ra02910j&partnerID=40&md5=c7b318e71c53a118fe0f9349e9c11a04,"Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India","Singhaal, R., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Tashi, L., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Nisa, Z.U., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Ashashi, N.A., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Sen, C., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Devi, S., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India; Sheikh, H.N., Department of Chemistry, University of Jammu, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, Jammu, 180006, India",,Enamels; Energy transfer; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphene; Heavy metals; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrothermal synthesis; Metal ions; Optical properties; Photoluminescence; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Quenching; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Aromatic nitro compounds; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Functionalized nanostructures; Luminescence properties; Photoluminescence emission; Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD); Quenching constant; Optical emission spectroscopy,"Sheikh, H.N.; Department of Chemistry, Baba Sahib Ambedkar Road, India; email: hnsheikh@rediffmail.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85106454356,"Explosive nitroaromatic compounds (epNACs) are a class of molecules responsible for massive loss of life in the form of terror attacks and health hazards. Discerning detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) like mutagenic pollutant and epNACs using robust luminescent coordination polymers (CPs) has been always a potential research field for the sake of environmental health and homeland security. In this regard, one-dimensional (1D) CPs, {[Zn(adc)(avp)2(H2O)]·(H2O)3}n (1) and {[Cd(adc)(avp)2(H2O)]·(H2O)·(CH3OH)}n (2) {H2adc = acetylenedicarboxylic acid and avp = 4-[2-(9-anthryl)vinyl]pyridine} have been synthesized using H2adc and avp ligands into aqueous solution of the nitrate salts of corresponding metal ion. Both of the polymeric compounds show extensive hydrogen bonding and π···πstacking interactions to form three-dimensional (3D) structures. The presence of geometrically suitable proximal anthracene moieties (extended π-conjugation) in both the compounds provides feasible interacting sites for incoming analytes that also explains their prompt sensing property. Interestingly, both the fluorescent sensing probes exhibit highly efficient ratiometric and selective sensing ability toward TNP with fast response over other comparative epNACs. A detailed investigation on the mechanistic pathways for the quenching response has been obtained by density functional theory calculation.

2-s2.0-85108167752,"Disposal of used lubricant oil in an ecosystem is a serious environmental threat. In this context, recycling waste lubricant oil into a valuable product has an immense commercial and environmental significance and is a challenging area of research. In this article, we have demonstrated the use of waste lubricant oil as a partial replacement of diesel oil of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) explosives. Moreover, the effect on detonation properties and rock fragmentation patterns by the use of lubricant oil based ANFO in blasting operation has also been studied. The field trial experiments were carried out with lubricant oil based ANFO explosive to demonstrate the real applicability of the prepared explosive composition at Nimbeti Limestone open-pit mine of Shree Cement Limited, India. These explosive compositions revealed effective detonation performance. Importantly, air quality was analyzed during blasting operations to indicate that the emitted toxic fumes such as CO, NOx, and fine dust particles (PM2.5 & PM10) were found within the permissible limit at the mining area by the use of lubricant oil based explosives. Further, rock fragmentation analysis indicated that ANFO explosive compositions with 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % (w/w) lubricant oil in diesel oil revealed good rock fragmentation as compared with normal ANFO in the conducted experimental blast. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Ali F., Roy M.P., Pingua B.M.P., Mukherjee R., Agarwal L., Singh P.K.",56492290600;10738771700;9740887800;57224680911;57224684601;57220983883;,Utilization of Waste Lubricant Oil in Fuel Phase of ANFO Explosives: Its Field Applications and Environmental Impact,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,9,,1397,1404,NA,9,10.1002/prep.202100011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108167752&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202100011&partnerID=40&md5=26c1c338f81b5787c439aec1cb016b9b,"Rock Excavation Engineering Division, CSIR-Central institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Barwa road, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India; Smartchem Technologies Limited, Pune, 411 036, India","Ali, F., Rock Excavation Engineering Division, CSIR-Central institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Barwa road, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India; Roy, M.P., Rock Excavation Engineering Division, CSIR-Central institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Barwa road, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India; Pingua, B.M.P., Rock Excavation Engineering Division, CSIR-Central institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Barwa road, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India; Mukherjee, R., Smartchem Technologies Limited, Pune, 411 036, India; Agarwal, L., Smartchem Technologies Limited, Pune, 411 036, India; Singh, P.K., Rock Excavation Engineering Division, CSIR-Central institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Barwa road, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India",Air quality monitoring; Alternative Fuel; ANFO; Field applications; Recycling; Rock Fragmentation; Waste Oil,Air quality; Blasting; Combustion knock; Detonation; Diesel engines; Lime; Lubricating oils; Open pit mining; Rock bursts; Blasting operations; Detonation performance; Detonation properties; Environmental significance; Environmental threats; Partial replacement; Rock fragmentation; Waste lubricant oil; Petroleum industry,"Ali, F.; Rock Excavation Engineering Division, Barwa road, India; email: firojali@cimfr.nic.in",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85114416917,"Two new types of aluminized explosives TATB/HMX/Al and LLM-105/Al were formulated and compared with the formerly reported TATB/Al explosives in terms of thermal stability, mechanical sensitivity, and detonation performance. Firstly, the heat of the explosion was measured and two formulations were selected as the investigated samples. Next the thermal stability was studied by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) and thermal cook-off tests. Then the impact and friction sensitivity were measured, and finally the detonation performance was characterized by cylinder tests and particle velocity measurements of the detonation reaction zone. From the calorimetric data, the new types of explosives increase the heat of the explosion significantly. In terms of thermal stability, LLM-105/Al=65/30 is more stable than TATB/HMX/Al=50/15/30, but both of them are inferior to TATB/Al=70/25. The impact sensitivity of the two new explosives is higher than that of TATB/Al=70/25, and all of the samples are insensitive to friction. For detonation performance, both of the two new samples are superior to TATB/Al=70/25, and LLM-105/Al=65/30 exhibits the best performance that it has the highest Gurney energy, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure.

2-s2.0-85101324059,"The detection and identification of dangerous substances including narcotics or explosives remain a major challenge for customs agencies. In this context, a range of natural and modified Ligand Binding Proteins (LBPs) belonging to the families of Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs) and Major Urinary Proteins (MUPs) were selected and integrated on to nanodiamond coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers. An array of sensors was created, targeting the detection of explosives and illegal drugs with high sensitivity and selectivity, based on the ligand binding affinities of these compounds to the protein binding pockets. The affinity constant of 14 LBPs toward 19 chemical targets was initially assessed in aqueous solution by competitive binding assay using fluorescence probe N-phenylnaphthalen-1-amine (1-NPN) for insect OBPs and MUPs and 1-aminoanthracene (1-AMA) for porcine OBPs. The sensing performances of SAW transducers grafted with selected proteins were then investigated in the vapor phase and their sensitivities compared to the ligand binding behavior of the LBPs in liquid. A linear response in the concentration range from ppb to low ppm values was observed for all sensors. Some correlation between sensitivities in the vapor phase and affinity constants was observed for most proteins.

The measurable heat flow is the summarized effect of the rates of all the reaction heats of the reactions going on in the material. To get a detailed assessment instead the only global one requires knowing the heat flow parts caused by NC and by stabilizer reactions. For this, in turn, one needs to find the reaction enthalpies of the essential NC decomposition reactions and the stabilizer reactions at the temperature of the measurement of the heat flow. These data are not available in the literature. To get meaningful data it was necessary to use quantum mechanical calculations, here so-called DFT (density functional theory) methods, to screen the possible reactions by transition states and the energetic situation between educts and products. For the calculation of the reaction enthalpies and the transition states, the reactants were embedded in a polarizable continuum, which simulates the NC environment for the reactants in NC and for the stabilizer reactions. In addition, to calculate bond dissociation enthalpies of NC and of nitroglycerine a type of shell model was used called ONIOM (‘Our own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and molecular Mechanics’ model). The results from the determinations of reaction enthalpies are used in the second part of the publication. © 2021 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85103972458,"Surface sampling for trace explosives residues is a critical step in the security screening in which microparticles are collected for subsequent chemical analysis. The current surface swabbing approach suffers from limited sampling area coverage, uncertainty in harvesting efficiencies, and user bias. Non-contact sampling has received interest due to its ability to interrogate large surface areas without the redeposition of the collected sample. However, the aerodynamic liberation of energetic particles from different types of substrates has not been parameterized or directly compared with the contact sampling methods. Here, we report aerodynamic resuspension rates of TNT, RDX, and HMX microparticles from smooth, rough, and fibrous surfaces. The resuspension thresholds are correlated to the boundary layer properties, i.e., wall shear stresses (τw = 50–500Pa). These rates are then compared to contact sampling for five commercial swabs using a standardized swabbing method. LC-MS analysis is used for the quantification of particle removal efficiencies. Contact sampling has an advantage over the low shear stress cases for particle liberation from the smooth surfaces. Aerodynamic particle resuspension rates increase with the wall shear stress. It shows better results for rough and fibrous surfaces than contact removal for tested analytes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Kottapalli K., Novosselov I.V.",57204977685;6505491820;,"Aerodynamic resuspension and contact removal of energetic particles from smooth, rough, and fibrous surfaces",2021,Talanta,231,,122356,,,NA,12,10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122356,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103972458&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2021.122356&partnerID=40&md5=1f9aae19343455d84ce7ac827875d14e,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, 4000 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA  98195, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, MEB 309, 3900 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA  98195, United States","Kottapalli, K., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, 4000 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA  98195, United States; Novosselov, I.V., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, MEB 309, 3900 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA  98195, United States",Aerodynamic resuspension; Energetic particles residue; Non-contact sampling; Planar jet; Trace explosives; Wall shear stress,Aerodynamics; Boundary layers; Chemical analysis; Efficiency; Explosives; Aerodynamic resuspension; Energetic particle residue; Energetic particles; Microparticles; Non-contact sampling; Planar jets; Re-suspension; Trace explosive; Wall shear stress; Wall-shear stress; Shear stress,"Novosselov, I.V.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, MEB 309, 3900 E Stevens Way NE, United States; email: ivn@uw.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85107145102,"Illegal drugs and the explosives are harmful chemicals that present both social and national security issues. Existing analytical instruments and methods for identifying these substances are constrained by sensitivity, speed, and portability because of inherent technical defects. Miniaturized photoionization ion trap mass spectrometry is suitable for rapid and on-site identification of illegal drugs and the explosives; however, tandem mass spectrometry and the fragment ions have not been fully investigated. In this article, the abundant fragments of 22 illegal drugs and seven explosives were analyzed successfully using resonance excitation with a miniaturized ion trap mass spectrometer constructed in our laboratory and coupled with flash-thermal-desorption acetone-assisted photoionization. The mass range of the rectilinear ion trap was optimized through experimental mapping of stability diagrams to decrease the effect of the low mass cut-off. The secular frequencies for resonance excitation were simulated and validated using the experimental results. The fragments of illegal drugs and explosives were investigated and imported into a database. By comparing the tandem mass spectrometry fragments and the created database, a seized analyte could be identified within 3 s using a single analysis. This work indicates that ion resonance excitation is an effective approach for rapid analysis of illegal drugs and explosives. Furthermore, combination of a miniaturized ion trap mass spectrometer and compound database is useful for the identification of unknown and known compounds in forensic screening applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Wang W., Xu F., Jin L., Ding C.-F.",58084017700;35212535800;57224167487;55653896800;,Rapid identification of illegal drugs and explosives using resonance excitation in miniaturized photoionization ion trap mass spectrometry,2021,International Journal of Mass Spectrometry,467,,116625,,,NA,11,10.1016/j.ijms.2021.116625,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107145102&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijms.2021.116625&partnerID=40&md5=a9196147aa0a9b7a3508b64e788c04ef,"Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Mass Spectrometry, School of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China","Wang, W., Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Mass Spectrometry, School of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China; Xu, F., Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Mass Spectrometry, School of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China; Jin, L., Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Mass Spectrometry, School of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China; Ding, C.-F., Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Mass Spectrometry, School of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China",Axsim; Explosive; Illegal drug; Ion trap mass spectrometry; On-site analysis; Resonance excitation,,"Ding, C.-F.; Key Laboratory of Advanced Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Analysis of Zhejiang Province, China; email: dingchuanfan@nbu.edu.cn

Load, assembly and packing (LAP) facilities that process munitions produce wastewater contaminated with IHE which must be treated before discharge. Some facilities can produce as much as 90,000 L of contaminated wastewater per day. In this review, methods of wastewater treatment are assessed in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for their use in production of IHE munitions including their limitations and how they could be applied to industrial scale LAP facilities. Adsorption is identified as a suitable treatment method, however the high solubility of NTO, up to 16.6 g.L−1 which is 180 times higher that of TNT, has the potential to exceed the adsorptive capacity of carbon adsorption systems.

2-s2.0-85104639792,"The fabrication and optimization of cost-effective, eco-friendly, uniform and flexible SERS platforms by facile synthesis routes has recently attracted great attention for trace detection of various analytes. Herein, we report the fabrication of interconnected Ag nanostructures on the unmodified filter paper-based flexible substrates by a facile recipe, which involves evaporation of Ag precursor solution on the filter paper followed by its reduction with a strong reducing agent, NaBH4. The fabrication process is time-efficient, reproducible, and has the potential of being scaled up. The presence of inter-connected nanostructures results in high concentration of uniformly distributed hotspots on the substrate, which in turn provide excellent and reproducible SERS sensitivity. The finite element simulation results showed that fabricated nanostructures are much more effective for field enhancement as compared to the agglomerated spherical nanoparticles. Crystal violet (CV) concentration of 10−8 M was easily detected with these substrates both via solution drying and swabbing. Similarly, AgFPS have proven effective for swab-based detection of urea nitrate (UN), a well-known constituent of homemade explosives. The C-N and NO3- symmetric stretching modes of UN are detectable down to 1 µM and 100 µM concentrations, respectively. Moreover, these substrates showed SERS signal uniformity both from different spots of a single substrate, and substrates from different batches, with spot-to-spot relative standard deviation (RSD) of 15% and sample-to-sample RSD of 15–19%. This makes them excellent for reliable and quick quantitative detection. The simple synthesis strategy, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and quantitative detection makes these substrates ideal for SERS based trace detection, especially for on-site analysis, and various sensing applications. © 2021","Khan G.A., Demirtaş Ö., Demir A.K., Aytekin Ö., Bek A., Bhatti A.S., Ahmed W.",57202094144;57218925682;57220120976;8964614400;6602813700;7101882038;35298697600;,"Fabrication of flexible, cost-effective, and scalable silver substrates for efficient surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy based trace detection",2021,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,619,,126542,,,NA,16,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.126542,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104639792&doi=10.1016%2fj.colsurfa.2021.126542&partnerID=40&md5=556be7736d8d8904238358e5fb131799,"Materials Laboratory, Department of Physics, COMSATS University, Park Road, Islamabad, 45500, Pakistan; Micro and Nanotechnology Program, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, 06800, Turkey; Physics Department, I.D.

2-s2.0-85099806765,"The spheroidization of explosives with micro/nano hierarchical structure is a feasible and efficient way to meet the requirements of energy and safety. In order to achieve the expectation, a microfluidic strategy consisting of a spheroidization model and verification experiments was proposed. The model states a possible spheroidization process and three spheroidization types by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, a continuous microfluidic platform was established for the verification experiments, which is consisting of a combinatorial microfluidic module and a spray-drying module. Here we used HNS (2,2′,4,4′,6,6′hexanitrostilbene) to verify the applicability of the strategy. The spheroidization process was verified by deconstructing HNS microspheres and adjusting the internal-outside pressure at the microscale. The spheroidization types were verified by tuning flow rate ratios of the solvent and antisolvent. It was found that the model is quite applicable for the spheroidization of micro/nano hierarchical structure by microfluidics. According to the detonation test, it was found the HNS microspheres have similar firing sensitivity to nano HNS under short-pulse shock wave, which means the better fluidity and higher bulk density can be realized while retaining the firing sensitivity. This study demonstrates an efficient, safe strategy to realize the high-quality spheroidization and continuous preparation of explosives with micro/nano hierarchical structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Shi J., Zhu P., Zhao S., Xu C., Yan F., Shen R., Xia H., Jiang H., Xu S., Zhao F.",57211033656;12781408400;57201348698;57195999548;57201351751;7202935837;56015777300;55017680500;14016934300;36041628300;,Continuous spheroidization strategy for explosives with micro/nano hierarchical structure by coupling microfluidics and spray drying,2021,Chemical Engineering Journal,412,,128613,,,NA,33,10.1016/j.cej.2021.128613,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099806765&doi=10.1016%2fj.cej.2021.128613&partnerID=40&md5=dbb720f1134659c7b558197b0301f567,"School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Shaanxi Xi'an, 710065, China","Shi, J., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Zhu, P., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Zhao, S., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Xu, C., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Yan, F., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Shen, R., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Xia, H., School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Jiang, H., Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Shaanxi Xi'an, 710065, China; Xu, S., Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Shaanxi Xi'an, 710065, China; Zhao, F., Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Shaanxi Xi'an, 710065, China",Continuous preparation; Hexanitrostilbene; Micro/nano hierarchical structure; Microfluidics; Spheroidization,Explosives; Microspheres; Shock waves; Spray drying; Ultrafast lasers; Anti-solvents; Bulk density; Flowrate ratio; Hierarchical structures; High quality; Microfluidic platforms; Modeling and verifications; Spheroidization; Microfluidics,"Zhu, P.; School of Chemical Engineering, China; email: zhupeng@njust.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Herein, we present a new approach for the “on-off-on” sensing of Hg2+and triacetone triperoxide (TATP) based on amphiphilic polythiophene-coated CdTe QDs (PQDs, PLQY ∼78%). The emission of the PQDs is quenched by Hg2+ionsviaelectron transfer interactions. Based on the strong interaction between TATP and Hg2+ions, the addition of TATP to the PQD-Hg2+complex results in a remarkable recovery of the PQD emission. Under the optimized conditions, the PQD sensor shows a good linear response to Hg2+and TATP with detection limits of 7.4 nM and 0.055 mg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, the “on-off-on” sensor demonstrates good biocompatibility, high stability, and excellent selectivity in the presence of other metal ions and common explosives. Importantly, the proposed method can be used to determine the level of Hg2+and TATP in environmental water samples. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Tawfik S.M., Abd-Elaal A.A., Lee Y.-I.",59000134900;39761175400;8056002100;,Selective dual detection of Hg2+and TATP based on amphiphilic conjugated polythiophene-quantum dot hybrid materials,2021,Analyst,146,9,,2894,2901,NA,14,10.1039/d1an00166c,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105404917&doi=10.1039%2fd1an00166c&partnerID=40&md5=8dd7829a5959241a5f5d8385b7ed03fc,"Department of Petrochemicals, Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute, Cairo, 11727, Egypt; Department of Materials Convergence and System Engineering, Changwon National University, Changwon, 51140, South Korea","Tawfik, S.M., Department of Petrochemicals, Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute, Cairo, 11727, Egypt; Abd-Elaal, A.A., Department of Petrochemicals, Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute, Cairo, 11727, Egypt; Lee, Y.-I., Department of Materials Convergence and System Engineering, Changwon National University, Changwon, 51140, South Korea",,Biocompatibility; Cadmium telluride; Environmental technology; II-VI semiconductors; Mercury compounds; Metal ions; Metals; Nanocrystals; Organic polymers; Semiconductor quantum dots; Amphiphilic polythiophene; Environmental pollutants; Environmental water samples; Monitoring technologies; Multifunctional sensors; Optimized conditions; Strong interaction; Triacetone triperoxide; Hybrid materials,"Lee, Y.-I.; Department of Materials Convergence and System Engineering, South Korea; email: yilee@changwon.ac.kr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85118585255,"The detection of reactive compounds represents a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate that heteronanotubes formed by covalently bonded carbon (CNT) and boron nitride (BN) nanotubes can be used to selectively sense trinitrotoluene (TNT) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP). We show that the energy band gap can be created and tuned in carbon/boron nitride (C/BN) heteronanotubes. Once TNT or TATP is physisorbed on C/BN heteronanotubes, new resonances are formed within the energy gap of heteronanotubes. Crucially, transport resonances associated with TNT are formed above the Fermi level and are due to nitro group whereas TATP resonances happen to be below the Fermi level. Consequently, a negative Seebeck coefficient is expected for C/BN heteronanotubes devices in the presence of TNT in contrast to a positive Seebeck coefficient in the presence of TATP. This can be used for selective sensing of these species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Algharagholy L.A., Sadeghi H., Al-Backri A.A.",55337912700;57196916799;56071559500;,"Selective sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and triacetone triperoxide using carbon/boron nitride heteronanotubes",2021,Materials Today Communications,28,,102739,,,NA,10,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2021.102739,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118585255&doi=10.1016%2fj.mtcomm.2021.102739&partnerID=40&md5=c68bdf4da30c71b76a9d2c7611b862e8,"Department of Physics, College of Science, University of Sumer, Al Rifaee, Thi-Qar, 64005, Iraq; Device Modelling Group, School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom; Department of Astronomy and space, College of Science, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq","Algharagholy, L.A., Department of Physics, College of Science, University of Sumer, Al Rifaee, Thi-Qar, 64005, Iraq; Sadeghi, H., Device Modelling Group, School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom; Al-Backri, A.A., Department of Astronomy and space, College of Science, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq",Boron nitride; Carbon nanotubes; Heteronanotubes; Nanoelectronics; Nanosensors; Thermoelectric,Boron nitride; Energy gap; Fermi level; III-V semiconductors; Nanosensors; Nitrides; Resonance; Seebeck coefficient; Boron nitride nanotubes; Covalently bonded; Energy; Energy bandgaps; Heteronanotube; Nitro group; Physisorbed; Selective sensing; Thermoelectric; Triacetone triperoxide; Carbon nanotubes,"Algharagholy, L.A.; Department of Physics, Al Rifaee, Iraq; email: l.algharagholy@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85104689534,"This work aims to investigate the aging behavior related to heat of a pyrotechnic tracer composition (PTC) sample composed of strontium nitrate as an oxidizer and dual-fuel of Mg and Mg−Al alloy. Fresh and thermally aged samples were examined using nondestructive spectroscopic techniques, namely Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The obtained results showed that aging for 20, 40, and 60 days at 65 °C does not provoke noticeable chemical or structural changes, whereas, after 60 days, the changes are visible, and become more obvious after aging for 120 days. These changes are caused by the partial decomposition of strontium nitrate and the oxidation of magnesium, which are followed by the generation of degradation products such as Sr(NO2)2, MgO, and Mg(OH)2. On the other hand, the applicability of FTIR and XRD associated with a chemometric tool, the principal component analysis, as a simple and useful technique has been also assessed to discriminate the spectra of the aged samples. It has been revealed that these combined approaches can be effectively used to recognize the main compositional and structural changes within the pyrotechnic tracer composition affected by the thermal degradation process. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Bekhouche S., Trache D., Chelouche S., Abdelaziz A., Tarchoun A.F., Benchaa W., Benameur S., Mezroua A.",6506454923;55008987800;57202815717;57195771155;57195423540;57223086424;57223086434;8098920900;,Investigation of the Thermal Aging Behavior of Pyrotechnic Tracer Composition by Spectroscopic Techniques Coupled with Principal Component Analysis,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,7,,1155,1166,NA,11,10.1002/prep.202100019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104689534&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202100019&partnerID=40&md5=bfef9c514de05b7820a8c78eaecd4c40,"Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Energetic Propulsion Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria","Bekhouche, S., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Trache, D., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Chelouche, S., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Abdelaziz, A., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Tarchoun, A.F., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria, Energetic Propulsion Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Benchaa, W., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Benameur, S., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Mezroua, A., Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research unit of Energetic Processes, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria",Accelerated aging; FTIR; PCA; Pyrotechnic tracer composition; Raman; XRD,Aluminum alloys; Data handling; Degradation; Magnesia; Nitrates; Oxide minerals; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectroscopic analysis; Strontium compounds; Thermal aging; Tracers; X ray diffraction; Aging behavior; Chemometric tools; Degradation products; Dual-fuels; Non destructive; Partial decomposition; Spectroscopic technique; Strontium nitrate; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"Trache, D.; Energetic Materials Laboratory, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algeria; email: djalaltrache@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The use of 15.7 wt.% the mixed UFP based on Al/B, Ti/B, Ni/B or Fe/B in HEM reduces the ignition delay time by 7–50 % compared to boron-based HEM in the range of heat flux density from 60 to 200 W/cm2. Based on experimental data of the ignition delay time versus the heat flux density, the formal activation energy, the multiplication of the specific heat flux of the reactions by the pre-exponent and the ignition temperature are calculated which could be used in mathematical modeling of the ignition for composite solid propellant containing metal fuels. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Korotkikh A.G., Sorokin I.V.",6507504101;57190948404;,Effect of Me/B-Powder on the Ignition of High-Energy Materials,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,11,,1709,1716,NA,13,10.1002/prep.202100180,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115675954&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202100180&partnerID=40&md5=f3919a420ff3627fc0ea64b9edd08f51,"National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Lenin Ave. 30, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation; National Research Tomsk State University, Lenin Ave. 36, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation","Korotkikh, A.G., National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Lenin Ave. 30, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation, National Research Tomsk State University, Lenin Ave. 36, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation; Sorokin, I.V., National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Lenin Ave. 30, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation",Activation energy; Aluminum; Boron; High-energy material; Ignition temperature; Iron; Nickel; Titanium,Activation energy; Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Data handling; Ignition; Iron compounds; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Specific heat; Thermoanalysis; Titanium; Explosion safeties; Heat flux densities; High energy materials; Ignition characteristics; Ignition delay time; Ignition temperatures; Oxidation temperature; Powder-based; Practical problems; Ultrafine powders; Iron,"Korotkikh, A.G.; National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Lenin Ave. 30, Russian Federation; email: korotkikh@tpu.ru

2-s2.0-85100773149,"A thermite reaction is a self-propagating exothermic reaction with many practical applications in welding processes, material synthesis, pyrotechnic and initiator technologies. Motivated by the above-mentioned, the present study involves modeling and simulation of common hematite-aluminum thermite reaction with the aim of predicting temperature levels and radial burning speeds in a thin disk ignited at the center. Balance equations of species and energy conservation were solved in one dimension space by applying a finite difference method, considering no species transport and a one-step mechanism. The Arrhenius equation was adopted to model the kinetics rate. Phase change and temperature dependence of the thermochemical properties were also considered. Analyses of spatial and temporal meshes revealed that numerical results were independent of the grid used. Predictions show that the ignition procedure affects the formation of the reaction-front, higher temperatures, and longer ignition zones can start the self-sustained reaction earlier. However, once the reaction wave is established, its velocity and peak temperature are the same, independent of the initial temperature profile. Simulations herein also show that an increase of the activation energy and decrease of the pre-exponential factor slows down the reaction speed considerably, impacting on accurate prediction of reaction-wave velocity. Further, the activation energy influences the burning velocity much more drastically than the pre-exponential factor. The maximum temperature observed in the model is around the melting temperature of alumina (2327 K), which is in agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","de Souza K.M., de Lemos M.J.S.",57214792234;7004984975;,Detailed Numerical Modeling and Simulation of Fe2O3−Al Thermite Reaction,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,5,,806,824,NA,21,10.1002/prep.202000290,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100773149&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000290&partnerID=40&md5=a26db5d8cd6bce222a8b81789ff249df,"Departamento de Energia – IEME, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica – ITA, São José dos Campos, SP  12228-900 –, Brazil","de Souza, K.M., Departamento de Energia – IEME, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica – ITA, São José dos Campos, SP  12228-900 –, Brazil; de Lemos, M.J.S., Departamento de Energia – IEME, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica – ITA, São José dos Campos, SP  12228-900 –, Brazil",Aluminothermic Reaction; Finite-Difference-Scheme; Hematite-Aluminum Reaction; Thermite,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Conservation; Finite difference method; Forecasting; Hematite; Microgrids; Temperature distribution; Wave propagation; Initial temperatures; Maximum temperature; Model and simulation; Preexponential factor; Self-propagating exothermic reactions; Self-sustained reactions; Temperature dependence; Thermochemical properties; Activation energy,"de Lemos, M.J.S.; Departamento de Energia – IEME, Brazil; email: delemos@ita.br",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85111033510,"Fatalities and injuries are mainly attributed to primary fragmentation if accidental or malevolent detonation of high-explosive munitions occurs in an open space. This study aims to develop a simulation-based approach to assess individual casualty risks from primary fragments naturally generated by detonation of high-explosive munitions, which enables a stochastic characterization of fragment generation, trajectories, modelling uncertainties, and human vulnerability. The proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example estimating the fatality and injury risks for an individual in a standing position exposed to the detonation of a single 105 mm projectile. The results suggest that, as expected, the individual fatality and injury risks decrease with an increasing stand-off distance. At a stand-off distance greater than 40 m, an individual is more likely to suffer injuries rather than fatality.

2-s2.0-85107779948,"Detection of explosives at trace levels is crucial for security purposes because of increasing worldwide terrorist threats at public places. Previously, a hollow cathode discharge (HCD) ion source has been fabricated for detection of explosives. Recently, the HCD ion source has been modified for a dual pressures operating system and coupled to a linear ion trap MS to analyze explosives simultaneously. Here, trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerin (NG), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were taken as model explosive compounds and the mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode ionization. At the higher ion source pressure (~28.0–30.0 Torr), NG, PETN and RDX gave adduct ions with the NO3− ion while TNT showed the [TNT + NO3–HNO2]- (m/z 242) simultaneously. However, NG and PETN did not give any ion signals at the lower ion source pressure (~0.8–1.0 Torr) while TNT exhibited its molecular ion, [TNT]-• (m/z 227), as a major ion through electron attachment and RDX showed fragment ions that followed electron capture dissociation concurrently. The modified HCD ion source exhibited better sensitivity in simultaneous detection and quantification of the explosives. The NO3− and NO2− as reagent ions in the air HCD plasma form stable adduct ions with the NG, PETN and RDX even with TNT at the higher temperature (140–200 °C). The formation of the NO3−, NO2− in the HCD plasma also causes the formation of [TNT-H]- (m/z 226) at the higher ion source pressure. The inner metallic surface of the hollow tube assists the Birch reduction type reaction that results in the formation of hydride ion of the TNT, [TNT + H]- (m/z 228). No significant difference in the spectral pattern for simultaneous and individual measurements for the explosives was observed at the higher ion source pressure. Therefore, it may conclude that the present modified HCD ion source can be used for simultaneous detection and quantification of the explosive compounds at trace and/or ultra-trace levels using air as a carrier gas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Habib A., Bi L., Wen L.",55925347000;57201682634;57189490873;,Simultaneous detection and quantification of explosives by a modified hollow cathode discharge ion source,2021,Talanta,233,,122596,,,NA,8,10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122596,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107779948&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2021.122596&partnerID=40&md5=7777bd62a45b1d3e33a761cc456fedb5,"The Research Institute of Advanced Technologies, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315211, China; China Innovation Instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315000, China; Department of Chemistry, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, 1000, Bangladesh","Habib, A., The Research Institute of Advanced Technologies, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315211, China, Department of Chemistry, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, 1000, Bangladesh; Bi, L., The Research Institute of Advanced Technologies, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315211, China, China Innovation Instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315000, China; Wen, L., The Research Institute of Advanced Technologies, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315211, China, China Innovation Instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, Zhejiang  315000, China",Adduct ions; Birch reduction type reaction; Explosives; Modified HCD ion Source; Simultaneous detection,Cathodes; Dissociation; Explosives detection; Ion sources; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen oxides; Adduct ion; Birch reduction type reaction; Detection and quantifications; Detection of explosives; Explosive compounds; Hollow cathode discharge; Modified hollow cathode discharge ion source; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; Simultaneous detection; Source pressure; Explosives; explosive; pentaerythrityl tetranitrate; trinitrotoluene; electrode; hospital discharge; human; Electrodes; Explosive Agents; Humans; Patient Discharge; Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate; Trinitrotoluene,"Habib, A.; The Research Institute of Advanced Technologies, China; email: habibchem@du.ac.bd

2-s2.0-85107757481,"Real-time measurements of the product gases arising from the thermal decomposition of triamino-trinitro benzene (TATB), its deuterated analogue, and plastically bonded TATB (LX-17) are presented in this study. Gas-phase decomposition products are identified by IR absorption spectroscopy. The frequency shifts in rovibrational spectra due to isotopic substitution and the change in rate of formation of decomposition products due to the kinetic-isotope-effect (KIE) help elucidate the decomposition pathways. The formation of H2O precedes other molecules (e. g., HCN, HNCO) during decomposition. After the concentrations of HCN and HNCO molecules reach a peak, their amounts gradually decrease. The concentrations of the other decomposition products (e. g., NH3 and CO2) rapidly rise after an induction period, which is attributed to the presence of autocatalytic reactions. The trends of chemical evolution are similar for all the samples, but their kinetic behaviors are different. This indicates the rates of consistent pathways are changed during thermal decomposition. The kinetics of deuterated TATB decomposition is slower than that of unsubstituted TATB due to the KIE (kH/kD∼1.41). The rate of LX-17 decomposition is slightly lower than unsubstituted TATB (kTATB/kLX-17∼1.15). The KIE is more pronounced during the early stage of decomposition, which is attributed to the first steps of TATB decomposition involving water formation (i. e., H vs D transfer). The KIE slows down the formation of all gases, including those lacking hydrogen (e. g., CO2). These results suggest the TATB thermal decomposition mechanism might involve a series of pathways rather than a set of independent and parallel reactions. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Koroglu B., Crowhurst J.C., Kahl E.M., Moore J.S., Racoveanu A., Mason H.E., Weisz D.G., Reynolds J.G., Burnham A.K.",55261413500;7004134530;57202912858;57219990997;15036877700;15725649400;57526783500;57216597918;7005464658;,Experimental Investigation of the Thermal Decomposition Pathways and Kinetics of TATB by Isotopic Substitution,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,9,,1352,1366,NA,12,10.1002/prep.202100082,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107757481&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202100082&partnerID=40&md5=3d41867d13f2d9fdf1fa661b36d55fd1,"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; M.H.

2-s2.0-85108699838,"Sensing explosive taggants such as 3-nitrotoluene (3-NT) and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane has become a strategic priority in homeland security. This work reports the synthesis of a solid-state plasmonic sensor based on a nanocomposite of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective detection of 3-NT, an explosive taggant for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. In our approach, the in situ synthesis of Ag NPs and the molecular imprinting with 3-NT as a template take place simultaneously inside the polyethyleneimine (PEI) thin film during the baking step after spin coating. The MIP sensor fabrication is done by a low-cost, fast, and scalable one-step procedure. We demonstrate the chemosensing capabilities of Ag-PEI MIP nanocomposites to 3-NT using the localized surface plasmon resonance band intensity decay as a sensing parameter. The molecular imprinting approach results in an enhancement of specific sensor response to 3-NT, with a limit of detection of 54.8 ng for 3-NT and a sensitivity of 24.0% ± 3.0%. We tested the MIP sensor specificity by comparing the sensor response to several NO2-containing molecules. The Ag-PEI MIP sensor demonstrated a robust, specific molecular recognition toward 3-NT. Because the MIP nanocomposite sensor is easy to prepare, easy to use, and inexpensive, these plasmonic sensors can be easily implemented with portable reading platforms into remote explosive detection and bomb disposal robots.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

2-s2.0-85105411582,"Abstract: Landmines and other explosive remnants of war pose a global humanitarian problem that claims numerous casualties long after the conflict has ended. As there are no acceptable methodologies for the remote discovery of such devices, current detection practices still require the risky presence of personnel in the minefield. We have recently described bacterial sensor strains capable of reporting the existence of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) vapors in the soil above 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-based landmines, by generating a bioluminescent or a fluorescent signal. This may allow the identification of landmine location by remote imaging of an area over which the bacteria have been spread. In the study reported herein, we have improved the DNT-detection capabilities of these sensor strains by combining two DNT-responsive Escherichia coli gene promoters, yqjF and azoR, and subjecting them to three cycles of random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, combined with segmentation and rearrangement (“DNA shuffling”). The activity of selected modified promoters was evaluated with the Aliivibrio fischeri and Photobacterium leiognathi luxCDABEG gene cassettes as the bioluminescent reporters, exhibiting a ten-fold background reduction that has led to a three-fold decrease in detection threshold. Signal intensity was further enhanced by modifying the ribosomal binding site of the yqjF gene promoter. The superior DNT detection capabilities on a solid matrix by the improved sensor strain were demonstrated. Key points: • Performance of microbial sensor strains for buried explosives was molecularly enhanced. • Manipulations included random mutagenesis, “DNA shuffling,” and RBS reprogramming. • The re-engineered constructs exhibited superior detection of trace explosives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Shpigel E., Shemer B., Elad T., Glozman A., Belkin S.",6506657567;56957092700;25651654500;57218295523;7006299966;,Bacterial bioreporters for the detection of trace explosives: performance enhancement by DNA shuffling and random mutagenesis,2021,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,105,10,,4329,4337,NA,12,10.1007/s00253-021-11290-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105411582&doi=10.1007%2fs00253-021-11290-2&partnerID=40&md5=5b052a8b7cec4ad3f26c94fa851c8cfe,"Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Shpigel, E., Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; Shemer, B., Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; Elad, T., Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; Glozman, A., Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; Belkin, S., Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT); 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (DNT); Biosensors; Explosives; Landmines; Microbial bioreporters","Bioluminescence; Bombs (ordnance); DNA; Escherichia coli; Explosives; Explosives detection; Genes; Mutagenesis; Polymerase chain reaction; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; 2 ,4-dinitrotoluene; Detection capability; Detection threshold; Fluorescent signals; Performance enhancements; Photobacterium leiognathi; Signal intensities; Landmine detection; 2,4 dinitrotoluene; explosive; trinitrotoluene; trinitrotoluene; bacterium; explosive; landmine; mutagenicity; performance assessment; Aliivibrio fischeri; Article; bacterial strain; binding site; bioluminescence; controlled study; DNA shuffling; error-prone polymerase chain reaction; Escherichia coli; fluorescence; gene cassette; landmine; nonhuman; Photobacterium leiognathi; promoter region; random mutagenesis; sequence alignment; soil; vapor; bacterium; DNA shuffling; genetic procedures; mutagenesis; Photobacterium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Photobacterium leiognathi; Bacteria; Biosensing Techniques; DNA Shuffling; Explosive Agents; Mutagenesis; Photobacterium; Trinitrotoluene","Belkin, S.; Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, Israel; email: shimshon.belkin@mail.huji.ac.il",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85108019571,"The evergrowing demand for cleaner, high-performing energetic materials (EMs) has led to a quest for replacement of currently used toxic metal-based traditional energetic compounds such as lead azide and lead styphnate. As such, significant effort has been placed on the implementation of nitrogen-rich frameworks as cleaner and safer alternatives to the environmentally harmful EMs. This review examines strategies for the design and synthesis of next-generation nitrogen-rich, “green” primary explosives. Three categories of this class of materials are examined, namely potassium-based energetic salts, metal-free ionic energetic salts and metal-free covalent energetic materials. Within each subsection, different combinations of nitrogen-rich frameworks and energetic substituents are highlighted in terms of their explosive performance, initiability, safety and environmental impact.

2-s2.0-85107822545,"On August 4 in Beirut Port, Lebanon, a catastrophic explosion occurred at a warehouse, claiming 204 deaths and injured more than 7000 individuals, with a property loss of approximately US$ 15 billion. An extensive consequence analysis based on the crater size and physical effects for the estimation of the quantity of exploded ammonium nitrate was performed. By using satellite images and integration methods, the crater diameter was determined to be 112.9 m. From the scaling laws, overpressure effect on structures, and inverse analysis, the trinitrotoluene equivalent mass of exploded ammonium nitrate was approximately 950.3 tons. Based on the results of the consequence analysis performed by three methodologies, it can be concluded that the warehouse not only stored a substantially large quantity of ammonium nitrate but was also located too close to the adjacent communities and residential districts without an adequate safety distance. Judging by the simulation results of overpressures and explosive blast on structures, a fatality radius is determined to be about 487 m from the explosion center. Some more lessons related to the time to explosion, phenomena of sympathetic detonation, arrival time of blast, safety distance, fatalities/injuries versus the equivalent mass of trinitrotoluene and a maximum allowable quantity of 30 tons have been learned to be the important guides for safety measures and revisions for limiting the amount of ammonium nitrate under storage. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Yu G., Wang Y., Zheng L., Huang J., Li J., Gong L., Chen R., Li W., Huang J., Duh Y.-S.",57189214402;57190428655;57224504042;13103983200;36247317600;55596906400;57212405036;57224518937;57224502235;35611189200;,Comprehensive study on the catastrophic explosion of ammonium nitrate stored in the warehouse of Beirut port,2021,Process Safety and Environmental Protection,152,,,201,219,NA,27,10.1016/j.psep.2021.05.030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107822545&doi=10.1016%2fj.psep.2021.05.030&partnerID=40&md5=e7096b1641f3eb8c6cfb46eebe72033c,"Institute of Chemical Safety, Simulation Center for Chemical Safety and Environmental Protection, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China; School of Teacher Education, Weifang University of Science and Technology, Weifang, Shandong, China; Fujian Huaxia Institute of Energy and Design Co.

2-s2.0-85107620972,"A mid infrared tunable Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) operating in the spectral region of 3000–3450 nm has been developed and its performance has been evaluated by measuring the vapors of diesel and acetone. Diesel, one of the hydrocarbon products has been used for calibration of the DIAL wavelengths. Transmittance spectrum of diesel has been measured in 3360–3390 nm wavelength band using this system. Further, these absorption lines have been validated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measured spectra. Acetone, one of the precursors employed in the manufacturing of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), is used in field experiments. Firstly, the transmittance spectra of acetone vapors in the glass cell is recorded in the spectral band 3250–3365 nm using this setup. Further, the spectra have been compared with the data reported by NIST. Based on the analysis, the wavelengths at 3254 nm and 3362 nm have been chosen as offline and online wavelengths respectively. For open field experiments, a test chamber made of transparent PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) material with openable windows on both sides placed at standoff distance of 100 m has been used. Standoff measurements have been carried out by keeping the chamber closed as well as open conditions. The average column content of acetone vapors has been measured for closed and open chamber conditions. During open chamber condition, the maximum concentration of about 13180 ppm.m has been measured. The average minimum concentration of about 30 ppm.m was observed during final dispersion stages. The influence of the atmospheric interfering molecules in the measurement wavelengths have also been analyzed and quantified their contribution in the return signals. The total contribution of these molecules in the return signal is about 0.3% at online wavelength whereas this is about 0.13% at offline wavelength. © 2021","Jindal M.K., Veerabuthiran S., Mainuddin, Razdan A.K.",55696190600;15840990200;56490843400;7006711121;,Integrated path DIAL for standoff detection of acetone vapors under topographic target condition,2021,Optics and Laser Technology,143,,107299,,,NA,9,10.1016/j.optlastec.2021.107299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107620972&doi=10.1016%2fj.optlastec.2021.107299&partnerID=40&md5=ab2bf0a6831ae6973d68a236feccacfe,"Laser Science & Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, India; Deptt. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, JMIDelhi, India","Jindal, M.K., Laser Science & Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, India; Veerabuthiran, S., Laser Science & Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, India; Mainuddin, Deptt. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, JMIDelhi, India; Razdan, A.K., Laser Science & Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, India",Acetone detection; DIAL; LIDAR; Remote detection,Dichloromethane; Explosives; Explosives detection; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molecules; Optical radar; Polymethyl methacrylates; Acetone detection; Acetone vapors; Chamber condition; Differential absorptions lidars; Field experiment; Offline; Remote detection; Return signals; Spectra's; Transmittance spectra; Acetone,"Veerabuthiran, S.; Laser Science & Technology Centre, India; email: sveerabutriran@lastec.drdo.in",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85101988277,"Heterocyclic skeleton (Azoles) and different energetic groups containing high performing explosives are highly emerged in recent years to meet the challenging requirements of energetic materials in both military and civilian applications with improved performance. For this purpose tetrazole (Azole) is identified as an attractive heterocyclic backbone with energetic functional groups nitro (-NO2), nitrato (-ONO2), nitrimino (-NNO2), and nitramino (–NH–NO2) to replace the traditionally used high performing explosives. The tetrazole based compounds having these energetic functional groups demonstrated advanced energetic performance (detonation velocity and pressure), densities, and heat of formation (HOF) and became a potential replacement of traditional energetic compounds such as RDX.

2-s2.0-85088564793,"Mass spectrometry is commonly used in forensic chemistry laboratories for sensitive, definitive analysis. There have been significant efforts to bring mass spectrometry analysis on-site through the development of ruggedized, fieldable instruments. Testing samples in the field is of particular interest in forensic science, homeland security, and defense applications. In forensic chemistry, testing seized drugs in the field can significantly improve efficiencies in processing of related criminal cases. The screening of passengers and luggage at transportation hubs is a critical need for homeland security for which mass spectrometry is well suited to provide definitive answers with low false positive rates. Mass spectrometry can yield reliable data for military personnel testing sites for potential chemical weapons release. To meet the needs of the forensic and security communities fieldable mass spectrometers based on membrane inlet systems and hybrid gas chromatography systems have been developed and commercialized. More recently developed ambient ionization mass spectrometry methods can eliminate the time, equipment, and expertise associated with sample preparation, and so are especially appealing for on-site analysis.

2-s2.0-85101097804,"Direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry (DART-MS) was used to explore the behavior of vapor released from triacetone triperoxide (TATP) versus an absorption-based canine training aid sometimes called a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer odor capture and release (POCR) system. The results compare dissipation from the source to the instrument (in minutes), steady state signal intensity (i.e. approximate relative amounts), and dissipation of the odor after removing the source (also in minutes). Several parameters were tested: reproducibility between POCRs, TATP versus TATP with a lid (containing 13 drilled holes), distance from the detector, heights of the source, concealment, purposeful air disturbances, blanks, and containment systems. In general, the PDMS-based training aid behaved similarly to the TATP with a 13-hole lid, which is the aid most often used by the FBI's National Canine Improvised Explosives Detection Program. Results shows that the PDMS-based training aids are reproducible and reliable at steady state as a vapor release system. As expected, signal was decreased given increased distance from the DART interface for all sample types, when using the odor-restricting lid with the 1 g TATP sample, when all samples were placed at height, and when using a cotton bag as a method of concealment. Despite having no direct correlation, these results support anecdotal canine evidence since canine handlers tend to report that their dogs have more difficulty finding training aids within those same parameters. Further, adding purposeful air disturbances had a larger effect on signal intensity for 1 g TATP than on the PDMS-based training aid. Finally, adding a masking odor at the DART interface decreased detection of TATP regardless of the vapor source, but did not fully diminish it. This too agrees with canine handler reports and previous research, where dogs may have a more difficult time locating odors in the presence of high background. This is the first report of its kind to use real-time detection to characterize vapor release and dissipation from a biosensor training aid in comparison to the corresponding true material it intends to replace. By using the three phases of odor release (saturation, steady state, and depletion), the study investigates the effects of several ambient parameters on TATP volatile detection from true material and the PDMS-based training aid. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Simon A.G., Van Arsdale K., Barrow J., Wagner J.",57193125827;57217294326;57217291215;57199776796;,Real-time monitoring of TATP released from PDMS-based canine training aids versus bulk TATP using DART-MS,2021,Forensic Chemistry,23,,100315,,,NA,14,10.1016/j.forc.2021.100315,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101097804&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2021.100315&partnerID=40&md5=e9c0ac4f99e8b8a7a1e21f3b6cf08c65,"School of Forensic Sciences, Oklahoma State University – Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, OK, United States; Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory Division, Quantico, VA, United States","Simon, A.G., School of Forensic Sciences, Oklahoma State University – Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, OK, United States; Van Arsdale, K., Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory Division, Quantico, VA, United States; Barrow, J., School of Forensic Sciences, Oklahoma State University – Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, OK, United States, Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory Division, Quantico, VA, United States; Wagner, J., School of Forensic Sciences, Oklahoma State University – Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, OK, United States",Canine training aid; DART-MS; PDMS; TATP; Vapor detection,,"Simon, A.G.; School of Forensic Sciences, United States; email: alison.simon@okstate.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85114692864,"The components in polymer-bonded explosive X, including cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine, paraffin, and polytetrafluoroethylene, were determined using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Using partial least squares as the multivariate calibration method, quantitative calibration models for components in X were verified internally and externally. The possible combinations of eight general spectral pretreatment methods and different bands of the scanning spectral region (12,500-4000 cm-1) were established. The models were analyzed, evaluated, and optimized via the fitting effect. The data were combined with the mathematical meaning of the model spectral pretreatment methods and the chemical significance of the modeling spectral bands. Prediction performance offered optimal quantitative calibration models.

2-s2.0-85109829318,"In the wake of the development of micro-initiation systems, traditional lead-based primary explosives hardly satisfy the needs of high energy output. Copper azide (CA), one of the most promising primary explosives, is restricted in practical applications because of its high electrostatic sensitivity and the method of charge in micro-initiation systems. To tackle these issues, two synthetic paths of CA based on a porous graphene skeleton are proposed. First, a viscous homogeneous mixed solution is rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen to form a spherical copper-containing precursor material. The copper azide/carbon/graphene composite (CA/C/GA) was fabricated by freeze-drying, high-temperature thermal decomposition and in situ azidation. Second, A cylindrical copper/graphene gel formed by high-temperature hydrothermal self-assembly is served as a precursor material. Also, hydrogen reduction and in situ azidation procedures were utilized to synthesize copper azide@graphene foam (CA@GF). Detailed characterization indicates that the excellent performance of composite materials is ascribed to the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene material. The electrostatic sensitivities of CA/C/GA and CA@GF were 3.6 mJ and 2.5 mJ, respectively, and the flame sensitivity was 50 cm. The course of fabrication is environmentally friendly and easy to perform and it may be well-matched with the charge of the micro-detonation system.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Yan Z., Yang L., Han J.-M., Li H.",57202544251;57004031600;57200224272;57223166613;,Molding fabrication of copper azide/porous graphene with high electrostatic safety by self-assembly of graphene oxide,2021,Nanotechnology,32,38,385704,,,NA,13,10.1088/1361-6528/abc7d5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109829318&doi=10.1088%2f1361-6528%2fabc7d5&partnerID=40&md5=88de424993c34f31ce37fa5703390452,"State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China","Yan, Z., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Yang, L., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Han, J.-M., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Li, H., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China",electrostatic sensitivity; energetic material; micro-initiators; nanoscale copper azide; porous grapheme,Decomposition; Electrostatics; Explosives; Fabrication; Graphene; Green manufacturing; Initiators (explosives); Liquefied gases; Self assembly; Thermal conductivity; Electrostatic sensitivity; High temperature; High-energy output; Hydrogen reduction; Initiation system; Porous graphene; Precursor materials; Primary explosive; Copper compounds,"Yang, L.; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, China; email: yanglibit@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85110954752,"Recently, a burgeoning category of biocompatible botanically derived nanomaterial cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) has captured tremendous attention on account of its entangled nanostructured network, natural abundance, and outstanding mechanical properties. Biomimetically inspired by the superior properties of CNFs, this paper examined them as the coating material to cover cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) via a facile water suspension method and the ultrasonic technology. The core-shell structure and the composition of energetic crystal@CNF were examined through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The obtained outcomes demonstrated that the dispersibility of the CNF enhanced favorably upon covering the surface of explosive crystals; the interfacial contact ability between CNFs and energetic crystals was also manifested to be increased, which could be ascribed to the interfacial interaction of hydrogen bonds and the electrostatic force of self-assembly. In addition, the stable crystalloid construction of β-HMX and ϵ-CL-20 has been preserved positively in the preparation process. In comparison with raw explosives, the thermal stability and sensitivity performances of the core-shell structure composites were outstanding. Accordingly, this work demonstrated the rewarding application of coating CNFs uniformly on the surface of energetic crystals, ulteriorly offering a potential fabrication strategy for the embellishment of high-explosive crystals.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Chen L., Cao X., Chen Y., Li Q., Wang Y., Wang X., Qin Y., Cao X., Liu J., Shao Z., He W.",57220860411;57222170433;57226250027;58599666900;57208535430;57226258981;57222658805;57226252996;56101451000;7202244452;56549312200;,Biomimetic-Inspired One-Step Strategy for Improvement of Interfacial Interactions in Cellulose Nanofibers by Modification of the Surface of Nitramine Explosives,2021,Langmuir,37,28,,8486,8497,NA,16,10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00874,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110954752&doi=10.1021%2facs.langmuir.1c00874&partnerID=40&md5=d85a410f84ccd97a704e3db17fee8c43,"Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Inner Mongolia Synthetic Chemical and Engineering Institute, Hohhot, 010010, China; Institute of Chemical Defence, Academy of Military Sciences, Hubei, Zhijiang, 443200, China; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China","Chen, L., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Cao, X., Inner Mongolia Synthetic Chemical and Engineering Institute, Hohhot, 010010, China; Chen, Y., Institute of Chemical Defence, Academy of Military Sciences, Hubei, Zhijiang, 443200, China; Li, Q., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Wang, Y., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Wang, X., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Qin, Y., National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Cao, X., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Liu, J., National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China; Shao, Z., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; He, W., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, Nanjing, 210094, China",,Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Cellulose; Cellulose nanocrystals; Coatings; Composite structures; Crystal structure; Crystals; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; HMX; Hydrogen bonds; Nanofibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX); Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX); Fabrication strategies; Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane; Interfacial interaction; Nanostructured networks; Sensitivity performance; Ultrasonic technology; Nanocellulose; Cellulose; Coating; Cores; Crystals; Explosives; Infrared Spectroscopy; Shells; Surfaces; aniline derivative; cellulose; explosive; nanofiber; nitramine; nitrobenzene derivative; Aniline Compounds; Cellulose; Explosive Agents; Nanofibers; Nitrobenzenes,"He, W.; Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Jiangsu, China; email: hewedong@njust.edu.cn

2-s2.0-85105026981,"Micro/nanomotors are capable of a wide variety of tasks related, i.e., to biomedical or environmental applications. Light-driven semiconductor-based micromotors are especially appealing, as they can split surrounding water via light irradiation, and therefore, they can move infinitely. However, their motion is typically limited to in-plane motion with four degrees of freedom (4DoF) or even pseudo-1D motion with 2DoF. Herein, magnetically steerable tubular TiO2/Fe3O4/CdS micromotors, termed microsubmarines, with 6DoF motion, based on a fuel-free design where surrounding water acts as fuel upon visible light irradiation, are presented, with an average velocity of 7.9 µm s−1. Besides, the generation of radicals via such water splitting aids the photocatalytic chemicals degradation with the potential to use solar radiation. A light-induced self-electrophoretic mechanism is responsible for the self-propulsion and can be used to predict the motion direction based on the structure and composition. Finally, the TiO2/Fe3O4/CdS microsubmarines are tested in a proof-of-concept application of high-energy explosive, e.g., picric acid, photocatalytic degradation, with the best performance owing to the versatility of 6DoF motion, the surface coating with amorphous TiO2 layer, and UV light. The results can help optimize light-active micromotor design for potential national security and environmental application, hydrogen evolution, and target cargo delivery. © 2021 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85101231401,"Even though HMX is one of the most vigorous energetic materials for solid propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics; it has high thermal stability and low sensitivity to common catalysts. Metal oxides with hydrous surface can release active O ˙ H radicals at low temperature. These active radicals could attack HMX heterocyclic ring and alter HMX decomposition mechanism form C-H bond cleave to hydrogen atom abstraction. This study reports on the facile synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) of 8 nm average particle size. Aluminum NPs of 80 nm was employed in combination with Fe2O3 NPS; this nanothermite binary mixture can induce not only catalytic effect but also vigorously-exothermic thermite reaction with high heat output. Colloidal thermite mixture Fe2O3/Al was effectively-integrated into HMX crystals via co-precipitation technique. Uniform distribution of nanothermite particles into HMX was confirmed via elemental mapping using EDAX. Nanothermite mixture as high energy density material offered an increase in HMX total heat release by 82% using DSC. Furthermore, nanothermite particles offered superior catalytic effect with decrease in HMX activation energy by 25% using Kissinger method. Kinetic decomposition parameters using KAS model were found to be in good agreement with Kissinger's model. Colloidal nanothermite particles can act as high energy density material, and as a catalyst with decrease in required activation energy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Elbasuney S., Yehia M., Hamed A., Mokhtar M., Gobara M., Saleh A., Elsaka E., El-Sayyad G.S.",56387552100;57205973023;57216876828;57219805635;36238083300;56647565600;57216389664;57203584071;,Synergistic Catalytic Effect of Thermite Nanoparticles on HMX Thermal Decomposition,2021,Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials,31,6,,2293,2305,NA,16,10.1007/s10904-021-01916-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101231401&doi=10.1007%2fs10904-021-01916-3&partnerID=40&md5=d78bae4b87e687c5bb877d12ba009f91,"Head of Nanotechnology Research Center, School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Science and Technology Center of Excellence, Cairo, Egypt; Drug Radiation Research Department, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA), Cairo, Egypt","Elbasuney, S., Head of Nanotechnology Research Center, School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt, School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Yehia, M., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Hamed, A., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Mokhtar, M., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Gobara, M., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; Saleh, A., Science and Technology Center of Excellence, Cairo, Egypt; Elsaka, E., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt; El-Sayyad, G.S., School of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College (MTC), Egyptian Armed Forces, Cairo, Egypt, Drug Radiation Research Department, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA), Cairo, Egypt",Catalyst; Energetic materials; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nanoparticles; Thermal behavior,Activation energy; Atoms; Binary mixtures; Catalysts; Decomposition; Hematite; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Phosphorus compounds; Solid propellants; Sols; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Average particle size; Decomposition mechanism; Heterocyclic rings; High energy density materials; High thermal stability; Hydrogen atom abstraction; Total heat release; Uniform distribution; Explosives,"Elbasuney, S.; Head of Nanotechnology Research Center, Egypt; email: s.elbasuney@mtc.edu.eg

To enhance the rate of odor capture for less volatile targets, two temperatures are used for aid preparation. By using an elevated temperature for the target explosive, the amount of vapor is enhanced, increasing the production of the characteristic odor profile. The polymeric adsorbent is maintained at a cool temperature, favoring vapor capture. The success of this two-temperature approach is demonstrated for training aids targeting the low volatility explosive TNT using SPME (solid-phase microextraction) headspace analysis. In addition, the effect of using two temperatures on preparing training aids based on TNT and its more volatile impurities 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT are evaluated in canine trials.

2-s2.0-85096641273,"The water adducts of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) have been observed by using broadband rotational spectroscopy. This work opens a new way for the gas-phase detection of this improvised explosive. The observed clusters exhibit unusual water dynamics and rarely observed multicenter interactions. TATP-H2O is formed from the D3 symmetry conformer of TATP with water lying close to the C3 axis. Water rotation around this axis with a very low barrier gives rise to the rotational spectrum of a symmetric top. The main interaction of the monohydrate is a four-center trifurcated donor Ow-H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bond, not observed previously in the gas phase, reinforced by a weak four-center trifurcated acceptor C−H⋅⋅⋅Ow interaction. Surprisingly, all structural signatures show the weakness of these interactions.

2-s2.0-85092012660,"The generation of constitutive detonation performance model components for high explosives (HEs) invariably involves reference to experiment, as reliable first-principles determinations of these models are beyond our current capability. Whatever its form or complexity, the detonation performance model must be able to accurately capture the detonation wave timing and the energy release that it triggers upon arrival. Specifically, the HE products equation-of-state (EOS), which largely determines the detonating HE's ability to do useful work on its surroundings, is typically inferred from cylinder expansion tests where metal-confined HE cylinders are detonated and the ensuing outer confiner wall-expansion trajectory is recorded. Expensive, iterative comparisons to multimaterial hydrodynamic (or """"hydrocode"""") simulations of these experiments are then used to constrain the parameters of the chosen EOS form. Here, we report on new detonation performance experiments produced for the highly-ideal, plastic-bonded explosive and CL-20-based LX-19 which are used to produce a new sub-scale detonation performance model for the explosive. This includes new products EOS and a new Detonation Shock Dynamics front propagation law. We also confirm the capability of two new, non-hydrocode-based products EOS generation techniques to accelerate the HE model parameterization process. This latter development is particularly significant for detonation performance modeling of new HE formulations. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","Chiquete C., Jackson S.I.",22950136100;7402695193;,Detonation performance of the CL-20-based explosive LX-19,2021,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,38,3,,3661,3669,NA,13,10.1016/j.proci.2020.07.089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092012660&doi=10.1016%2fj.proci.2020.07.089&partnerID=40&md5=236d3acf86af0898e603df2cb10fc36c,"Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Chiquete, C., Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Jackson, S.I., Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",CL-20; Cylinder expansion test; Detonation; Explosive; Performance,Cylinders (shapes); Detonation; Expansion; Iterative methods; CL-20; Current capability; Cylinder expansion test; Detonation performance; Equation-of-state; First principles determination; High explosives; Modeling component; Performance; Performance Modeling; Equations of state,"Chiquete, C.; Shock and Detonation Physics Group, United States; email: chiquete@lanl.gov",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85096454577,"It is critical to understand and mitigate for explosive sensitivity, from applications related to stockpile maintenance and development, to law enforcement safety, to basic research. The handling sensitivity of explosives is controlled by factors that span from fundamental intramolecular effects to mesoscale structure and defects. Although the drop-weight impact test has been used to characterize energetic material sensitivity for over 50 years, there is still very limited understanding on which features of explosives influence or control impact sensitivity. Fundamental chemistry is likely the most important player in handling sensitivity of energetics, however secondary effects such as particle size and morphology are thought to influence the results in impact sensitivity tests. We have recently discovered that batches of trinitrotoluene (TNT) obtained with a freshly synthesized method versus a historical lot sample exhibit significantly different impact sensitivity values. To determine if differences in particle size were the reason for the different results, in the present work we have prepared 13 different samples of TNT and tested each for particle size and impact sensitivity. Though the particle sizes of the samples range from 44 - 1502 µm, impact test values fall mostly within error, given the large standard deviation in the test. The historical lot TNT sample is an exception, and is more sensitive than the newly prepared batches. Overall, more work is needed to determine if other factors such as purity and particle morphology (rather than size) are more important for influencing impact test results in TNT. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

First, cyclic TATP was purified with a solvent mixed with methanol and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]). Second, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) were utilised to analyze the composition of the products. It was proved that the samples matched with the purchased sample to a greater extent. The thermal decomposition process of TATP was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analyser (TGA) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2). Based upon the data of DSC tests, the apparent activation energy (Ea) of these three samples was worked out and compared with the Starink calculation method. The maximum peak temperature (Tmax) and the average decomposition heat (ΔHd) of TATP became lower when the concentration of the [BMIM][BF4] increased because of the mixed solvent. The results of the TG experiments were consistent with those of the DSC tests. Based upon the VSP2 data, the thermal hazard data pertaining to Tmax, the maximum pressure (Pmax), self-heating rate, and the pressure rise rate were obtained. The data derived from this regard decreased when [BMIM][BF4] was added to the mixed solvent. We explored the effects of [BMIM][BF4] on the thermal decomposition hazard of TATP. The decomposition mechanism of TATP was studied when the [BMIM][BF4] was added.

The development of ANFO vapour sensors that are small, inexpensive, and easy to use will enable widespread IED detection in the context of security and humanitarian demining. Because of concealment and the low vapour pressures of most explosive materials, achieving sufficiently high sensitivity and low limits of detection are some of the main challenges of explosives vapour detection. Here ANFO chemiresistive vapour sensors based on polypyrrole (PPy) percolation networks are presented and compared to gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) results for ANFO. Improved sensitivities are achieved by using a polymer percolation network instead of a thin film for the gas sensors.

Remarkable analytical advances have recently been proposed for LIBS and raised its analytical performance to a level never reached before. Most prominent perhaps, have been the development of many nontraditional calibration approaches based on transition atomic energies (emission wavelengths), the use of a single standard for calibration, increase of the ablated sample mass (accumulated laser pulses), and even overcoming severe LIBS problems such as the matrix effects. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fernandes Andrade D., Pereira-Filho E.R., Amarasiriwardena D.",57208686999;57195959174;55394350000;,Current trends in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: a tutorial review,2021,Applied Spectroscopy Reviews,56,2,,98,114,NA,41,10.1080/05704928.2020.1739063,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082407543&doi=10.1080%2f05704928.2020.1739063&partnerID=40&md5=e7e04e3d6ae446e4f6729839d2645a8e,"School of Natural Sciences, Hampshire College, Amherst, MA, United States; Group of Applied Instrumental Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil","Fernandes Andrade, D., School of Natural Sciences, Hampshire College, Amherst, MA, United States, Group of Applied Instrumental Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil; Pereira-Filho, E.R., Group of Applied Instrumental Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil; Amarasiriwardena, D., School of Natural Sciences, Hampshire College, Amherst, MA, United States",calibration; data processing; LIBS; qualitative analysis; sample preparation; signal enhancement,Atomic emission spectroscopy; Calibration; Data processing; Analytical performance; Emission wavelength; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); LIBS; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Sample preparation; Signal enhancement; Data handling,"Amarasiriwardena, D.; School of Natural Sciences, United States; email: daNS@hampshire.edu",Review,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85100558453,"In analytical science, mass spectrometry (MS) is known as a “gold analytical tool” because of its unique character of providing the direct molecular structural information of the relevant analyte molecules. Therefore, MS technique has widely been used in all branches of chemistry along with in proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, lipidomics, environmental monitoring etc. Mass spectrometry-based methods are very much needed for fast and reliable detection and quantification of drugs of abuse and explosives in order to provide fingerprint information for criminal investigation as well as for public security and safety at public places, respectively. Most of the compounds exist as their neutral form in nature except proteins, peptides, nucleic acids that are in ionic forms intrinsically. In MS, ion source is the heart of the MS that is used for ionizing the electrically neutral molecules. Performance of MS in terms of sensitivity and selectivity depends mainly on the efficiency of the ionization source. Accordingly, much attention has been paid to develop efficient ion sources for a wide range of compounds. Unfortunately, none of the commercial ion sources can be used for ionization of different types of compounds. Moreover, in MS, analyte molecules must be released into the gaseous phase and then ionize by using a suitable ion source for detection/quantification. Under these circumstances, fabrication of new ambient ion source and ultrasonic cutter blade-based non-thermal and thermal desorption methods have been taken into account. In this paper, challenges and strategies of mass spectrometry analysis of the drugs of abuse and explosives through fabrication of ambient ionization sources and new desorption methods for non-volatile compounds have been described.

The bacteria, J. cremeus was observed to exhibit significant release of nitrite under both unsaturated as well as saturated conditions. Mass spectrometric studies showed that, both the conditions lead to the formation of nitroso-derivatives of RDX. But under saturated condition, an intermediate, 5-hydroxy-4-nitro-2,4-diazapentanal was observed which is a precursor to 4-nitro-2,4-diazabuatnal ultimately leading to mineralization.

2-s2.0-85101746968,"In this study, nitrated bacterial cellulose (NBC) energetic binder was introduced to prepare NBC-based nanocomposite energetic materials (nEMs) through a combined simple and safe sol-gel method and the freeze-drying technology. A series of analytical and test methods were systematically conducted to characterize the structure, composition, thermal properties, and safety performance of the materials. The results indicated that the particles of nitramine explosives were dispersed and embedded homogeneously in the three-dimensional (3D) porous cross-linked construction of the NBC gel matrix; the crystal growth of the explosive particles was restricted, which led to nanometer-scale composites. The thermal analysis demonstrated that the peak temperature of the composite (e.g., NBC/CL-20: 224.8 °C) was reduced and produced substantial heat release (e.g., NBC/CL-20: 3346 J·g-1) during the process of decomposition. In addition, the mechanism of thermal decomposition was probed, and cyclic catalytic decomposition between the NBC gel and explosives may exist. The sensitivity decreased visibly because of the existence of the cross-linked structure of the gel matrix, which could act as a buffer system to mitigate the release stimulated from the surroundings. Accordingly, this investigation may provide the promising potential for NBC-based energetic composites used in explosives and propellants in the military, and further promote the methodology for manufacturing energetic nanocomposites.  © ","Chen L., Cao X., Gao J., He W., Liu J., Wang Y., Zhou X., Shen J., Wang B., He Y., Tan D.",57220860411;57222170433;57222170915;56549312200;56101451000;57208535430;57110989200;55611659000;56350847700;57225998825;57212144162;,Nitrated Bacterial Cellulose-Based Energetic Nanocomposites as Propellants and Explosives for Military Applications,2021,ACS Applied Nano Materials,4,2,,1906,1915,NA,39,10.1021/acsanm.0c03263,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101746968&doi=10.1021%2facsanm.0c03263&partnerID=40&md5=71590c37b96a0e151de0a1bd952270ab,"Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Inner Mongolia Synthetic Chemical Engineering Institute, Huhhot, 010010, China","Chen, L., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Cao, X., Inner Mongolia Synthetic Chemical Engineering Institute, Huhhot, 010010, China; Gao, J., Inner Mongolia Synthetic Chemical Engineering Institute, Huhhot, 010010, China; He, W., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Liu, J., National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Wang, Y., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Zhou, X., National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Shen, J., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Wang, B., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; He, Y., National Special Superfine Powder Engineering Research Center of China, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Tan, D., Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China",energetic nanocomposites; NBC; nitramine explosives; sensitivity; sol-gel; thermal analysis,Cellulose; Composite propellants; Decomposition; Military applications; Nanocomposites; Nitration; Propellants; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Thermoanalysis; Bacterial cellulose; Catalytic decomposition; Crosslinked structures; Energetic binder; Nitramine explosives; Peak temperatures; Safety performance; Threedimensional (3-d); Explosives; Cellulose; Composites; Explosives; Gels; Materials; Particles; Propellants; Release,"He, W.; Key Laboratory of Special Energy Materials Ministry of Education, China; email: hewedong@njust.edu.cn

2-s2.0-85105065883,"When new explosives are synthesized and developed, handling sensitivity must be measured in a consistent way to dictate safety protocols. Drop-weight impact tests, which represent explosive material sensitivity with the drop height required for a sample to react with 50% probability, are the most common method for understanding and quantifying explosive sensitivity. However, results from impact tests are influenced not only by the explosive material tested but also by the testing conditions and experimental setup. Examples of these testing conditions are the laboratory where the test was performed, the methods for choosing drop height levels and computing sensitivity, and whether grit paper was used to promote the initiation of reactions. We compile a historical data set with over 450 impact test results of the explosive standard pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) from 1959 to 2020. We model the sensitivity of PETN as a function of the test laboratory, the test method, and the use of grit paper and find that all have a significant effect on the measured sensitivity of PETN. We validate the predictions from the fitted model with several new impact tests performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  © 2021 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85079503675,"Aluminum(Al)/ammonium perchlorate(AP)/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) propellant is the most widely used propulsion system currently. Its ignition and combustion processes are fairly complex and need to be better understood. In this study, the thermal decomposition, ignition, and combustion properties of an Al/AP/HTPB propellant were investigated using a thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry and a laser ignition testing system. The morphology and size distribution of the condensed combustion products (CCPs) were analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the thermal decomposition process of the propellant consisted of three stages. The first stage (100–430 °C) was a major mass loss stage and exhibited typical features of AP decomposition. The second stage (430–630 °C) was mainly accompanied by the decomposition of remaining HTPB as well as slight oxidation of Al particles. In the third stage, further oxidation of Al particles resulted in a small mass increase. Due to the continuous emission problem, only a few combustion intermediates were identified in the combustion emission spectrum curves. The propellant combustion process could be roughly divided into three stages, and the flame development stage lasted longer than the flame decline stage. As the pressure increased, the propellant ignition delay time decreased and the burning rate increased significantly. The effect of pressure on ignition delay was more pronounced at low pressures. The CCPs consisted of three types. The oxidation of Al particles in the propellant followed the diffusion reaction mechanism. Agglomerates appeared in several different morphologies and had relatively low combustion efficiency under experimental conditions. A 2-D pocket-like structure was observed on the propellant surface. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Yuan J., Liu J., Zhou Y., Zhang Y., Cen K.",57203502959;56003109800;57191877091;16023380200;57211831215;,Thermal decomposition and combustion characteristics of Al/AP/HTPB propellant,2021,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,143,6,,3935,3944,NA,38,10.1007/s10973-020-09297-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079503675&doi=10.1007%2fs10973-020-09297-4&partnerID=40&md5=0f7223ed1155cad55f598db6e1f90b63,"State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China","Yuan, J., State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Liu, J., State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Zhou, Y., State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Zhang, Y., State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Cen, K., State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China",Aluminized solid propellants; Condensed combustion products; Ignition and combustion characteristics; Pocket structure; Thermal decomposition,Aluminum compounds; Decomposition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Emission spectroscopy; HTPB propellants; Inorganic compounds; Morphology; Oxidation; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Polybutadienes; Propulsion; Pyrolysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Thermolysis; Aluminized solid propellants; Combustion characteristics; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion intermediates; Condensed combustion products; Laser particle size analyzer; Pocket structures; Thermal decomposition process; Ignition,"Liu, J.; State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, China; email: jzliu@zju.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Highly ordered nanowrinkles were prepared by oxygen plasma and stretching treatment of PDMS. Indeed, a tactfully designed zigzag micropattern can efficiently reduce the fracture defects of nanowrinkles because the contraction force can be lessened at releasing step. This proposed substrate has high reproducibility and uniformity that the relative standard deviation (RSD) was below 7 %. With uniform hot spots on this novel flexible SERS substrate, 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) residues can be detected on coarse surfaces of target item. A molecule interaction mechanism of Meisenheimer complex was applied to combine AgNPs and nanowrinkles for highly sensitive detecting TNT. The detection sensitivity of TNT molecules can achieve a limit of 10−13 mol L−1. Additionally, a practical application was proceeded by wiping the cloth bag to detect the TNT residues with a limit of 10−9 mol L−1.

2-s2.0-85081265307,"The current landmine clearance methods mostly rely on the manual use of metal detectors (MDs) and on the deminer’s experience in differentiating between the sounds emitted due to the presence of a landmine or of harmless clutter. This process suffers from high false-alarm rates, which renders the demining effort slow and costly. In this paper, we report our attempts in using machine learning for decision making in the demining process. We have created our own database of the MD responses corresponding to landmines and/or clutter. A robotic rail is designed and assembled to accurately measure these responses and build the database. Several machine learning models are then developed using the database with the aim of detecting the presence of landmines and classifying them.

The development of a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly fluorescence sensing system remains a huge challenge. In this study, we designed and synthesized a TPE@γ-CD-MOF-K complex using the facile in situ encapsulation method. The unique pore structure of γ-CD-MOF allowed it to effectively include TPE and explosives as guests simultaneously. The TPE@γ-CD-MOF-K showed stronger fluorescence emission than TPE and sensitive fluorescence quenching activities in response to nitro-aromatic compounds in the liquid phase with detection limits as low as 3 ppm. Furthermore, TPE@γ-CD-MOF-K can also effectively detect nitro-aromatic compounds in the solid state, which is very convenient for practical detection of explosives. The unique pore structure of γ-CD-MOF-K and the interaction between K+ and nitro compounds play important roles in solid-state quenching.  © ","Qiu Z.-J., Fan S.-T., Xing C.-Y., Song M.-M., Nie Z.-J., Xu L., Zhang S.-X., Wang L., Zhang S., Li B.-J.",57208017496;57220786053;57207945605;57201896623;57220781591;57213677656;57220054628;57207491954;35239389400;7410082748;,Facile Fabrication of an AIE-Active Metal-Organic Framework for Sensitive Detection of Explosives in Liquid and Solid Phases,2020,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,12,49,,55299,55307,NA,48,10.1021/acsami.0c17165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097821369&doi=10.1021%2facsami.0c17165&partnerID=40&md5=d9db1c12ff72232ec71558a09dedb6e2,"Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China; State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; College of Life Science and Technology, Southwest Minzu University, Chengdu, 610041, China","Qiu, Z.-J., Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Fan, S.-T., State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Xing, C.-Y., Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Song, M.-M., State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China; Nie, Z.-J., State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China; Xu, L., Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Zhang, S.-X., Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Wang, L., College of Life Science and Technology, Southwest Minzu University, Chengdu, 610041, China; Zhang, S., State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China; Li, B.-J., Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China",detecting in liquid and solid phase; fluorescence sensing; sensing mechanism; tetraphenylethylene; γ-CD-MOF-K,Aromatic compounds; Explosives; Fluorescence; Heavy metals; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Pore structure; Quenching; Detection of explosives; Encapsulation methods; Fluorescence detector; Fluorescence emission; Fluorescence sensing; Heavy metal contamination; Nitro aromatic compounds; Sensitive detection; Explosives detection,"Li, B.-J.email: libj@cib.ac.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85100355439,"Knowing accurate saturated vapor pressures of explosives at ambient conditions is imperative to provide realistic boundaries on available vapor for ultra-trace detection. In quantifying vapor content emanating from low-volatility explosives, we observed discrepancies between the quantity of explosive expected based on literature vapor pressure values and the amount detected near ambient temperatures. Most vapor pressure measurements for low-volatility explosives, such as RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane) and HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), have been made at temperatures far exceeding 25 °C and linear extrapolation of these higher temperature trends appears to underestimate vapor pressures near room temperature. Our goal was to measure vapor pressures as a function of temperature closer to ambient conditions. We used saturated RDX and HMX vapor sources at controlled temperatures to produce vapors that were then collected and analyzed via atmospheric flow tube-mass spectrometry (AFT-MS). The parts-per-quadrillion (ppqv) sensitivity of AFT-MS enabled measurement of RDX vapor pressures at temperatures as low as 7 °C and HMX vapor pressures at temperatures as low as 40 °C for the first time. Furthermore, these vapor pressures were corroborated with analysis of vapor generated by nebulizing low concentration solutions of RDX and HMX. We report updated vapor pressure values for both RDX and HMX. Based on our measurements, the vapor pressure of RDX at 25 °C is 3 ± 1 × 10-11 atm (i.e., 30 parts per trillion by volume, pptv), the vapor pressure of HMX is 1.0 ± 0.6 × 10-14 atm (10 ppqv) at 40 °C and, with extrapolation, HMX has a vapor pressure of 1.0 ± 0.6 × 10-15 atm (1.0 ppqv) at 25 °C. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

2-s2.0-85098756699,"The development of sensors for rapid detection of chemical explosives with high sensitivity and selectivity is the focus of many research groups. In this work, we have developed a simple and straightforward synthesis of a block (co)polymer functionalized with pyrazoloanthrone (SP). The block (co)polymer was synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate using a PEG-functionalized RAFT-agent. Subsequently, the SP was coupled to the poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) block through DCC coupling. The structural and physicochemical properties of the (co)polymer were studied to explore its potential towards the detection of nitroaromatics as a model for explosives. A systematic comparison is made on the chemosensing behavior of the (co)polymer and three small molecule pyrazoloanthrone analogues with different functional groups (SP, SP-OH and SP-COOH). Fluorescence studies demonstrated a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the four fluorophores in the presence of different nitroaromatics and showed unprecedented selectivity for 2,4,6 trinitrophenol (TNP). The Stern-Volmer rate constants (Ksv) of the SP-functionalized copolymer (Ksv = 9.74 × 104 M-1) showed an ∼3.7 times higher quenching rate constant than its monomer analog (SP) for TNP with a limit of detection (LOD) of 19 ppm. A static quenching mechanism with photoinduced electron transfer process, intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions induce turn off fluorescence behavior. The interference studies with other nitroaromatics in an aqueous medium and real-time analysis in the solid-state methods demonstrate the potential of the block (co)polymer towards practical applications. © the Partner Organisations.","Saravanan S., Ahmad R., Kasthuri S., Pal K., Raviteja S., Nagaraaj P., Hoogenboom R., Nutalapati V., Maji S.",57193482135;57221302844;57207940547;12807107200;57207925689;57210143553;16245174600;23095936500;23980300700;,Pyrazoloanthrone-functionalized fluorescent copolymer for the detection and rapid analysis of nitroaromatics,2021,Materials Chemistry Frontiers,5,1,,238,248,NA,9,10.1039/d0qm00563k,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098756699&doi=10.1039%2fd0qm00563k&partnerID=40&md5=9781dba83c80a4c1f6692620edd79b3c,"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India; Department of Biotechnology and Medical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769008, India; Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit (SSCU), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, 560012, India; Department of Chemistry, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, 600025, India; Supramolecular Chemistry Group, Centre of Macromolecular Chemistry, Department of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, Ghent University, Krijgslaan Ghent, 281 S4, Belgium","Saravanan, S., Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India; Ahmad, R., Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India; Kasthuri, S., Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India; Pal, K., Department of Biotechnology and Medical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769008, India; Raviteja, S., Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit (SSCU), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, 560012, India; Nagaraaj, P., Department of Chemistry, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, 600025, India; Hoogenboom, R., Supramolecular Chemistry Group, Centre of Macromolecular Chemistry, Department of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, Ghent University, Krijgslaan Ghent, 281 S4, Belgium; Nutalapati, V., Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India; Maji, S., Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur Tamil Nadu, 603203, India",,Aromatic compounds; Electron transport properties; Explosives; Fluorescence; Fluorophores; Hydrogen bonds; Physicochemical properties; Quenching; Rate constants; Fluorescence behaviors; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence studies; Intermolecular hydrogen bonding; Photoinduced electron-transfer process; Poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate); Quenching rate constant; Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization; Explosives detection,"Nutalapati, V.; Department of Chemistry, India; email: nvenkat83@gmail.com

2-s2.0-85099966187,"The development of a portable sensor for on-site sensing of 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and other nitro aromatics (NAs) is still needed to strengthen environmental protection and public security. Herein, we report the fabrication of fluorescent few-layered MnO2 nanosheets (FL-MnO2 NSs) via N,N-dimethyl formamide-mediated ultrasonication and hydrothermal treatment. Electron and spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the modification of the FL-MnO2 NSs (named as PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs) with amine-rich polyethyleneimine (PEI) produced planar, β-phase, well-crystalline, and positively charged nanosheets. This PEI-related surface modification not only improves the quantum yield of the FL-MnO2 NSs from 7.6 to 13.2% but also provides multiple binding sites with nitro groups of NAs. It was found that the presence of TNT, as an example of NAs, efficiently quenched the fluorescence of the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs due to the formation of Meisenheimer complexes through the efficient adsorption process. In comparison to PEI-modified MnO2 quantum dots, the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs exhibited relatively high sensitivity to TNT with a limit of detection of 20 pM. By depositing PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs on a filter paper, the as-made paper sensor was capable of visualizing 10 nM TNT in drinking water and 10 μM TNT on a postal envelope through the appearance of a quenching spot under a UV lamp. Besides, the adsorbed PEI polymer enables the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs to electrostatically interact with citrate-capped metal nanoparticles, producing the composites for catalyzing NaBH4-mediated reduction of NAs. Since the PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs possess a large surface area to capture NAs and serve as an electron acceptor for BH4-, the formed composites efficiently catalyze the reaction of NaBH4 and NAs as compared to metal nanoparticles and PEI-FL-MnO2 NSs alone.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Krishna Kumar A.S., Lu C.-Y., Tseng W.-L.",7408038533;35213491300;7202119471;,"Two in One: Poly(ethyleneimine)-Modified MnO2Nanosheets for Ultrasensitive Detection and Catalytic Reduction of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene and Other Nitro Aromatics",2021,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,9,3,,1142,1151,NA,13,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c06224,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099966187&doi=10.1021%2facssuschemeng.0c06224&partnerID=40&md5=d2b3b52af030b621d2d8ee793173da1a,"Department of Chemistry, National Sun Yat-sen University, No. 70, Lien-hai Road, Gushan District, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, No. 100, Shiquan 1st Road, Sanmin District, Kaohsiung, 80708, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, No. 100, Shiquan 1st Road, Sanmin District, Kaohsiung, 80708, Taiwan","Krishna Kumar, A.S., Department of Chemistry, National Sun Yat-sen University, No. 70, Lien-hai Road, Gushan District, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan; Lu, C.-Y., School of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, No. 100, Shiquan 1st Road, Sanmin District, Kaohsiung, 80708, Taiwan; Tseng, W.-L., Department of Chemistry, National Sun Yat-sen University, No. 70, Lien-hai Road, Gushan District, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan, Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, No. 100, Shiquan 1st Road, Sanmin District, Kaohsiung, 80708, Taiwan",amino derivatives; custom security protection; filter paper sensor; fluorescent probe; Meisenheimer complexes; naked-eye detection; nanocatalysts; postal package surface,"Amides; Binding sites; Explosives detection; Fluorescence; Metal nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Polyethylenes; Potable water; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sodium Borohydride; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Adsorption process; Catalytic reduction; Hydrothermal treatments; Limit of detection; Multiple binding sites; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Ultrasensitive detection; Manganese oxide","Tseng, W.-L.; Department of Chemistry, No. 70, Lien-hai Road, Gushan District, Taiwan; email: tsengwl@mail.nsysu.edu.tw",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Twenty large-volume NaI detectors are used to determine the elements composing inspected materials from their specific gamma-ray spectra signatures induced by fast neutrons. The RRTNIS inspection is focused on a specific suspect area selected by X-ray radiography. An unfolding algorithm decomposes the energy spectrum of this suspect area on a database of pure element gamma signatures. A classification is then performed between inorganic materials, such as metals, ceramics, or chemicals, and organic materials like wood, fabrics, or plastic goods. Concerning organic materials, the obtained elemental proportions of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen allow discriminating explosives from illicit drugs and benign substances. This article reports on the final laboratory tests performed at Commissariat à \text{I}^\prime Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA) Saclay, France, to assess the RRTNIS detection performances before further demonstration tests in a real seaport environment. Simulants of explosives and illicit drugs have been hidden at different depths inside iron or wood cargo materials, which are representative of the different neutron and gamma attenuation properties encountered in real cargo containers.

The catalytic performance of BC-10 was the best. In particular, BC-10 could thoroughly degrade four nitro explosives solutions, namely, PNP, 2,4-DNP, 2,4,6-TNP, and TNT (20 mg L-1) under simulated irradiation in 50, 90, 90, and 90 min, respectively; photocatalytic mechanism was exhaustively discussed. Photoelectrochemical, in additon to electron paramagnetic resonance characterizations, suggested that the intrinsic factor for the superior photocatalytic performance was the enhancement of the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers derived from the BiOCl {001} active facets. Moreover, the primary active substance in the system was superoxide radicals. This study may provide new insights on the preparation of efficient catalysts for degrading nitro explosives. © the Partner Organisations.","Yan J., Jin B., Zhao P., Peng R.",57216743894;56597403600;57221282298;7102381552;,Facile fabrication of BiOCl nanoplates with high exposure {001} facets for efficient photocatalytic degradation of nitro explosives,2021,Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,8,3,,777,786,NA,21,10.1039/d0qi01218a,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100825566&doi=10.1039%2fd0qi01218a&partnerID=40&md5=f85a6ce98dbc75e8f359bcf96f83a811,"State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology Email, Mianyang, 621010, China","Yan, J., State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology Email, Mianyang, 621010, China; Jin, B., State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology Email, Mianyang, 621010, China; Zhao, P., State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology Email, Mianyang, 621010, China; Peng, R., State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology Email, Mianyang, 621010, China",,"Carrier mobility; Chemical resistance; Chlorine compounds; Explosives; Irradiation; Nanostructures; Paramagnetic resonance; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Catalytic performance; Ecological environments; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalytic performance; Photoelectrochemicals; Photogenerated charge carriers; Separation efficiency; Bismuth compounds","Yan, J.; State Key Laboratory of Environment-friendly Energy Materials, China; email: jinbo0428@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85089195518,"The fabrication of carbon black/polylactic acid (PLA) electrodes using a 3D printing pen is presented and compared with electrodes obtained by a desktop fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer. The 3D pen was used for the fast production of electrodes in two designs using customized 3D printed parts to act as template and guide the reproducible application of the 3D pen: (i) a single working electrode at the bottom of a 3D-printed cylindrical body and (ii) a three-electrode system on a 3D-printed planar substrate. Both devices were electrochemically characterized using the redox probe [Fe(CN)6]3−/4- via cyclic voltammetry, which presented similar performance to an FDM 3D-printed electrode or a commercial screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) regarding peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) and current density. The surface treatment of the carbon black/PLA electrodes fabricated by both 3D pen and FDM 3D-printing procedures provided substantial improvement of the electrochemical activity by removing excess of PLA, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic images for electrodes fabricated by both procedures. Structural defects were not inserted after the electrochemical treatment as shown by Raman spectra (iD/iG), which indicates that the use of 3D pen can replace desktop 3D printers for electrode fabrication. Inter-electrode precision for the best device fabricated using the 3D pen (three-electrode system) was 4% (n = 5) considering current density and anodic peak potential for the redox probe. This device was applied for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) via square-wave voltammetry of a single-drop of 100 μL placed upon the thee-electrode system, resulting in three reduction peaks commonly verified for TNT on carbon electrodes.

2-s2.0-85099657915,"Nano-sized aluminum (Nano-Al) powders hold promise in enhancing the total energy of explosives and the metal acceleration ability at the same time. However, the near-detonation zone effects of reaction between Nano-Al with detonation products remain unclear. In this study, the overall reaction process of 170 nm Al with RDX explosive and its effect on detonation characteristics, detonation reaction zone, and the metal acceleration ability were comprehensively investigated through a variety of experiments such as the detonation velocity test, detonation pressure test, explosive/window interface velocity test and confined plate push test using high-resolution laser interferometry. Lithium fluoride (LiF), which has an inert behavior during the explosion, was used as a control to compare the contribution of the reaction of aluminum. A thermochemical approach that took into account the reactivity of aluminum and ensuing detonation products was adopted to calculate the additional energy release by afterburn. Combining the numerical simulations based on the calculated afterburn energy and experimental results, the parameters in the detonation equation of state describing the Nano-Al reaction characteristics were calibrated. This study found that when the 170 nm Al content is from 0% to 15%, every 5% increase of aluminum resulted in about a 1.3% decrease in detonation velocity. Manganin pressure gauge measurement showed no significant enhancement in detonation pressure. The detonation reaction time and reaction zone length of RDX/Al/wax/80/15/5 explosive is 64 ns and 0.47 mm, which is respectively 14% and 8% higher than that of RDX/wax/95/5 explosive (57 ns and 0.39 mm). Explosive/window interface velocity curves show that 170 nm Al mainly reacted with the RDX detonation products after the detonation front. For the recording time of about 10 μs throughout the plate push test duration, the maximum plate velocity and plate acceleration time accelerated by RDX/Al/wax/80/15/5 explosive is 12% and 2.9 μs higher than that of RDX/LiF/wax/80/15/5, respectively, indicating that the aluminum reaction energy significantly increased the metal acceleration time and ability of the explosive. Numerical simulations with JWLM explosive equation of state show that when the detonation products expanded to 2 times the initial volume, over 80% of the aluminum had reacted, implying very high reactivity. These results are significant in attaining a clear understanding of the reaction mechanism of Nano-Al in the development of aluminized explosives. © 2021 The Authors","Liu D.-Y., Zhao P., Hay-Yee Chan S., Hng H.H., Chen L.",57190759110;57209849227;57221634605;35562652700;35995373600;,Effects of nano-sized aluminum on detonation characteristics and metal acceleration for RDX-based aluminized explosive,2021,Defence Technology,17,2,,327,337,NA,22,10.1016/j.dt.2020.12.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099657915&doi=10.1016%2fj.dt.2020.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=fc9c684ef6b66e08b71303cb32c0d763,"State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University639798, Singapore","Liu, D.-Y., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University639798, Singapore; Zhao, P., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Hay-Yee Chan, S., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University639798, Singapore; Hng, H.H., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University639798, Singapore; Chen, L., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China",Detonation reaction zone; Explosive metal acceleration; Laser interferometry; Nano-sized aluminum; Thermodynamic equilibrium calculation,Acceleration; Afterburners (engine); Equations of state; Fluorine compounds; Laser interferometry; Lithium Fluoride; Metals; Numerical models; Plate metal; Velocity; Aluminized explosives; Detonation pressure; Detonation product; Detonation velocity; High-resolution laser interferometry; Manganin pressure gauges; Reaction characteristics; Reaction mechanism; Detonation,"Chen, L.; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, China; email: chenlang@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85099637555,"Around 15:00 GMT on August 4th, an explosion occurred in the warehouse facility storing Ammonium Nitrate (AN) at Beirut port, Lebanon. The explosion resulted in more than 178 fatalities and injured more than 6500 people, and also left an estimated 300,000 people homeless and registered as an equivalent to a 3.3 magnitude earth quake. The accident was considered to be the largest of its kind and the most severe anthropological disaster of the decade, the financial loss the nation was subjected to post the explosion was estimated to be around $ 15 billion as informed by the governor. The storage conditions of ammonium nitrate at Beirut port is not definitively known to anyone, and there is no documentation provided so far from the authorities regarding the same. This work focuses on the investigation & consequence analysis of the explosion using TNT equivalent approach. The overpressure and the impulse obtained from TNT calculations are used in probit models to assess the damages caused on human beings and structures. The results obtained in this investigative approach are then utilized to provide an analytical inference relative to the damage proxy map reported by the advance rapid imaging analysis team from NASA. Also, this work examines the existing standards, fire safety measures and legal regulations for ammonium nitrate facilities in the region. AN explosion during storage like other fire and explosion accidents are definitely preventable owing to the technological advancements and developments to prevent or extinguish controllable fires. The significance of this work relates to the methods for calculation of consequences of explosion that are happening due to the storage of highly hazardous explosive materials in excessive quantities and insists the necessity of incorporating adequate safety measures while storing such reactive and hazardous materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Sivaraman S., Varadharajan S.",57203950386;57211272177;,Investigative consequence analysis: A case study research of beirut explosion accident,2021,Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,69,,104387,,,NA,38,10.1016/j.jlp.2020.104387,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099637555&doi=10.1016%2fj.jlp.2020.104387&partnerID=40&md5=641c00f095be85f43da7bd9d3e514fcc,"Department of Health Safety Environment and Civil Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India","Sivaraman, S., Department of Health Safety Environment and Civil Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India; Varadharajan, S., Department of Health Safety Environment and Civil Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India",Accident investigation; Ammonium nitrate; Consequence analysis; Explosion; Lebanon; Probit models; TNT equivalency,Accidents; Civil defense; Hazards; Laws and legislation; Losses; NASA; Nitrates; Storage (materials); Case study research; Consequence analysis; Equivalent approach; Explosion accidents; Explosive materials; Fire and explosion accidents; Storage condition; Technological advancement; Explosions,"Varadharajan, S.; Department of Health Safety Environment and Civil Engineering, India; email: vsurendar1990@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85105406637,"DNT (2,4-dinitrotoluene), a volatile impurity in military grade TNT-based explosives, is a potential tracer for the detection of buried landmines and other explosive devices. We have previously described DNT bioreporter strains, based on a fusion between the Escherichia coli yqjF gene promoter to either a bacterial luxCDABE luminescence gene cassette or to the green fluorescent protein gene gfp. We now present the azoR gene promoter, demonstrated to be strongly induced by DNT, as an alternative sensing element for this compound. An E. coli bioreporter strain harboring a plasmid-borne fusion of the azoR promoter region to Photorhabdus luminescens luxCDABE displayed stronger bioluminescent responses to DNT than the yqjF-based bioreporter. The azoR promoter was induced not directly by DNT but by its degradation products; the most potent inducer was 2,4,5-trihydroxytoluene (THT). This reaction was positively regulated by YhaJ, a member of the LysR family of transcriptional regulators, and was significantly amplified in a yhaK mutant. We also show that DNT degradation in E. coli involves glutathione, which plays a vital role in azoR gene promoter activation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Henshke Y., Shemer B., Belkin S.",57225060613;56957092700;7006299966;,The Escherichia coli azoR gene promoter: A new sensing element for microbial biodetection of trace explosives,2021,Current Research in Biotechnology,3,,,21,28,NA,14,10.1016/j.crbiot.2021.01.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105406637&doi=10.1016%2fj.crbiot.2021.01.003&partnerID=40&md5=76ae72e0e568862a1b13fc12209011c7,"Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel","Henshke, Y., Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel; Shemer, B., Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel; Belkin, S., Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel",azoR; Azoreductase; Bioreporter; Dinitrotoluene; Explosives; Landmines,"2,4 dinitrotoluene; 2,4,5 trihydroxytoluene; toluene derivative; unclassified drug; Article; azoR gene; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bioluminescence; CDABE gene; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene control; gene fusion; microbial degradation; microorganism detection; nonhuman; Photorhabdus luminescens; promoter region; YhaJ gene; yqjF gene","Belkin, S.; Institute of Life Sciences, Israel; email: shimshon.belkin@mail.huji.ac.il",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85092295912,"Due to security and health issues the detection of trace levels of nitro-explosives in solutions is of great importance. In the present study, Sm2Ti2O7 pyrochlore fluorescent nanoparticles were synthesized via a surfactant-directed method. A sol-gel processing route assisted by pluronic P123 in water was used for the synthesis of Sm2Ti2O7 pyrochlore fluorescent nanoparticles. The synthesized Sm2Ti2O7 nanoparticles were applied as a quenching-based fluorescent nanoprobe for the sensitive detection of trace levels of nitrate explosive chemicals, including 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid (PA)), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX). The fluorescence quenching behaviors of Sm2Ti2O7 were checked in acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water mixture media with excitation and emission maxima at 280 and 330 nm, respectively. The pyrochlore nanoprobe presents a more effective turn-off response for nitroaromatic explosives, especially for PA, with a detection limit of 0.01 nM and a high Stern-Volmer constant of 9.9 × 105 M-1 in acetonitrile solvent. Experimental studies such as time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements, comparison of the energy levels of the probe and analytes and analysis of the spectral overlap between the nanoprobe and analytes revealed that the possible mechanism for this dynamic probe-quenching is the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The proposed nanoprobe introduces a quick, reproducible, and cost-effective sensing system for the sensitive detection of nitro-explosives in solution with the highest selectivity to PA. The chemical inertness and photostability of the present STO probe give it the opportunity to be stored for a long time and be used for the monitoring of nitro-explosive pollutants in industrial effluents.

2-s2.0-85091556810,"In analytical mass spectrometry, an efficient desorption is needed for nonvolatile compounds at ultra-trace level detection. In this paper, an ultrasonic cutter-assisted non-thermal desorption method for ultra-trace level detection of different types of nonvolatile compounds such as drugs of abuse, explosives, pharmaceuticals, spinosad, cholesterol, rhodamine B, glucose and amino acids has been described. The relevant compounds were deposited on the ultrasonic blade except pharmaceutical tablets that were used directly, and gently touched on perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) made substrate with oscillation frequency about 40 kHz in order to desorb the solid molecules. The desorbed gaseous molecules were ionized using a home-made helium dielectric barrier discharge ionization (DBDI) source and then detected by an ion trap mass spectrometer. The synergistic effect caused by gaining the oscillation and frictional/mechanical energy enhanced desorption of the solid molecules into gaseous phase, thereby, resulting in detection at ultra-trace level. PFA made substrate showed better limits of detection (LODs) compared to that of wood made substrate. The LOD values for most of the target analytes were ranging from 20.00 ± 0.91 to 200.25 ± 9.04 pg with RSD values ≤ 5% except for pharmaceutical tablets where only depletion amounts were estimated.

2-s2.0-85086726015,"Laboratory safety has been widely concerned, but fire, explosion, poisoning and other accidents occur from time to time. Among them, the proportion of safety accidents, casualties and economic losses caused by explosion are relatively high. In particular, the safety, reliability and maintainability of laboratories in colleges and universities and scientific research institutes should be evaluated and optimized. Therefore, it is necessary to use efficient, reliable and economical methods to identify and monitor the key factors that will cause explosion accidents in the laboratory. In this paper, through the combination of fault tree analysis (FTA) and binary decision diagram (BDD), the three main sources of explosion accidents in laboratory (gas cylinder, pressure device and hazardous chemicals) are analyzed quantitatively. When using BDD to simplify FT operation, a variety of event sorting methods are compared. Finally, it is found that “Level” and “AND” methods can provide a more convenient and reasonable number of cut sets. Considering different methods to measure the importance of basic events, it is found that similar results can be obtained. The importance of Critical is used to identify the importance of events, combined with its change with time, the change of importance is analyzed dynamically. The key factors from four aspects of “human”, “machine”, “environment” and “management” in laboratory explosion accident are determined.

2-s2.0-85099853919,"Explosive blasts and prediction of fatality risks in urban environments is a complicated task due to the variability in blast wave reflection and propagation. The terrorist threats considered in this paper are vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) containing 225 kg or 450 kg of TNT or ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) detonated in an open street. This paper uses Viper::Blast CFD software to estimate the variability of explosive blast loads using Monte-Carlo sampling. To probabilistically model the blast wave, the paper takes into consideration the variability of explosive charge mass, detonation location, height of detonation, net equivalent quantity, atmospheric pressure and temperature, and model errors. The fatality risk assessment combines lung-rupture, whole-body displacement and skull fracture dependant on the pressure and impulse. It was found that the mean fatality risk for a 450 kg home-made ANFO explosive device detonated at a road T-intersection is 16% for people exposed in the street. If bollards were placed 10 m from the main street then fatality risk for people in the main street is reduced by over 90%.

2-s2.0-85101617410,"A simple and sensitive fluorometric method is developed utilizing aggregation-induced emission probe based silica nanoparticles for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives. A positively charged tetraphenylethene based probe (TPE-C2-2+) is doped into silica nanoparticles exploiting electrostatic interactions to produce TPE-SiO2 nanoparticles with a uniform particle size. The TPE-SiO2 nanoparticles exhibit strong fluorescence emission due to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect of the doped TPE probe. The fluorescence emission of TPE-SiO2 offers quantitative and sensitive response to picric acid (PA), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) which are used as model examples of nitroaromatic compounds. The fluorescence spectroscopy results show that the fluorescence emission of TPE-SiO2 was greatly quenched in the presence of the electron-poor nitroaromatic compounds due to the inner filter effect (IFE) and possibly the contact quenching mechanism. TPE-SiO2 nanoparticles show better sensitivity towards PA and could detect PA down to 0.01 μM with a linear detection range of 0.1-50 μM. The increased chemical stability, efficient high sensitivity and simple synthesis of the TPE-SiO2 nanoparticles demonstrate that they can be used as an excellent fluorescent probe for a wide range of electron-poor compounds, i.e. nitroaromatic compounds. Interference studies show that common interfering species with nitroexplosives such as acids, bases, volatile organic compounds, and salt solutions have a negligible effect during the sensing process.

2-s2.0-85096508952,"The development of analytical techniques for antioxidant compounds is important, because antioxidants that can inactivate reactive species and radicals are health-beneficial compounds, also used in the preservation of food and protection of almost every kind of organic substance from oxidation. Energetic substances include explosives, pyrotechnics, propellants and fuels, and their determination at bulk/trace levels is important for the safety and well-being of modern societies exposed to various security threats. Most of the time, in field/on site detection of these important analytes necessitates the use of colorimetric sensors and probes enabling naked-eye detection, or low-cost and easy-to-use fluorometric sensors. The use of nanosensors brings important advantages to this field of analytical chemistry due to their various physico-chemical advantages of increased surface area, surface plasmon resonance absorption of noble metal nanoparticles, and superior enzyme-mimic catalytic properties. Thus, this critical review focuses on the design strategies for colorimetric sensors and nanoprobes in characterizing antioxidant and energetic substances. In this regard, the main themes and properties in optical sensor design are defined and classified. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors/probes are discussed with respect to their mechanisms of operation, namely formation and growth of noble metal nanoparticles, their aggregation and disaggregation, displacement of active constituents by complexation or electrostatic interaction, miscellaneous mechanisms, and the choice of metallic oxide nanoparticles taking part in such formulations.

2-s2.0-85094194711,"Nitroaromatic explosives are major pollutants produced during wars that cause serious environmental and health problems. The removal of a typical nitroaromatic explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), from aqueous solution, was conducted using a new recyclable magnetic nano-adsorbent (Fe@SiO2–NH2). This adsorbent was prepared by grafting amino groups onto Fe@SiO2 particles with a well-defined core-shell structure and demonstrated monodispersity in solution. The removal performance of the nano-adsorbent towards TNT was found to be 2.57 and 4.92 times higher than that towards two analogous explosives, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), respectively, under neutral conditions. The difference in the removal performance among the three compounds was further compared in terms of the effects of different conditions (pH value, ionic strength, humic acid concentration, adsorbent modification degree and dosage, etc.) and the electrostatic potential distributions of the three compounds. The most significant elevation is owing to modification of amino on Fe@SiO2 which made a 20.7% increase in adsorption efficiency of TNT. The experimental data were well fit by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model, indicating multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface. The experimental results and theoretical considerations show that the interactions between Fe@SiO2–NH2 NPs and TNT correspond to dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions should be considered in the design of an adsorbent. Furthermore, the adaptability to aqueous environment and excellent regeneration capacity of Fe@SiO2–NH2 NPs makes these remediation materials promising for applications. © 2020","Li J., Zhou Q., Li M., Liu Y., Song Q.",56563180600;24400373800;35215759900;57151534300;57204067085;,"Monodisperse amino-modified nanosized zero-valent iron for selective and recyclable removal of TNT: Synthesis, characterization, and removal mechanism",2021,Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),103,,,69,79,NA,12,10.1016/j.jes.2020.10.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094194711&doi=10.1016%2fj.jes.2020.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=70493c6fd438ed1486e787cc80b7031c,"School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control, College of Chemical Engineering and Environment, China University of Petroleum Beijing, Beijing, 102249, China; School of Environment, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, Henan  453007, China","Li, J., School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control, College of Chemical Engineering and Environment, China University of Petroleum Beijing, Beijing, 102249, China; Zhou, Q., State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control, College of Chemical Engineering and Environment, China University of Petroleum Beijing, Beijing, 102249, China; Li, M., School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Liu, Y., School of Environment, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, Henan  453007, China; Song, Q., School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China","2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT); Mechanism; Nanosized zero-valent iron particles (NZVIs); Regeneration; Removal","Aromatic compounds; Explosives; Hydrophobicity; Ionic strength; Iron; Silica; Silicon; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Electrostatic potential distribution; Freundlich adsorption isotherms; Heterogeneous surface; Hydrophobic interactions; Nanosized zero-valent iron; Nitroaromatic explosives; Pseudo-second-order kinetic models; Adsorption; adsorption; aqueous solution; iron nanoparticle; pollutant removal; recycling; remediation; trinitrotoluene; iron; silicon dioxide; trinitrotoluene; adsorption; water pollutant; Adsorption; Iron; Silicon Dioxide; Trinitrotoluene; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Zhou, Q.; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, China; email: zhouqx@cup.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85086048162,"Energetic materials are often disposed by open-burning or open-detonation as it is a cost-effective and efficient means of destroying explosive material, and often minimizes the need to transport hazardous explosives to treatment facilities. This practice is often scrutinized for the negative environmental impact of the odorous and unsightly toxic gaseous emissions as well as the resulting deposition residues, which often contain unburned energetic materials. With the increasing use of Insensitive High Explosive compositions in munitions, it is essential that the potential environmental impact of their disposal is assessed before their extensive use to prevent the kind of contamination incidents experienced with legacy explosives. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a controlled laboratory experiment to identify the gaseous emissions and the energetic material residues that are generated through the combustion of the IHE components 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). A sealed vial containing small (mg) quantities of energetic material was heated until the energetic material combusted. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to calculate the oxygen consumption and to identify the gases that were generated. The solid residues were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify unburned energetic material. Results showed that DNAN was the most resistant to burning, thus leaving significant quantities of unreacted starting material in the vial. An interesting observation for the IHE formulation was that DNAN also inhibited the combustion of NTO and RDX. The gases emitted during the open burning of IHE components and mixtures included CO, CO2, and N2O as expected, but the proportions differed when the components and mixture were compared, reflecting the influence of DNAN on the burning behavior. From our data, we concluded that open-burning DNAN-based formulations is an environmentally unfavorable waste-management practice for the disposal of IHEs mainly due to generation of solid residues as well as unburnt DNAN. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Galante E.B.F., Mai N., Ladyman M.K., Gill P.P., Temple T.J., Coulon F.",35748586900;57192154121;57192157837;55192818500;56180873000;55887153000;,"Evaluation of small-scale combustion of an insensitive high explosive formulation containing 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)",2021,Journal of Energetic Materials,39,1,,85,99,NA,10,10.1080/07370652.2020.1762798,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086048162&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2020.1762798&partnerID=40&md5=995123474149293e9b05dd8e71726649,"Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom; Chemical Engineering, IME–Instituto Militar De Engenharia, Brazilian Army, Brazil","Galante, E.B.F., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom, Chemical Engineering, IME–Instituto Militar De Engenharia, Brazilian Army, Brazil; Mai, N., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom; Ladyman, M.K., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom; Gill, P.P., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom; Temple, T.J., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom; Coulon, F., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Swindon, United Kingdom",combustion products; environment; explosives; ICT Thermodynamic Code; Open-burning,,"Temple, T.J.; Centre for Defence Chemistry, United Kingdom; email: t.temple@cranfield.ac.uk",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85101867212,"2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a relatively new and promising insensitive high-explosive (IHE) material that remains only partially characterized. IHEs are of interest for a range of applications and from a fundamental science standpoint, as the root causes behind insensitivity are poorly understood. We adopt a multitheory approach based on reactive molecular dynamic simulations performed with density functional theory, density functional tight-binding, and reactive force fields to characterize the reaction pathways, product speciation, reaction kinetics, and detonation performance of LLM-105. We compare and contrast these predictions to 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), a prototypical IHE, and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX), a more sensitive and higher performance material. The combination of different predictive models allows access to processes operative on progressively longer timescales while providing benchmarks for assessing uncertainties in the predictions. We find that the early reaction pathways of LLM-105 decomposition are extremely similar to TATB; they involve intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer.

2-s2.0-85099960451,"The diffusion coefficient is an important parameter in the field of migration and diffusion. Different diffusion theories have been established to estimate the diffusion coefficient, including the weight gain rate. However, the research was based on the migration of different solvents into simple polymers. Few reports focused on the migration of components from propellant and liner into ethylene-propylene terpolymer (EPDM) insulation. In this paper, a new parameter named surface area diffusion rate was proposed to measure the migration of components from propellant and liner at interfaces of EPDM insulation, and the comparison with the traditional weight gain rate was made. The result shows that the surface area diffusion rate is independent of the shape of the material and is more reliable than previously used methods. Furthermore, the relationship of the surface area diffusion rate with time and temperature was investigated. In addition, the diffusion activation energy and the relationship of surface area diffusion rate with the bonding properties were discussed. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Gao H., Chen F., Cai R., Ye S., Tan F., Xiong W., Yi Y., Hu W.",57215705766;57221716782;55448321800;57221720957;57221728014;56112626100;56549424300;57199745715;,The Diffusion of Components from Propellant and Liner at the Interfaces of EPDM Insulation,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,3,,460,467,NA,15,10.1002/prep.202000270,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099960451&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000270&partnerID=40&md5=0071762c90ce2d3d09e9f0f7f38e4799,"Guangdong Provincial Key laboratory of Advanced Welding Technology, China-Ukraine E.O.Paton Institute of Welding, No. 363 Changxing Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong  510651, China; National Engineering Research Center of Rubber and Plastic Sealing, Guangzhou Mechanical Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., No. 2 Xinrui Road, Huangpu District, Guangzhou, 510700, China; The 42nd Institute of the Fourth Academy of CASC, No. 58 Qinghe Road, Xiangyang, Hubei  441003, China; Songshan Lake Materials laboratory, Building A1, Innovation City, Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China","Gao, H., Guangdong Provincial Key laboratory of Advanced Welding Technology, China-Ukraine E.O.Paton Institute of Welding, No. 363 Changxing Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong  510651, China; Chen, F., The 42nd Institute of the Fourth Academy of CASC, No. 58 Qinghe Road, Xiangyang, Hubei  441003, China; Cai, R., The 42nd Institute of the Fourth Academy of CASC, No. 58 Qinghe Road, Xiangyang, Hubei  441003, China; Ye, S., National Engineering Research Center of Rubber and Plastic Sealing, Guangzhou Mechanical Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., No. 2 Xinrui Road, Huangpu District, Guangzhou, 510700, China; Tan, F., National Engineering Research Center of Rubber and Plastic Sealing, Guangzhou Mechanical Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., No. 2 Xinrui Road, Huangpu District, Guangzhou, 510700, China; Xiong, W., National Engineering Research Center of Rubber and Plastic Sealing, Guangzhou Mechanical Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., No. 2 Xinrui Road, Huangpu District, Guangzhou, 510700, China; Yi, Y., Guangdong Provincial Key laboratory of Advanced Welding Technology, China-Ukraine E.O.Paton Institute of Welding, No. 363 Changxing Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong  510651, China; Hu, W., The 42nd Institute of the Fourth Academy of CASC, No. 58 Qinghe Road, Xiangyang, Hubei  441003, China, Songshan Lake Materials laboratory, Building A1, Innovation City, Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China",Diffusion; Diffusion coefficient; EPDM insulation; Surface area diffusion rate,Activation energy; Ethylene; Insulation; Propellants; Bonding property; Different solvents; Diffusion activation energy; Diffusion rate; Diffusion theory; Migration and diffusion; New parameters; Weight-gain rates; Diffusion,"Yi, Y.; Guangdong Provincial Key laboratory of Advanced Welding Technology, No. 363 Changxing Road, China; email: Yiyy@gwi.gd.cn

Cracking Al particles is an efficient way to enhance reactivity and energy release. In the present work, we confirm the crack of Al nanoparticles in hot energetic materials by molecularly simulating the evolution of Al@Al2O3 nanoparticles (ANPs) with imperfect shells and Al slabs covered by perfect Al2O3 layers in a heated widely applied energetic material, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). The thickening of imperfect shells at an ambient condition by the outward migration of core Al atoms to react with RDX is observed. This thickening is helpful to strengthen the shells and hold melted Al and enhance the internal stress until the crack. While the perfect shells protect the reactions between core Al atoms and RDX, they also induce a crack when heating ANPs at a high temperature. This work is also expected to present an atomic perspective about the structural evolution of other active metallic particles in the wavefront as an extreme in the application.  © ","Zhong K., Niu L., Li G., Zhang C.",57195054297;56156671300;56948473700;55703892500;,Crack Mechanism of Al@Al2O3Nanoparticles in Hot Energetic Materials,2021,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,125,4,,2770,2778,NA,13,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c10479,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100619731&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.0c10479&partnerID=40&md5=eb7a545586cc9507202dec9ccfd0b632,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), P.O.

2-s2.0-85091930187,"The growing threat of terrorism has triggered an urgent need to find effective ways to improve the analysis of explosives. This will aid forensic scientists in analysing the post-blast debris, which in turn helps the law enforcement agencies to frame suitable regulations. Analysis of post-blast debris is challenging as it hosts a massive amount of complexity. There are various techniques reported till date such as mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of post-blast residues. However, none of them has been able to identify the structural composition of the explosives. The current research study focuses on identifying the structural composition of the explosives from the post-blast debris using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. The post-blast analytes were extracted from soil samples, cleaned by the solid phase extraction (SPE) method and were rapidly analysed by the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.

This review shows that (1) few characterizations are available for TATB-based PBXs. This gap is filled in this paper. An extensive database is detailed for the CEA M2 explosive composition. The HMX and TATB database then enables selection of the deformation mechanisms to be considered: viscoelasticity, damage-induced anisotropy and its effectivity (i.e.: whether or not the damage is influenced by the loading direction), plasticity with kinematic and isotropic hardenings, pressure and temperature dependencies and asymmetric failure threshold. The review also shows that (2) HMX- and TATB-based materials share close elastic and ultimate properties when the compositions (binders, solid volume fractions) and the mechanical behavior of the two crystals differ. The constitutive laws proposed in the literature are reiterated. In our opinion, a universal law could be proposed in the near future, each material being considered by its own set of parameters.

2-s2.0-85092452039,"Disasters caused by large-scale ammonium nitrate (AN) detonations initiated by fires are well known. The Beirut explosion is again a very sad event with disastrous consequences, but it is not a surprise in the sense of a new phenomenon. It is tragic that calamities with AN occur despite ample guidelines for prevention. Knowledge of the decomposition of AN over the years has greatly progressed, as well how to initiate a detonation with a strong shock wave from a high explosive charge. However, to reproduce the initiation of a detonation by a fire under controlled laboratory conditions never succeeded. The details of the transition of decomposing AN to a detonation remained an open question. Is it a deflagration to detonation mechanism, or is it a shock to detonation one? Knowledge of this may further help process safety measures for the product. The paper will bring research contributions from over a century together, it will develop a scenario how this disaster could happen in Beirut, how much of the AN contributed to the blast, and how further research effort could be beneficial. In addition, the paper estimates the TNT mass equivalent of the AN detonation in Beirut employing three different methods. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","Pasman H.J., Fouchier C., Park S., Quddus N., Laboureur D.",7003939527;57195068023;57135521600;8275457400;36106271900;,Beirut ammonium nitrate explosion: Are not we really learning anything?,2020,Process Safety Progress,39,4,e12203,,,NA,42,10.1002/prs.12203,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092452039&doi=10.1002%2fprs.12203&partnerID=40&md5=92a3c6af828aa2782bdc6adc5dd919d9,"TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Texas A & M University System, College Station, TX, United States; Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics Department, von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Sint Genesius Rode, Belgium","Pasman, H.J., TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Texas A & M University System, College Station, TX, United States; Fouchier, C., Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics Department, von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Sint Genesius Rode, Belgium; Park, S., TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Texas A & M University System, College Station, TX, United States; Quddus, N., TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Texas A & M University System, College Station, TX, United States; Laboureur, D., TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Texas A & M University System, College Station, TX, United States, Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics Department, von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Sint Genesius Rode, Belgium",ammonium nitrate; Beirut explosion; detonation; thermal decomposition; TNT equivalency,Combustion; Decomposition; Disasters; Nitrates; Shock waves; Ammonium nitrate; Controlled laboratories; High explosive charge; Process safety; Research efforts; Shock to detonations; Strong shock waves; Detonation,"Pasman, H.J.; TEES Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, United States; email: hjpasman@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85104035953,"Nano-thermites or metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) have been implemented into modern research on energetic materials as they offer much higher energy densities, higher rates of energy release, stability, and safety (lower sensitivity). This paper reviews several synthetic methods for MICs that have been well thought-out for energetic applications, advantages and disadvantages, as well as the characteristics of each manufacturing technique. The techniques presented include powder mixing, sol-gel, synthesis of MICs based on nano-porous silicon (Psi), sputtering, multilayer nano-foils and electrolytically plated carbon nano-materials for nano-thermite applications. These techniques offer enormously different characteristics and, through the variation of various chemical techniques and conditions, a wide range of chemical and energetic properties may be attained. This may give the opportunity for the safe use of MICs as replacements for some conventional energetic materials in various applications, and may also enable us to study the effects when incorporating these MICs into energetic matrixes, as a promising and feasible research field. © 2021.

2-s2.0-85093942985,"Millions of tons of all kind of munitions, including mines, bombs and torpedoes have been dumped after World War II in the marine environment and do now pose a new threat to the seas worldwide. Beside the acute risk of unwanted detonation, there is a chronic risk of contamination, because the metal vessels corrode and the toxic and carcinogenic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and metabolites) leak into the environment. While the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress in the target biota, we had the idea if TNT can induce the gene expression of carbonyl reductase in blue mussels. Carbonyl reductases are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. They metabolize xenobiotics bearing carbonyl functions, but also endogenous signal molecules such as steroid hormones, prostaglandins, biogenic amines, as well as sugar and lipid peroxidation derived reactive carbonyls, the latter providing a defence mechanism against oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we identified and cloned the gene coding for carbonyl reductase from the blue mussel Mytilus spp. by a bioinformatics approach. In both laboratory and field studies, we could show that TNT induces a strong and concentration-dependent induction of gene expression of carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel. Carbonyl reductase may thus serve as a biomarker for TNT exposure on a molecular level which is useful to detect TNT contaminations in the environment and to perform a risk assessment both for the ecosphere and the human seafood consumer. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Strehse J.S., Brenner M., Kisiela M., Maser E.",57195674996;7402358475;15850520500;7005952755;,The explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) induces gene expression of carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel (Mytilus spp.): a new promising biomarker for sea dumped war relicts?,2020,Archives of Toxicology,94,12,,4043,4054,NA,14,10.1007/s00204-020-02931-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093942985&doi=10.1007%2fs00204-020-02931-y&partnerID=40&md5=9ec9ea611d940a41de506b4ca37adf13,"Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, University Medical School Schleswig-Holstein, Brunswiker Str. 10, Kiel, 24105, Germany; Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Am Handelshafen 12, Bremerhaven, 27570, Germany","Strehse, J.S., Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, University Medical School Schleswig-Holstein, Brunswiker Str. 10, Kiel, 24105, Germany; Brenner, M., Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Am Handelshafen 12, Bremerhaven, 27570, Germany; Kisiela, M., Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, University Medical School Schleswig-Holstein, Brunswiker Str. 10, Kiel, 24105, Germany; Maser, E., Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, University Medical School Schleswig-Holstein, Brunswiker Str. 10, Kiel, 24105, Germany",Biomarker; Blue mussels; Carbonyl reductase; Dumped munitions; Oxidative stress; Short-chain dehydrogenases reduactases (SDR),"biogenic amine; carbonyl derivative; carbonyl reductase; complementary DNA; lipid; prostaglandin; RNA 18S; short chain dehydrogenase/reductase; steroid hormone; sugar; trinitrotoluene; xenobiotic agent; alcohol dehydrogenase; environmental marker; explosive; trinitrotoluene; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; conductance; DNA synthesis; gene expression; gene identification; gene induction; gene sequence; gill; hepatopancreas; light dark cycle; lipid peroxidation; molecular cloning; muscle; muscle tissue; Mytilus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; RNA extraction; salinity; Sanger sequencing; weapon; animal; biology; biosynthesis; bomb; dose response; drug effect; environmental monitoring; enzyme induction; enzymology; genetics; hazardous waste; Mytilus edulis; sea; toxicity; war; water pollutant; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Bombs; Computational Biology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Enzyme Induction; Explosive Agents; Hazardous Waste; Mytilus edulis; Oceans and Seas; Risk Assessment; Trinitrotoluene; Water Pollutants, Chemical; World War II","Maser, E.; Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, Brunswiker Str. 10, Germany; email: maser@toxi.uni-kiel.de",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85088630762,"Genetically engineered microbial biosensors, capable of detecting traces of explosives residues above buried military ordnance and emitting an optical signal in response, may potentially serve for the standoff detection of buried landmines. A promising candidate for such an application is a previously reported Escherichia coli-based reporter strain that employs the yqjF gene promoter as its sensing element; however, for this sensor to be able to detect actual landmines reliably, it was necessary for its detection sensitivity and signal intensity to be enhanced. In this study, a high-throughput approach was employed to screen the effects of individual gene deletions on yqjF activation by 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT).

The most promising of these mutations were introduced into the sensor strain, individually or in pairs, yielding a considerable increase in signal intensity and a lowering of the detection threshold.

2-s2.0-85074391812,"In this article, a series of nano-Cu-Fe composite metal oxides (nano CuO/Fe2O3), with different molar ratios of CuO/Fe2O3 (1:2, 1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.25), were prepared in large-scale by mechanical grinding. The microstructures, surface elements and morphologies of samples are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic effects of nano-Cu-Fe composite metal oxides on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) were investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) techniques. The results show that nano-Cu-Fe composite metal oxides with the molar ratio of CuO/Fe2O3 = 1:2 have the best catalytic effect for AP thermal decomposition as compared to the other nano-Cu-Fe composite metal oxides, the single nano CuO, and nano Fe2O3.

The sensing is based on the quenching of the Raman intensity of a zirconium-based MOF, Zr6O4(OH)4(dcppy)6(MOF1, UiO-67-dcppy; dcppy is 2-phenylpyridine-5,4′-dicarboxylate), where 50% of the signal quenches swiftly within ∼ 5 s of its exposure to trinitrophenol (TNP) vapours, while 90% of the Raman signal was quenched in 30 s. The high surface area of porous MOFs provides increased adsorption of various nitro analytes. The quenching of Raman peaks resulted from the π-π interactions of the analytes with the benzene ring of the MOF. The sensors have also been proven to be reversible and stable by mild heat treatment (80 °C for 5 min). These notable results using Raman spectroscopy point to a new and important approach towards explosive sensing using metal-organic frameworks considering their vast versatility.

It is generally assumed that MIP selectivity depends mainly on compatibility between the analyte and polymer being used. Accordingly, less research has concentrated on applying imprinting techniques to modify the polymeric material. Where applied, imprinting has traditionally been carried out with one or two small target molecules simply mixed with or loaded on polymers. In this study, we employed a novel alternative protocol incorporating dengue virus particles to assist imprinting of DNT. The binding sites and affinity of DNT with dengue surface protein were simulated for enhancing MIP selectivity. Composite MIP sensors were produced and tested to detect explosive molecules including DNT, TNT, and PETN in aqueous solution. Interestingly, the sensor fabricated with DNT template and dengue virus co-imprinting demonstrated improved TNT selectivity as compared to the other MIP sensors.

2-s2.0-85098762064,"This paper presents a hybrid pattern recognition with temperature compensation (HPR-TC) used within an E-Nose system. HPR-TC with E-nose has the novelty, amongst MEMS sensor platforms, of having two modes of operation i.e., rapid mode of detection to be used in time-critical conditions and comprehensive analysis mode for improved detection accuracy. Two modes of operations in HPR-TC are possible because of the implementation of hybrid PR featuring a combination of two different data analysis techniques for explosive sensing. The first part of the hybrid PR is the binary PR based on threshold-based detection and the second one is the analog PR based on PCA and K-mean. The E-Nose system with proposed HPR-TC is validated with two different highly sensitive MEMS sensor types, i.e., SU8 and Si3Nx piezo-resistive cantilever. These MEMS sensors are coated with surface receptors, 4-MBA, 6-MNA and 4-ATP, to improve the selectivity. The E-Nose system can detect explosive compounds such as TNT, RDX, and PETN, in a controlled environment at a concentration as low as 16ppb of TNT, 56ppb of RDX and 134ppb of PETN. Furthermore, measurements show that E-Nose with temperature compensated binary PR can detect the explosives with a detection accuracy higher than 74% as true positives and higher than 79% as true negatives in a short time, within initial 17 seconds of the experiment. However, the temperature compensated analog PR gives a detailed classification of explosives with a higher detection accuracy of 80% as true positives and 86% as true negatives after approximately 95 seconds. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Palaparthy V.S., Doddapujar S.N., Surya S.G., Chandorkar S.A., Mukherji S., Baghini M.S., Ramgopal Rao V.",57204280995;57214241914;54915456300;24365909100;57197033574;9635357300;7402899220;,Hybrid Pattern Recognition for Rapid Explosive Sensing with Comprehensive Analysis,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,21,6,9306798,8011,8019,NA,12,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3047271,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098762064&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2020.3047271&partnerID=40&md5=640f45bb95c54928e5f7b5e09a9f5e99,"Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, 560012, India; Biosciences and Bioengineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India","Palaparthy, V.S., Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Doddapujar, S.N., Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Surya, S.G., Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Chandorkar, S.A., Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, 560012, India; Mukherji, S., Biosciences and Bioengineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Baghini, M.S., Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; Ramgopal Rao, V., Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India",explosive detection; hybrid pattern recognition; multi-coatings; Piezoresistive cantilevers; rapid sensing; software temperature compensation,Electronic nose; Explosives; Pattern recognition systems; Silicon compounds; Comprehensive analysis; Controlled environment; Data analysis techniques; Detailed classification; Explosive compounds; Piezo-resistive cantilevers; Temperature compensated; Temperature compensation; Explosives detection,"Baghini, M.S.; Electrical Engineering Department, India; email: mshojaei@iitb.ac.in

2-s2.0-85096699917,"Although colorimetric detection based on reagents has been widely used in the fields of practical trace analysis, its versatility for detecting multitargets remains the most challenging problem. As a proof of concept, a general colorimetric reagent based on potassium isopropanol (C3H7KO) and dimethyl sulfoxide for one-step instantaneous detection and discrimination of typical military and improvised explosives was designed. Vivid colors from none to purple red, blue green, yellow green, and green were shown, respectively, when detecting 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), elemental sulfur (S), and potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The unique design including the specific nucleophilic addition reaction and the base-catalyzed oxidation-induced electron transfer ensures perfect selectivity even upon facing more than 20 interferents. It is further experimentally demonstrated that the confinement effect introduced by Tween-20 plays an essential role in enhancing the color signal on the surface and thus boosts the detection performance even with a mass as low as 1.45 ng. The applicability of this versatile colorimetric reagent was further verified by integrating the reagent onto paper strips for the in-field identification of TNT, DNT, S, and KMnO4with the help of a portable smartphone-based microscope apparatus, and a practical detection mass of 10.3 ng could be realized. We expect the present colorimetric reagent design strategy would pave a way for one-step instantaneous visual detection toward trace multianalytes. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

2-s2.0-85089908007,"The development of a new, lower cost method for trace explosives recovery from complex samples is presented using miniaturised, click-together and leak-free 3D-printed solid phase extraction (SPE) blocks. For the first time, a large selection of ten commercially available 3D printing materials were comprehensively evaluated for practical, flexible and multiplexed SPE using stereolithography (SLA), PolyJet and fused deposition modelling (FDM) technologies. Miniaturised single-piece, connectable and leak-free block housings inspired by Lego® were 3D-printed in a methacrylate-based resin, which was found to be most stable under different aqueous/organic solvent and pH conditions, using a cost-effective benchtop SLA printer. Using a tapered SPE bed format, frit-free packing of multiple different commercially available sorbent particles was also possible. Coupled SPE blocks were then shown to offer efficient analyte enrichment and a potentially new approach to improve the stability of recovered analytes in the field when stored on the sorbent, rather than in wet swabs. Performance was measured using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry and was better, or similar, to commercially available coupled SPE cartridges, with respect to recovery, precision, matrix effects, linearity and range, for a selection of 13 peroxides, nitramines, nitrate esters and nitroaromatics. Mean % recoveries from dried blood, oil residue and soil matrices were 79 ± 24%, 71 ± 16% and 76 ± 24%, respectively. Excellent detection limits between 60 fg for 3,5-dinitroaniline to 154 pg for nitroglycerin were also achieved across all matrices. To our knowledge, this represents the first application of 3D printing to SPE of so many organic compounds in complex samples. Its introduction into this forensic method offered a low-cost, ‘on-demand’ solution for selective extraction of explosives, enhanced flexibility for multiplexing/design alteration and potential application at-scene. © 2020 The Authors","Irlam R.C., Hughes C., Parkin M.C., Beardah M.S., O'Donnell M., Brabazon D., Barron L.P.",57193189344;57203379721;7005104365;6506163935;57208755025;55882869400;58862392600;,Trace multi-class organic explosives analysis in complex matrices enabled using LEGO®-inspired clickable 3D-printed solid phase extraction block arrays,2020,Journal of Chromatography A,1629,,461506,,,NA,14,10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461506,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089908007&doi=10.1016%2fj.chroma.2020.461506&partnerID=40&md5=7f80cb2dba6c328074b1f67b93ca1442,"Department Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, King's College London, 150 Stamford St., London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Advanced Processing Technology Research Centre, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland; Eurofins Forensic Services, Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom; Environmental Research Group, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, United Kingdom","Irlam, R.C., Department Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, King's College London, 150 Stamford St., London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Hughes, C., Advanced Processing Technology Research Centre, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland; Parkin, M.C., Eurofins Forensic Services, Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Beardah, M.S., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom; O'Donnell, M., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom; Brabazon, D., Advanced Processing Technology Research Centre, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland; Barron, L.P., Department Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, King's College London, 150 Stamford St., London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom, Environmental Research Group, Imperial College London, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, United Kingdom",3D printing; Complex matrices; Forensic science; High resolution mass spectrometry; Solid phase extraction,"Cost effectiveness; Explosives; Fused Deposition Modeling; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Nitrates; Phase separation; Recovery; Analyte enrichment; Aqueous/organic solvents; Detection limits; Fused deposition modelling; Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries; Selective extraction; Solid-phase extraction; Sorbent particles; Extraction; 3,5 dinitroaniline; amine; aniline derivative; aromatic nitro compound; explosive; glyceryl trinitrate; methacrylic acid; nitramine derivative; oil; organic solvent; peroxide; resin; unclassified drug; explosive; glyceryl trinitrate; peroxide; solvent; Article; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; fused deposition modeling; heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; measurement precision; nuclear magnetic resonance; pH; priority journal; qualitative analysis; soil; solid phase extraction; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; chemistry; high performance liquid chromatography; isolation and purification; mass spectrometry; procedures; solid phase extraction; three dimensional printing; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Explosive Agents; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Limit of Detection; Mass Spectrometry; Methacrylates; Nitroglycerin; Peroxides; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Solid Phase Extraction; Solvents","Barron, L.P.; Department Analytical, 150 Stamford St., United Kingdom; email: leon.barron@imperial.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85092355392,"Nitroaromatic compounds were massively used in the formulation of explosives during both world wars. Even several decades after the end of these wars, their residues are suspected to be widely present in the environment. Their occurrence and effect on ecosystems and human health are still not fully determined. This paper describes the development of a method for the determination of 28 nitroaromatic compounds in water, including isomers of nitrotoluene (NT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitrobenzene (NB), dinitrobenzene (DNB), chloronitrobenzene (ClNB), chlorodinitrobenzene (DNCB), nitronaphthalene (NN), dinitronaphthalene (DNN), nitroaniline (NA), dinitroanisole (DNAN), diphenylamine (DPA), and nitrodiphenylamine (nitro-DPA). In order to separate and individually quantify all the analytes with the best possible sensitivity, stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) was chosen as the extraction and pre-concentration step prior to gas chromatography (GC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry detection (MS/MS). Our SBSE optimization efforts focused on parameters such as the type of stir bar, ionic strength, addition of organic solvent, and extraction and desorption times. After these optimizations, the analytical method enabled us to reach limits of quantification (LOQs) between 1 and 50 ng/L in tap water, groundwater, and surface water. The method was applied to the determination of targeted nitroaromatic explosive residues in spring and groundwater samples collected in an area where mine warfare had raged during World War I. Up to 16 different nitroaromatic compounds were detected in the same sample. The highest concentrations were recorded for 2,4-DNT and 1,3-DNB (1700 and 2690 ng/L respectively). © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Galmiche M., Colin A., Clavos M.-C., Pallez C., Rosin C., Dauchy X.",57219349996;55348407100;57219363886;55348116200;6701904589;16411243700;,Determination of nitroaromatic explosive residues in water by stir bar sorptive extraction-gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,2021,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,413,1,,159,169,NA,16,10.1007/s00216-020-02985-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092355392&doi=10.1007%2fs00216-020-02985-y&partnerID=40&md5=6ad649b2592b27cfdcff7010c96ac00e,"Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France","Galmiche, M., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France; Colin, A., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France; Clavos, M.-C., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France; Pallez, C., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France; Rosin, C., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France; Dauchy, X., Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, Water Chemistry Department, ANSES, 40 Rue Lionnois, Nancy, 54000, France",Explosives; GC; MS/MS; Nitroaromatic; SBSE; Water,Aromatic compounds; Explosives; Gas chromatography; Groundwater; Ionic strength; Isomers; Mass spectrometry; Surface waters; Analytical method; Chloro nitrobenzenes; Gas chromatography separations; Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Nitroaromatic compound; Nitroaromatic explosives; Stir bar sorptive extraction; Tandem mass spectrometry; Extraction,"Dauchy, X.; Nancy Laboratory for Hydrology, 40 Rue Lionnois, France; email: xavier.dauchy@anses.fr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85096837046,"The nitrated compounds 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) are toxic xenobiotics widely used in various industries. They often coexist as environmental contaminants. The aims of this study were to evaluate the transformation of 100 mg L−1 of TNT, 2,4-DNT, and PETN by Raoultella planticola M30b and Rhizobium radiobacter M109c and identify enzymes that may participate in the transformation. These strains were selected from 34 TNT transforming bacteria. Cupriavidus metallidurans DNT was used as a reference strain for comparison purposes. Strains DNT, M30b and M109c transformed 2,4-DNT (100%), TNT (100, 94.7 and 63.6%, respectively), and PETN (72.7, 69.3 and 90.7%, respectively). However, the presence of TNT negatively affects 2,4-DNT and PETN transformation (inhibition > 40%) in strains DNT and M109c and fully inhibited (100% inhibition) 2,4-DNT transformation in R. planticola M30b. Genomes of R. planticola M30b and R. radiobacter M109c were sequenced to identify genes related with 2,4-DNT, TNT or PETN transformation. None of the tested strains presented DNT oxygenase, which has been previously reported in the transformation of 2,4-DNT. Thus, unidentified novel enzymes in these strains are involved in 2,4-DNT transformation. Genes encoding enzymes homologous to the previously reported TNT and PETN-transforming enzymes were identified in both genomes. R. planticola M30b have homologous genes of PETN reductase and xenobiotic reductase B, while R. radiobacter M109c have homologous genes to GTN reductase and PnrA nitroreductase. The ability of these strains to transform explosive mixtures has a potentially biotechnological application in the bioremediation of contaminated environments. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Avellaneda H., Arbeli Z., Teran W., Roldan F.",57194827324;54988830000;6506440960;36081176300;,"Transformation of TNT, 2,4-DNT, and PETN by Raoultella planticola M30b and Rhizobium radiobacter M109 and exploration of the associated enzymes",2020,World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology,36,12,190,,,NA,14,10.1007/s11274-020-02962-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096837046&doi=10.1007%2fs11274-020-02962-8&partnerID=40&md5=0a1b70af06b56abae2ba73a96a2948ac,"Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Unidad de Saneamiento y Biotecnología Ambiental (USBA), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Carrera 7 No. 43-82, Bogotá, DC, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Biología de Plantas y Sistemas Productivos, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia","Avellaneda, H., Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Unidad de Saneamiento y Biotecnología Ambiental (USBA), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Carrera 7 No. 43-82, Bogotá, DC, Colombia; Arbeli, Z., Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Unidad de Saneamiento y Biotecnología Ambiental (USBA), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Carrera 7 No. 43-82, Bogotá, DC, Colombia; Teran, W., Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Biología de Plantas y Sistemas Productivos, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia; Roldan, F., Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología, Unidad de Saneamiento y Biotecnología Ambiental (USBA), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Carrera 7 No. 43-82, Bogotá, DC, Colombia","2,4-dinitrotoluene; Biotransformation; Functional library; Genome sequencing; Pentaeritritol tetranitrate; Trinitrotoluene","Biochemistry; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Enzymes; Genes; Strain; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; 2 ,4-dinitrotoluene; Biotechnological applications; Contaminated environment; Cupriavidus metallidurans; Environmental contaminant; Genes encoding enzymes; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; Explosives; 2,4-dinitrotoluene; nitrobenzene derivative; oxidoreductase; pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase; pentaerythrityl tetranitrate; trinitrotoluene; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; bacterial genome; bioremediation; Enterobacteriaceae; genetics; metabolism; phylogeny; physiology; whole genome sequencing; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Biodegradation, Environmental; Dinitrobenzenes; Enterobacteriaceae; Genome, Bacterial; Oxidoreductases; Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate; Phylogeny; Trinitrotoluene; Whole Genome Sequencing","Roldan, F.; Facultad de Ciencias, Carrera 7 No. 43-82, Colombia; email: fabio.roldan@javeriana.edu.co",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85099066144,"Firework displays produce large amounts of particulate matter (PM), contributing to poor air quality in local areas. Since short-term exposure to particulate matter correlates with increased mortality risks, these celebrations may impact both human health and the environment. Little is known about the particulate matter produced from recreational fireworks, as most studies have focused on professional large-scale events. In New Zealand, it is common for consumer fireworks to be ignited within residential areas during the Guy Fawkes celebration around 5 November. To better understand the contribution of individual fireworks on local air quality, ambient PM10 sampling was conducted in the 10 days surrounding Guy Fawkes Day in Auckland, New Zealand. These data were supplemented with measurements of firework emissions from 11 different individual products, including smoke bombs, sparklers, and Roman candles. Filter sampling results indicated that personal fireworks can contribute to ground level ambient air quality during celebrations, increasing ambient PM10 concentrations by 21.6 μg m−3 over a 12-h sampling period. The use of personal fireworks can expose consumers to PM10 concentrations much higher, up to 9.51 mg m−3 from individual sparkler use under worst-case scenario assumptions. The inhalation of sparkler emissions for just 8 min can lead to an exposure to PM10 mass greater than that from daily recommended limits (50 μg m−3 exposure over 24 h). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis indicated that potassium (K) and strontium (Sr) can be used as tracers for local firework use and that arsenic (As) may be an important contaminant during Guy Fawkes celebrations. The PM from personal fireworks contained large amounts of chlorine (Cl), which may be indicative of perchlorate oxidizers.

Four AIEE active imidazole derivatives with TPA moieties, M-MAP, M01-DMAC, M-IF, and M01-IF, have been developed for the sensitive detection of NAC explosives. The luminescence behaviors of compounds were systematically measured. In 90% THF/H2O, 100-200 nm aggregated nanoparticles were formed with good regularity and stability. The intramolecular free rotations were restricted and emissions were enhanced within the aggregated state. The fluorescence of aqueous AIEE dispersions showed sensitive quenching by picric acid (PA), and the LOD was determined to be 30.99 nM for M-MAP. The intermolecular PIET mechanism was responsible for recognition and sensitive detection. Moreover, their AIEE luminescence behaviors respond weakly to other nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) or analogs. The quenching efficiencies, for M-MAP and M01-MAP, were almost consistent with the risk degrees of NACs. The test strips were easily prepared and the emission quenching effect was simply observed after contacting NACs. The potential of our new AIEEs was demonstrated for the fabrication of convenient and easily operating sensors for NACs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.","Lu S., Fan W., Liu H., Gong L., Xiang Z., Wang H., Yang C.",57195107397;56006588700;57200541755;57208105584;57203281979;57218592099;16065052300;,Four imidazole derivative AIEE luminophores: sensitive detection of NAC explosives,2021,New Journal of Chemistry,45,15,,6889,6894,NA,10,10.1039/d0nj06007k,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104293971&doi=10.1039%2fd0nj06007k&partnerID=40&md5=35591bb6b57e5ce99c7fc192ac1348a6,"College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China","Lu, S., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Fan, W., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Liu, H., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Gong, L., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Xiang, Z., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Wang, H., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China; Yang, C., College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China",,Aromatic compounds; Explosives; Luminescence; Quenching; Aggregationinduced emission enhancement (AIEE); Almost consistent; Emission quenching; Imidazole derivatives; Luminescent material; Nitroaromatic compound; Quenching efficiency; Sensitive detection; Explosives detection; aldehyde derivative; aromatic nitro compound; explosive; imidazole derivative; nanoparticle; picric acid; aqueous solution; Article; dispersion; fluorescence; Knoevenagel condensation; limit of detection; nanofabrication; photoluminescence; priority journal; quorum quenching,"Yang, C.; College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Science, China; email: changying.yang@ctgu.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85089471480,"Stand-off chemical sensing is an important capability with applications in several domains including homeland security. Engineered devices for this task, popularly referred to as electronic noses, have limited capacity compared to the broad-spectrum abilities of the biological olfactory system. Therefore, we propose a hybrid bio-electronic solution that directly takes advantage of the rich repertoire of olfactory sensors and sophisticated neural computational framework available in an insect olfactory system. We show that select subsets of neurons in the locust (Schistocerca americana) brain were activated upon exposure to various explosive chemical species (such as DNT and TNT). Responses from an ensemble of neurons provided a unique, multivariate fingerprint that allowed discrimination of explosive vapors from non-explosive chemical species and from each other. Notably, target chemical recognition could be achieved within a few hundred milliseconds of exposure. In sum, our study provides the first demonstration of how biological olfactory systems (sensors and computations) can be hijacked to develop a cyborg chemical sensing approach. © 2020 The Authors","Saha D., Mehta D., Altan E., Chandak R., Traner M., Lo R., Gupta P., Singamaneni S., Chakrabartty S., Raman B.",36560295100;57196344710;57208065316;57196327378;57218545687;57194381008;57211254305;6505829971;15080579100;57203080998;,Explosive sensing with insect-based biorobots,2020,Biosensors and Bioelectronics: X,6,,100050,,,NA,29,10.1016/j.biosx.2020.100050,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089471480&doi=10.1016%2fj.biosx.2020.100050&partnerID=40&md5=e540f14df775b743fe3388b44b7a5bc5,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Science, Washington University in St. Louis, United States","Saha, D., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Mehta, D., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Altan, E., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Chandak, R., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Traner, M., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Lo, R., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Gupta, P., Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Science, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Singamaneni, S., Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Science, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Chakrabartty, S., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States, Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States; Raman, B., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States, Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States",Chemical sensing; Explosives detection; Insect-based machine olfaction; Neural engineering; Neural signals; Pattern recognition,Electrochemical sensors; Electronic nose; Chemical recognition; Chemical sensing; Computational framework; Engineered devices; Explosive chemicals; Explosive vapors; Limited capacity; Olfactory systems; Explosives; Acrididae; antenna (organ); Article; controlled study; insect based biorobot; minimally invasive surgery; molecular recognition; nerve cell; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; olfactory system; Schistocerca americana; surgical approach; vapor,"Raman, B.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, United States; email: barani@wustl.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85099568519,"This paper reviews the ballistic properties, stability and vulnerability of gun propellants, gas generators and rocket propellants containing nitroguanidine (NGu), CAS−No [556-88-7] as an energetic filler. Nitroguanidine and its formulations burn stable over a broad pressure regime extending from subatmospheric to high pressures (0.1 kPa–400 MPa). Its high nitrogen content (53.83 %) and oxygen balance (Ω=-30.75 %) effects a high gas pressure in gun propellants combined with low explosion temperature and consequently low signature and reduced erosion. NGu is an effective stabilizer for a broad array of energetic materials encountered in gun and rocket propellants including AP, ADN, HMX, RDX, NGl and also materials with low thermal stability such as NC, HNF, TNAZ and ADN. Finally, the low vulnerability of NGu-based propellant formulations makes them taylor made to serve insensitive munitions. This review covers 31 NGu-based rocket and gas generating propellant formulations, 44 gun propellants, five of which contain guanylurea dinitramide, (GuDN, FOX-12), CAS−No [217464-38-5] for comparison, four reference propellants containing neither of the aforementioned ingredients and six combustible cartridge case formulations based on NGu. In addition, the combustion properties of pure NGu, pure GUDN and NGu modified with 17 different catalysts are revised.

2-s2.0-85093509003,"The unchecked dispersal of antipersonnel landmines since the late 19th century has resulted in large areas contaminated with these explosive devices, creating a substantial worldwide humanitarian safety risk. The main obstacle to safe and effective landmine removal is the identification of their exact location, an activity that currently requires entry of personnel into the minefields; to date, there is no commercialized technology for an efficient stand-off detection of buried landmines. In this article, we describe the optimization of a microbial sensor strain, genetically engineered for the remote detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoloune (TNT)-based mines. This bioreporter, designed to bioluminescence in response to minute concentrations of either TNT or 2,4-dinitotoluene (DNT), was immobilized in hydrogel beads and optimized for dispersion over the minefield. Following modifications of the hydrogel matrix in which the sensor bacteria are encapsulated, as well as their genetic reporting elements, these sensor bacteria sensitively detected buried 2,4-dinitrotoluene in laboratory experiments. Encapsulated in 1.5 mm 2% alginate beads containing 1% polyacrylic acid, they also detected the location of a real metallic antipersonnel landmine under field conditions.

2-s2.0-85089265902,"Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis is a nuclear-based technique that can be used in explosives detection. It relies on bombarding unknown samples with neutrons emitted from a neutron source. These neutrons interact with the sample nuclei emitting the gamma spectrum with peaks at specific energies, which are considered a fingerprint for the sample composition. Analyzing these peaks heights will give information about the unknown sample material composition. Shielding the sample from gamma rays or neutrons will affect the gamma spectrum obtained to be analyzed, providing a false indication about the sample constituents, especially when the shield is unknown. Here we show how using deep neural networks can solve the shielding drawback associated with the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis technique in explosives detection. We found that the introduced end-to-end framework was capable of differentiating between explosive and non-explosive hydrocarbons with accuracy of 95% for the previously included explosives in the model development data set. It was also, capable of generalizing with accuracy 80% over the explosives which were not included in the model development data set.

2-s2.0-85099366725,"There is a consensus that humans, rodents, and primates process odor mixtures configurally: that is, the mixture is perceived as a unique whole and not as a collection of its different components. However, it is commonly believed by dog trainers that dogs can analyze mixtures and break them down into their individual components: that is, that they process odor mixtures analytically. There is, however, little experimental evidence to support this belief. This experiment was designed to determine whether dogs trained on mixtures of three or five different odors would detect the individual odors when each component was tested. Our results show that the dogs were able to respond to each of the components on their first trial with each separate element of the mixture (p < 0.001). This finding presents the first experimental proof that dogs trained to detect a mixture will later detect its individual components.

2-s2.0-85095993614,"Common methods of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection are based on direct detection to the concentration of TNT. If TNT can be accumulated first to increase partial concentration near the sensor and detected by sensing materials then, the detection performance can be significantly improved. As we know, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is widely used as the sensing mechanism in TNT detection, which has an effective range of 10 nm. Based on this, we built an accumulation layer between sensing materials and TNT within effective range of FRET, where exists a large quantity of amino groups. The Amino groups can adsorb TNT and realize accumulation function. The accumulation and sensing layer played different roles in the detection of TNT based on distinct mechanism. Accumulation layer was realized by forming Meisenheimer complex between TNT and amino groups while sensing layer was realized by FRET. Via both two layers and mechanisms, the sensors achieved ultra-high sensitivity to TNT, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.6 nM and a linear range of 1–20 nM. Compared with pure graphene quantum dots (GQDs), the KSV of sensor in this work to TNT increased for about 14 times.

2-s2.0-85089350253,"The laser-ablated reaction process of two aluminized cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX) explosives with additives is presented, one formulation is RDX/aluminum (Al) /ammonium perchlorate (AP) and named AH, the other is RDX/Al/AP/Boron (B)/magnesium hydride (MgH2) and named BH. Laser ablation combined with a high-speed photography and an emission spectrometer in this paper provides a high time-resolution observation of the reaction process of energetic materials in laboratory scale. A sample plate with an array of cylindrical holes was used to load the explosive powders for high-throughput studies, and a complete fresh sample was ablated each time to ensure the consistency of the sample status. From the laser-ablated images, AH exhibits a longer combustion duration than aluminized RDX with no additional additives, and BH has an even longer combustion duration than AH. Both AH and BH show a monotonic decreasing trend in luminous intensities, but AH has higher intensities than BH from 3 to 30 µs. In addition to the observation of AlO molecular emission lines in the spectra of AH and BH, neutral magnesium (Mg I) emission lines were observed in the spectra of BH. The spectral distribution with time indicates that the oxidation reaction of Al is the main reason leading to persistent combustion in AH and BH. Overall analysis directly reveals that AP promotes the combustion of AH and makes the afterburning of Al with ambient air less significant, and B/MgH2 prolongs the combustion duration of BH. © 2020","Cao W., Guo W., Ding T., Han Y., Li M., Gao D., Guo X.",56391343800;35793754300;57207989219;55387642200;56994218000;55163130400;56714210800;,Laser ablation of aluminized RDX with added ammonium perchlorate or ammonium perchlorate/boron/magnesium hydride,2020,Combustion and Flame,221,,,194,200,NA,17,10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.07.045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089350253&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2020.07.045&partnerID=40&md5=ffa230b536af295085503441a854a87f,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China","Cao, W., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Guo, W., Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Ding, T., Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Han, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Li, M., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Gao, D., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Guo, X., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China",Aluminized RDX; Ammonium perchlorate; Boron; Emission spectrum; Laser ablation; Magnesium hydride,Ablation; Additives; Aluminum compounds; Combustion; Electromagnetic wave emission; Explosives; High speed photography; Hydrides; Laser ablation; Magnesium compounds; Ammonium perchlorates; Cyclotrimethylene trinitramine; Emission spectrometers; High throughput studies; High-time-resolution observations; Molecular emissions; Oxidation reactions; Spectral distribution; Laser materials processing; aluminum; ammonium perchlorate; boron; cyclonite; explosive; magnesium; magnesium hydride; unclassified drug; ambient air; Article; atomic emission spectrometry; combustion; laboratory; laser surgery; light intensity; luminance; oxidation; photography; priority journal; reaction analysis; scanning electron microscopy,"Han, Y.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: hanyong@caep.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85099120719,"Swabs taken from the surface of a suspicious object are a standard method of identifying a concealed explosive device in security-conscious locations like airports. In this paper we demonstrate a sensitive method to collect and detect trace explosive residues from improvised explosive devices using swabs and an optical sensor element. Swabs coated with a commercial fluoropolymer are used to collect material and are subsequently heated to thermally desorb the explosives, causing the quenching of light emission from a thin film luminescent sensor.

Exploring low-sensitive nitroamine explosives is meaningful since explosives have helped to reduce labor costs and enhanced production efficiency greatly.

2-s2.0-85099230214,"Ammonium nitrate (AN) is widely used as a raw material in industry and agriculture. However, the Beirut explosion in Lebanon once again shows that AN has a risk of thermal runaway during storage, especially long-term storage or when some possible substances are mixed therein. This paper focuses on the effect of halides additives, such as sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide and sodium iodide, on the thermal decomposition products and energy release of AN. Especially, the thermal decomposition of AN added with 5% sodium halide and the evolved gases in the thermal decomposition process are investigated by C80 microcalorimetry and FTIR. The results show that all kinds of sodium halides have an effect on the thermal decomposition of AN, although these effects are different. The addition of the halide not only changes the timing of the formation of the AN thermal decomposition characteristic product, but also reduces the heat of the reaction. Combined with optimized kinetic parameters, the engineering prediction of thermal safety was carried out for each type of sample. It is found that sodium iodide is beneficial to the safety of large-scale storage of AN. The research results can provide a reference and guidance for revealing the thermal decomposition mechanism of halide-containing AN and thermal decomposition simulation of AN with additives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cao H.-Q., Li X.-X., Jin K.-Q., Duan Q.-L., Chai H., Sun J.-H.",57202609769;57211140457;57189582480;55747538000;58822250800;55632797300;,Experimental and theoretical study of the effect of typical halides on thermal decomposition products and energy release of ammonium nitrate based on microcalorimetry and FTIR,2021,Chemical Engineering Journal,410,,128405,,,NA,12,10.1016/j.cej.2021.128405,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099230214&doi=10.1016%2fj.cej.2021.128405&partnerID=40&md5=ada372fdaa2f28f45b14729e391230fe,"State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China","Cao, H.-Q., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China; Li, X.-X., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China; Jin, K.-Q., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China; Duan, Q.-L., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China; Chai, H., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China; Sun, J.-H., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui  230027, China",Ammonium nitrate; Engineering prediction; Evolved gases; Sodium halide; Thermal safety,Additives; Agricultural robots; Calorimeters; Explosions; Iodine compounds; Nitrates; Sodium chloride; Sodium Fluoride; Sodium Iodide; Storage (materials); Thermal Engineering; Thermolysis; Decomposition characteristics; Engineering prediction; Long-term storage; Micro-calorimetry; Theoretical study; Thermal decomposition mechanism; Thermal decomposition process; Thermal decomposition products; Decomposition,"Duan, Q.-L.; State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, China; email: duanql@ustc.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85096013112,"There is a recognized need in the area of explosives detection for fluorescence-based sensing systems that are capable of not only producing a turn-on response but also generating a distinctive spectral signature for a given analyte. Here, we report several supramolecular ensembles displaying efficient fluorophore displacement that give rise to an increase in fluorescence intensity upon exposure to various nitroaromatic compounds. The synthetic supramolecular constructs in question consist of a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based pyrrolic macrocycle, benzo-TTF-calix[4]pyrrole (Bz-TTF-C4P), and fluorescent dyes, monomeric or dimeric naphthalenediimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives, as well as chloride or hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) salts of rhodamine 6G (Rh-6G). In chloroform solution, these assemblies exist in the form of discrete supramolecular complexes or oligomeric aggregates depending on the specific dye combinations in question. Each ensemble was tested as a potential explosive-responsive fluorescence indicator displacement assay (FIDA) by challenging it with a series of di- and trinitroaromatic compounds and examining the change in fluorescence spectral characteristics. Upon addition of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), either a """"turn-on""""or a """"turn-off""""fluorescent response was observed depending on the nature of the constituent fluorophore and, where applicable, the counteranion. The FIDAs based on the PDI derivatives were found to display not only a ratiometric fluorescence enhancement but also analyte-dependent spectral changes when treated with NACs.

Results: The isolate exhibited 88% degradation of RDX in 30 days of incubation. The biodegradation process followed the first order kinetics. The half- life of RDX was calculated to be 11.088 days. The RDX degradation process was complemented by concomitant release of nitrite ions with 0.78 mol of nitrite released per mole of RDX. The metabolites; Trinitroso- RDX, diamino-RDX, trimino-RDX, bis- (hydroxymethyl) nitramine and methylenedintramine derivative, viz, methylene- N- (hydroxy- methyl)- hydroxylamine- N-(hydroxymethyl) nitroamine corresponding to the molecular weights 174, 162, 132, 122 and 167 Da respectively were also detected.

2-s2.0-85084381577,"Ammonium nitrate (AN, NH4NO3) remains classified as an oxidising agent for transport, storage and handling purposes. The safe use of ammonium nitrate requires strict procedures as AN is incompatible with many materials. This study investigates the thermal decomposition of AN on surfaces of rust, potentially present on steel in storage facilities of AN. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction served to characterise the mineralogy of the rust, relatively to neat iron (III) oxide. Furthermore, simultaneous thermogravimetric measurements and differential scanning calorimetry afforded the isoconversional analysis that yields the activation energies of the decomposition process. The results, in conjunction with the molecular modelling involving oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 clusters, elucidate the effect of rusts, existing on the surface of corroded steel, in reducing the ignition temperature of AN. This process manifests itself by lowering the activation energies of the initiation channels of the decomposition reactions. On the contrary, pure Fe2O3 does not influence the decomposition of AN. The dehydroxylation of hydrated iron (III) oxide, present on surfaces of rust, exposes the Fe sites that react exothermically with AN, before the material assumes the ordered Fe2O3 phase. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Oluwoye I., Mosallanejad S., Soubans G., Altarawneh M., Gore J., Dlugogorski B.Z.",56728921600;55873645500;57216731530;57205849510;56385013300;7006822192;,Thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate on rust surface: Risk of low-temperature fire,2021,Fire Safety Journal,120,,103063,,,NA,10,10.1016/j.firesaf.2020.103063,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084381577&doi=10.1016%2fj.firesaf.2020.103063&partnerID=40&md5=150546420329519a8d3a9bf73d0c2ea0,"Murdoch University, Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia; United Arab Emirates University, Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed St, Al-Ain, 15551, United Arab Emirates; Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia; Charles Darwin University, Energy and Resources Institute, Ellengowan Drive, Darwin, NT  0909, Australia","Oluwoye, I., Murdoch University, Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia; Mosallanejad, S., Murdoch University, Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia; Soubans, G., Murdoch University, Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia; Altarawneh, M., United Arab Emirates University, Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed St, Al-Ain, 15551, United Arab Emirates; Gore, J., Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia; Dlugogorski, B.Z., Charles Darwin University, Energy and Resources Institute, Ellengowan Drive, Darwin, NT  0909, Australia",Ammonium nitrate; Explosion; Rust; Self-heating; Steel,Activation analysis; Differential scanning calorimetry; Hematite; Infrared spectroscopy; Molecular oxygen; Nitrates; Steel corrosion; Temperature; Thermogravimetric analysis; Thermolysis; Classifieds; Infrared: spectroscopy; Iron(III) oxide; Lows-temperatures; Oxidizing agents; Rust; Self-heating; Storage and handling; Storage facilities; X- ray diffractions; Activation energy,"Dlugogorski, B.Z.; Charles Darwin University, Ellengowan Drive, Australia; email: Bogdan.Dlugogorski@cdu.edu.au",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85096239066,"Entities throughout the world face the problem of detecting hidden explosives, where human and canine inspection might not be a viable solution. Therefore, it is important to develop fast, reliable, and portable integrated inspection systems by means of automated methods, such as electronic noses. The goal of the work presented here is to develop an accurate, fast and light-weight machine/deep learning classification model to be used in a MOX chemical sensors array (electronic nose), in order to identify explosive substances. For this paper, 140 samples were taken, combining TNT or gunpowder with either soap or toothpaste, or acquiring raw samples of those substances in amounts ranging from 0.1 g to 2 g. For the classification problem, among the different options in machine learning techniques, five models were evaluated. The implemented LSTM version of a LeNet-5 based network, classifies accurately the compounds in 100% of the cases when using only 30 seconds from the 360 obtained by the sensor array per each sample. The results of this work indicate that the proposed LSTM-based deep learning model could be easily implemented into an embedded system. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Torres-Tello J., Guaman A.V., Ko S.-B.",57195294967;36961115600;57918890700;,Improving the Detection of Explosives in a MOX Chemical Sensors Array with LSTM Networks,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,20,23,9133565,14302,14309,NA,18,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3007431,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096239066&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2020.3007431&partnerID=40&md5=74aeb12ba596f31d55e8775562555f0e,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; Departamento de Electrica y Electronica, Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador","Torres-Tello, J., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, Departamento de Electrica y Electronica, Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador; Guaman, A.V., Departamento de Electrica y Electronica, Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador; Ko, S.-B., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",classification; deep learning; Electronic nose; explosives; fast detection; machine learning; sensor arrays,Deep learning; Electronic equipment; Electronic nose; Explosives; Explosives detection; Learning systems; Sensor arrays; Automated methods; Classification models; Detection of explosives; Explosive substances; Inspection system; Learning models; Machine learning techniques; Viable solutions; Long short-term memory,"Ko, S.-B.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Canada; email: seokbum.ko@usask.ca",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85099415706,"The effects of micro-encapsulation technology on the thermal safety of boron-containing emulsion explosives were experimentally studied. Micro-structures of additives, demulsification states and thermal characteristics of boron-containing emulsion explosives were characterized by the laser particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope and thermal analysis equipment, respectively. The storage experiments showed that emulsion explosives with boron powders would be demulsified in a short time, while those with micro-encapsulated boron powders were not demulsified and had good surface morphologies and structures. The results of TG-DSC experiments showed that the thermal stability of emulsion explosive with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) micro-encapsulated boron powders was higher than that of other samples with boron powders, and the order of thermal stability was as follows: PMMA/Boron sensitized emulsion explosive > Paraffin/Boron-Glass microspheres (GMs) sensitized emulsion explosive > Boron-GMs sensitized emulsion explosive. The experimental data of accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests showed that the addition of boron powders would significantly increase the risk of thermal explosion of emulsion explosives under the adiabatic condition, and PMMA micro-encapsulation for boron powders could largely reduce the thermal explosion risk of boron-containing emulsion explosives compared with paraffin coating. The coating effect of micro-encapsulation technology was much better than that of traditional paraffin coating method, and the compatibility and thermal safety of boron-containing emulsion explosives were also improved. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Yao Y.-L., Cheng Y.-F., Liu R., Hu F.-F., Zhang Q.-W., Xia Y., Chen Y.",57211468483;55653988300;55759367100;57219220878;57219231487;57221540387;57214882420;,Effects of Micro-Encapsulation Treatment on the Thermal Safety of High Energy Emulsion Explosives with Boron Powders,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,3,,389,397,NA,12,10.1002/prep.202000130,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099415706&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000130&partnerID=40&md5=6bb48014680f62a2d4844a2b673dcf88,"State Key Laboratory of Mining Response and Disaster Prevention and Control in Deep Coal Mines, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Quality Department, The 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Hefei, 230088, China","Yao, Y.-L., State Key Laboratory of Mining Response and Disaster Prevention and Control in Deep Coal Mines, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China, School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Cheng, Y.-F., State Key Laboratory of Mining Response and Disaster Prevention and Control in Deep Coal Mines, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China, School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Liu, R., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Hu, F.-F., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Zhang, Q.-W., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Xia, Y., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China; Chen, Y., Quality Department, The 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Hefei, 230088, China",Boron powder; Emulsion explosive; Micro-capsule; Stability; Thermal safety,Additives; Coatings; Data encapsulation; Digital storage; Emulsification; Explosions; Explosives; Microencapsulation; Paraffins; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Polymethyl methacrylates; Powders; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic stability; Accelerating rate calorimeter; Adiabatic conditions; Analysis equipments; Boron-containing; Emulsion explosives; Laser particle size analyzer; Thermal characteristics; Thermal explosion; Boron,"Cheng, Y.-F.; State Key Laboratory of Mining Response and Disaster Prevention and Control in Deep Coal Mines, China; email: cyf518@mail.ustc.edu.cn

2-s2.0-85105499676,"Given the constraints on typical bond energies and the commonality of final products produced from combustion of C-H-N-O based energetic materials, the possibilities for further increases in stored potential energy and thermodynamic performance from these classes of materials are limited. Thus, modulating the energy release to achieve efficiency and effectiveness for desired applications is of great value. Investigation of nanomaterials as energetic materials began more than twenty years ago with much of the interest to increase reaction rates and reduce sensitivity. During this period, research on energetic nanoparticles was devoted to reducing the loss of energy density with metallic materials due to the naturally occurring oxide passivating layer, managing their high surface area preventing high loadings in solids, minimizing particle-particle interactions making dispersion in the gas-phase difficult, and understanding combustion mechanisms. As an outcome, novel synthesis methods of producing nanocomposites, and new fields of applications, such as micro-pyrotechnics, have developed. Yet, the research community is only beginning to understand how to manipulate and build energetic materials at the nanoscale, and what designs are optimal for desired functions. Furthermore, recognizing the difficulties for increased energy density and reduced sensitivity, the development of multifunctional and smart nanoenergetic materials is currently being researched to enable control of energy release rates and material sensitivity on demand. This research is being advanced by assembly of nanoengineered energetic materials to bulk scales by additive manufacturing, the development and application of combustion diagnostics that resolve nanometer and micron scales, and ab initio quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations.

2-s2.0-85089354281,"Explosives are among one of the most important components of a military system, and old explosives must be disposed safely and cleanly. Several explosive waste disposal methods have been developed, especially rotary kilns. Although using rotary kilns is better than other methods, problems like NOx emissions still exist. Thus a need of new and more efficient type of incinerator is required. Since fluidized bed reactors are well known for effective heat transfer and well mixed conditions, they have been proposed as an advanced incinerator. In this study, fluidized bed was simulated in CFD (computational fluid dynamics) program. The objective was finding the conditions that produced the lowest NOx emissions. By the CFD simulation, it was found that the change in inlet gas affects hot spot generation, and hot spot temperature is closely related to NOx emissions. As a result, the model was optimized through these characteristics and CFD simulation data. © 2020","Cho S., Park C., Lee J., Lyu B., Moon I.",57191863816;55728043200;57199059560;56221988500;8907775200;,Finding the best operating condition in a novel process for explosive waste incineration using fluidized bed reactors,2020,Computers and Chemical Engineering,142,,107054,,,NA,17,10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.107054,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089354281&doi=10.1016%2fj.compchemeng.2020.107054&partnerID=40&md5=a332b16fc2a755658168ccb67b046ba2,"Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul  03722, South Korea; Process Development Research Team, Hanwha-Total, 103 Dokgot2-ro, Daesan-eup, Seosan-si, Chungnam  31900, South Korea; Petrochemicals R&D, LG Chem, 188 Munji-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon  34122, South Korea","Cho, S., Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul  03722, South Korea; Park, C., Process Development Research Team, Hanwha-Total, 103 Dokgot2-ro, Daesan-eup, Seosan-si, Chungnam  31900, South Korea; Lee, J., Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul  03722, South Korea; Lyu, B., Petrochemicals R&D, LG Chem, 188 Munji-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon  34122, South Korea; Moon, I., Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul  03722, South Korea",CFD; Emissions; Explosive waste; Fluidized bed; Incineration; NOX,Brickmaking; Chemical reactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Explosives; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized bed process; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; Nitrogen oxides; Rotary kilns; Supersaturation; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; CFD (computational fluid dynamics); CFD simulations; Disposal methods; Fluidized bed reactors; Hotspot temperature; Military systems; NOx emissions; Operating condition; Fluidized beds,"Moon, I.; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, 50 Yonsei-ro, South Korea; email: ilmoon@yonsei.ac.kr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Future advances and realization of these tiny devices are mostly limited by the narrow window of material choices, the fuel requirement, multistep surface functionalization, rational structural design, and propulsion ability in complex environments. All these aspects call for intensive improvements that may speed up the real application of such miniaturized robots. 3D-printed graphene-based smartdust robots provided with a magnetic response and filled with aluminum/gallium molten alloy (Al/Ga) for autonomous motion are presented. These robots can swim by reacting with the surrounding environment without adding any fuel.

The results show a fast and efficient degradation of picric acid that is attributed to a synergistic effect between the adsorption capability of the chitosan and the photocatalytic activity of C3N4 particles.

These methods allow the exploration of the evolved gases during the thermal decomposition, which let to trace back the chemical decomposition mechanisms and allows better control of the thermal behavior of various energetic formulations.

This approach incorporates a shielding layer, as part of the flexible PCB design, and represents the minimum dimensional footprint conceivable for a DT. The low thermal mass of the polyimide substrate and overlapping electrodes, as afforded by the dog-leg design, allow for efficient heat management and high field linearity within the tube-achieved from a single PCB. This is further enhanced by a novel double-glazing configuration which provides a simple and effective means for gas management, minimizing thermal variation within the assembly.

Here, a new strategy based on vertically aligned ZnO arrays is employed for the large-scale and template-free fabrication of self-propelled ZnO-based micromotors with H2O2-free light-driven propulsion ability. Brush-shaped ZnO-based micromotors with different diameters and lengths are fully studied, which present a fast response to multicycles UV light on/off switches with different interval times (2/5 s) in pure water and slow directional motion in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in the absence of UV light. Light-induced electrophoretic and self-diffusiophoretic effects are responsible for these two different self-motion behaviors under different conditions, respectively. In addition, the pH of the media and the presence of H2O2 show important effects on the motion behavior and microstructure of the ZnO-based micromotors. Finally, these novel ZnO-based brush-shaped micromotors are demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study on nitroaromatic explosive degradation, i.e., picric acid. This work opens a completely new avenue for the template-free fabrication of brush-shaped light-responsive micromotors on a large scale based on vertically aligned ZnO arrays. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85078477357,"The laser initiation of secondary explosives presents tactical, safety and environmental advantages over traditional ignition systems utilising primary explosives. In this paper, direct ignition or initiation by pulsed laser was investigated of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) crystals doped with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for the first time. A nano-seconds pulsed laser was used for direct irradiation of the crystals at the GNP's surface-plasmon-resonance wavelength of 532 nm. RDX crystals were recrystallised from a solution containing GNPs and characterised by visual microscopy for surface coating and subsurface doping. A high-speed camera was used to observe and capture the modes of interaction between the GNPs-doped RDX crystals and pulsed laser irradiation with a new classification method. Laser fluence thresholds for ignition and initiation were established. The GNPs sensitized RDX to pulsed laser irradiation at this selected wavelength is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than pure RDX. Direct initiation of the GNPs doped RDX crystal at laser fluence of 0.04 J/cm2 led to the total consumption of a crystal sample, which was unreproducible with pure RDX. The results show that GNPs are effective optical sensitizers for direct initiation of RDX crystal by low-power pulsed laser. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Fang X., Stone M., Stennett C.",10440310400;57214223059;23973443000;,Pulsed laser irradiation of a nanoparticles sensitised RDX crystal,2020,Combustion and Flame,214,,,387,393,NA,11,10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.01.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078477357&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2020.01.009&partnerID=40&md5=368dae427a4b4b9d6c70b4f5b8a0b58b,"Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the UK, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom","Fang, X., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the UK, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Stone, M., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the UK, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Stennett, C., Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the UK, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom",Explosive; Gold nanoparticles; Laser ignition; Pulsed laser,Doping (additives); Explosives; Fiber optic sensors; Gold nanoparticles; High speed cameras; Initiators (explosives); Irradiation; Laser safety; Metal nanoparticles; Surface plasmon resonance; Classification methods; Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX); Direct initiations; Direct irradiation; Gold nanoparticles (GNPs); Laser ignition; Orders of magnitude; Secondary explosive; Pulsed lasers; carbon; carboxylic acid; cyclonite; gold nanoparticle; absorption; Article; combustion; crystal; electromagnetism; evaporation; microscopy; priority journal; surface plasmon resonance,"Fang, X.; Centre for Defence Chemistry, United Kingdom; email: x.fang@cranfield.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85081673651,"Crystal structure prediction and characterization data have been computed for two novel carbon-free energetic compounds, namely 1,4,2,3,5,6-dioxatetrazinane (DOTZ) and its 2,5-dinitro derivative (DNDOTZ). Dynamic and mechanical stability of these crystalline materials at ambient pressure has been confirmed. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirmed thermal stability of DOTZ at 298 K and of DNDOTZ at 77 K. A comprehensive spectral characterization (IR, Raman, UV/Vis, NMR) has been performed to provide information for future experimental identification. The parent molecule exhibits powerful detonation properties, which exceed those of most compounds hitherto obtained experimentally or predicted theoretically. Meanwhile, DNDOTZ is predicted to be an effective solid oxidant for common explosives with negative oxygen balance, such as TNT, TNB, DATB, and TATB. Such mixtures demonstrate better propulsive properties than corresponding mixtures of these explosives with gaseous oxygen. By virtue of its zero oxygen balance, the only detonation products of DOTZ are environmentally friendly molecular nitrogen and water.

2-s2.0-85078398962,"A newly parameterized reactive force field with low gradient correction (ReaxFF-lg) is used to simulate the thermal decomposition of RDX systems. Pure Al, surface nitrided Al (AlN) and surface oxidized Al (AlO) particles are constructed to mix with RDX. The simulation results indicate that the decomposition mechanism of pure RDX is the elimination of HONO in the initial stage and the elimination of -NO2 in the later stage. The mechanism is further testified by the density functional calculation. RDX molecule adsorbs on the surface of Al particles to form N[sbnd]Al and O[sbnd]Al bonds. N[sbnd]O bond ruptures is the main decomposition ways of aluminiferous RDX in the initial stage. The decompositions of RDX and RDX/AlO need to overcome 2.00 kJ/g and 0.31 kJ/g energy barrier, respectively. However, there are no energy barriers in RDX/Al and RDX/AlN decomposition processes. Aluminiferous RDX decomposition depends on the strong attraction of Al to N and O. Alumina layer blocks the attraction of Al to O and N in RDX, causing the reactivity of AlO declines significantly. However, the Al-nitride layer hardly has such blocking effect, resulting AlN maintains the reactivity of Al. © 2020","Zhao Y., Zhao F.-Q., Xu S.-Y., Ju X.-H.",57207937353;36041628300;14016934300;7006676590;,Molecular reaction dynamics simulation of thermal decomposition for aluminiferous RDX composites,2020,Computational Materials Science,177,,109556,,,NA,21,10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078398962&doi=10.1016%2fj.commatsci.2020.109556&partnerID=40&md5=1fa053be0d2e1de128168130ab7eca2f,"Key Laboratory of Soft Chemistry and Functional Materials of MOE, School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xian Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xian, 710065, China","Zhao, Y., Key Laboratory of Soft Chemistry and Functional Materials of MOE, School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Zhao, F.-Q., Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xian Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xian, 710065, China; Xu, S.-Y., Science and Technology on Combustion and Explosion Laboratory, Xian Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xian, 710065, China; Ju, X.-H., Key Laboratory of Soft Chemistry and Functional Materials of MOE, School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China",Decomposition mechanism; Diffusion coefficient; Product analysis; ReaxFF-lg,Alumina; Aluminum nitride; Aluminum oxide; Diffusion; Energy barriers; III-V semiconductors; Thermolysis; Blocking effect; Decomposition mechanism; Decomposition process; Molecular reaction dynamics; Nitride layers; Product analysis; Reactive force field; ReaxFF-lg; Decomposition,"Ju, X.-H.; Key Laboratory of Soft Chemistry and Functional Materials of MOE, China; email: xhju@njust.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

They are low cost, photostable, and strongly photoluminescent materials, but so far have been little studied for sensing. In this article, we explore hybrid perovskites as sensors for explosive vapor. We tune the dimensionality of perovskite films in order to modify their exciton binding energy and film morphology and explore the effect on sensing response. We find that tuning from the 3D to the 0D regime increases the PL quenching response of perovskite films to the vapor of dinitrotoluene (DNT)-a molecule commonly found in landmines. We find that films of 0D perovskite nanocrystals work as sensitive and stable sensors, with strong PL responses to DNT molecules at concentrations in the parts per billion range. The PL quenching response can easily be reversed, making the sensors reusable. We compare the response to several explosive vapors and find that the response is strongest for DNT.

To overcome this challenge, an artificial olfactory system based on a colorimetric hydrogel array is constructed for the first time as a universal representative. As an effective extension of conventional artificial olfactory systems that integrates the merits of its predecessors, the proposed system accurately mimics olfactory mucosa and specific odorant binding proteins using hydrogels endowed with specific colorimetric reagents for the detection of hypochlorite, chlorate, perchlorate, urea, and nitrate. Therefore, the proposed system is capable of detecting and discriminating between these five airborne improvised explosive microparticulates with a detection limit as low as 39.4 pg.

2-s2.0-85082201410,"A simple and robust, low-cost electrochemical device is proposed for the combined sampling and detection of the trace solid explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from a non-porous surface. Four different substrates were investigated to collect explosive residue – a bare thin-film electrode, glass microfiber filter paper, a gel-polymer electrolyte (GPE), and a GPE-filter paper composite. The GPE contained the hydrophobic room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([P14,6,6,6][NTf2]) and the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). A simple “swabbing” technique was used to sample explosive residue on all substrates. Square wave voltammetry was performed to determine the effects of oxygen and moisture on the current response. The most robust method for use in the field – a GPE drop-casted on a TFE – was applied in real environments using a hand-held portable potentiostat. The prototype device was able to detect TNT with a 30 min development time in different ambient environmental conditions. The portability, ease of use and low-cost of the sensor device makes this a viable platform for the rapid onsite detection of explosives. © 2020","Hay C.E., Lee J., Silvester D.S.",57203850638;52663829800;14623139100;,A methodology to detect explosive residues using a gelled ionic liquid based field-deployable electrochemical device,2020,Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,872,,114046,,,NA,11,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114046,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082201410&doi=10.1016%2fj.jelechem.2020.114046&partnerID=40&md5=b77eab58d6011562c3fae59201097351,"Curtin Institute for Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia","Hay, C.E., Curtin Institute for Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia; Lee, J., Curtin Institute for Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia; Silvester, D.S., Curtin Institute for Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia","2,4,6-trinitrotoluene; Detection; Electrochemistry; Explosives; Planar device; Sensing; Square wave voltammetry; TNT","Costs; Electrochemical devices; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemistry; Error detection; Esters; Explosives; Ionic liquids; Polyelectrolytes; Voltage regulators; Voltammetry; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Glass micro-fiber filters; Planar devices; Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); Room temperature ionic liquids; Sensing; Square wave voltammetry; Trihexyltetradecylphosphonium; Explosives detection","Lee, J.; Curtin Institute for Functional Molecules and Interfaces, GPO Box U1987, Australia; email: junqiaolee81@gmail.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Two laboratory tests have been developed to determine the reaction violence of these materials. The first test was the Combustion Rate Analysis of a Slowly Heated Propellant (CRASH-P) test, which used dynamic pressure sensors to quantify the violence of the reaction. The second test used x-rays to measure physical changes in the propellants before ignition and their reaction violence through the deformation speed of the sample container. For this study, four propellant formulation modification categories were investigated.

2-s2.0-85087439203,"A field-applicable colorimetric assay for fast detection of notorious explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) has been developed through the selective irreversible oxidation of 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine by hydrogen peroxide (HP) liberated during the acidic hydrolysis/degradation of TATP in the presence of MnO2 nanozymes. The generated HP was detected by probing the absorbance of the product (indamine polymer) of the 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) oxidation reaction at 460.0 nm. The UV-Vis measurements provided a linear range from 1.57 to 10.50 mg L−1 TATP with a detection limit of 0.34 mg L−1. The oxidation of DAB cannot proceed by molecular oxygen, thus it is selectively oxidized by H2O2; this prevents false-positive results from laundry detergents (containing O2-releasing substances). Moreover, a naked-eye field test was developed, and a fast spot test analyzing time of 5 s was achieved. The selectivity of the assay was checked by analyzing some synthetic samples prepared with a laundry detergent as camouflage.

2-s2.0-85089808119,"As we live under a constant threat of global terrorism, the effective detection of highly energetic materials is one of the critical procedures needed at a variety of locations, including airports, border checkpoints, and entrances to high-security buildings. In this work, the application of optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectromicroscopy for the detection of highly explosive materials within fingerprints is described. High-explosive (HE) materials (e.g., PETN, RDX, C-4, or TNT) were used to prepare contaminated fingerprints. These were subsequently deposited on various objects, including microscopic glass slides, a table, a mug, etc. Samples deposited on glass slides were directly sent for analyses; for other samples, adhesive tapes were used to lift off fingermarks. In cases of difficulty in locating fingerprints, additional powders were used to enhance their visibility. Experiments were performed with a mIRage IR microscope working in a noncontact, far-field reflection mode, offering submicron IR spectroscopy and imaging. Fast imaging (several characteristic absorbances were selected for every substance of interest) was used to locate """"suspicious""""particles among various residues present in fingerprints. Subsequently, spectra were collected for those particles. Reflection mode O-PTIR spectra taken from powdered and nonenhanced fingerprints were of comparable quality to transmission mode FTIR spectra collected for pure HEs. On the basis of the performed experiments, we consider O-PTIR spectromicroscopy to open a new avenue for the nondestructive, efficient, and reliable analysis of exogenous substances deposited within fingerprints. The real significance of O-PTIR is in its ability to deliver high-quality, spatially resolved FTIR transmission-like spectra below the diffraction limit of infrared wavelengths, doing so in an easy-to-use reflection (far-field) mode. Collected spectra are also searchable and interpretable in both commercial and institutional IR databases without mathematical modeling.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Banas A., Banas K., Lo M.K.F., Kansiz M., Kalaiselvi S.M.P., Lim S.K., Loke J., Breese M.B.H.",12793969300;57943270700;49661618600;6506446223;24767789900;35170114100;55307846600;7005563036;,Detection of High-Explosive Materials within Fingerprints by Means of Optical-Photothermal Infrared Spectromicroscopy,2020,Analytical Chemistry,92,14,,9649,9657,NA,28,10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00938,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089808119&doi=10.1021%2facs.analchem.0c00938&partnerID=40&md5=436f533f75721b9ecdce9117fdb9be62,"Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore, 5 Research Link, Singapore, 117603, Singapore; Photothermal Spectroscopy Corp., 325 Chapala Street, Santa Barbara, CA  93101, United States; Forensic Division, Criminal Investigation Department, Police Cantonment Complex 391, New Bridge Road 20-04, Singapore, 088762, Singapore; Physics Department, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore, 117542, Singapore","Banas, A., Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore, 5 Research Link, Singapore, 117603, Singapore; Banas, K., Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore, 5 Research Link, Singapore, 117603, Singapore; Lo, M.K.F., Photothermal Spectroscopy Corp., 325 Chapala Street, Santa Barbara, CA  93101, United States; Kansiz, M., Photothermal Spectroscopy Corp., 325 Chapala Street, Santa Barbara, CA  93101, United States; Kalaiselvi, S.M.P., Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore, 5 Research Link, Singapore, 117603, Singapore; Lim, S.K., Forensic Division, Criminal Investigation Department, Police Cantonment Complex 391, New Bridge Road 20-04, Singapore, 088762, Singapore; Loke, J., Forensic Division, Criminal Investigation Department, Police Cantonment Complex 391, New Bridge Road 20-04, Singapore, 088762, Singapore; Breese, M.B.H., Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore, 5 Research Link, Singapore, 117603, Singapore, Physics Department, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore, 117542, Singapore",,Adhesives; Airport security; Diffraction; Explosives; Explosives detection; Glass; Palmprint recognition; Transmissions; Diffraction limits; Explosive materials; Global terrorism; Infrared spectromicroscopy; Infrared wavelengths; Spatially resolved; Spectromicroscopy; Transmission mode; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"Banas, A.; Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, 5 Research Link, Singapore; email: slsba@nus.edu.sg",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85080972506,"Raman spectroscopy was evaluated as a sensor for detection of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, AN), fuel oil (FO), AN-water solutions, and AN- and FO-soil mixtures deposited on materials such as glass, synthetic fabric, cardboard and electrical tape to simulate field conditions of explosives detection. AN is an inorganic oxidizing salt that is commonly used in fertilizers and mining explosives, however, due to its widespread accessibility, AN-based explosives are also utilized for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IED). Pure AN crystals were ground to powder size and deposited on several substrates for Raman analysis, whereas FO was analysed in a quartz cuvette. To simulate field conditions samples of powdered AN, AN-water solutions (0.1% to 10.0% AN w/w), AN-soil (50% to 90% AN w/w) and FO-soil (50% to 75% FO w/w) were prepared and deposited on the clutter materials. Raman spectra were acquired at integration times between 0.1 and 30 s, and 3 replicate Raman measurements were carried out for each sample. The spectral window observed ranged from 300 to 3800 cm−1. Several characteristic Raman bands were found, namely, at 710 cm−1 (NO3 −) and 1040 cm−1 (NO3 −) for AN; 1440–1470 cm−1 (CH) and 2800–3000 cm−1 (CH) for FO; 3000–3500 cm−1 (OH) for water; and 615 cm−1 (CCl), 1254 cm−1 (CH), 1400 cm−1 (CH2) and 1600 cm−1 (aromatic ring) for polyvinyl chloride (PVC, electrical tape). The effect of the AN concentration and integration time on the total and net Raman intensities, relative standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratio and relative limit of detection was evaluated. The relative limit of detection of AN in water was 0.1% (1 mg/g), and absolute limit of detection was 1.0 μg.

EDSCB varied systematically on three automation reliability measures: accuracy, d', and positive predictive value (PPV). Results showed that when unaided performance was high, operator confidence was high, and automation provided only small benefits. When unaided performance was lower, operator confidence was lower, and automation with higher d' provided large benefits. Operator compliance depended on the PPV of automation: We found lower compliance for lower PPV. Automation with a high false alarm rate of 20% and a low PPV of .3 resulted in operators ignoring about one-half of the true automation alarms on difficult targets—a strong cry-wolf effect. Our results suggest that automation reliability described by d' and PPV is more valid than using accuracy alone.

2-s2.0-85076582436,"The study of multi-hazard coupling disasters involves various challenges. One of the toughest challenges is analyzing the interactions between incidents, known as “synergic effects.” As its research object, this paper takes multi-hazard coupling disasters involving fire, explosions, and toxicant leaks in hazardous chemicals scenarios. It aims to quantitatively analyze the synergic effects in such environments, taking into account the amplification of the severity of the incidents and the delay in the fire brigade intervention. A method based on Monte Carlo simulation and damage analysis was applied to assess the hazard of multi-hazard coupling disasters and demonstrate the impacts of synergic effects. The Monte Carlo simulations presented the cumulative distribution functions of the severities of incidents. To examine the effectiveness of the assessment method, a case study was conducted of the severe fire and explosion that occurred in a chemical plant in Yancheng, China, in 2019. The results show that the currently suggested safety distance from the chemical plant is insufficient due to the failure to take into account the synergic effects of multi-hazard coupling disasters. The influence radius of incidents involving hazardous chemicals may be further than 1500 m, instead of the 500 m safety distance required by the current regulations.

2-s2.0-85079901335,"The deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in hot, thermally damaged HMX (δ-phase) and HMX-based polymer-bonded explosives (PBX 9501, LX-14, LX-10 and PBX 9012) differs in some respects from what has been observed in similar tests (DDT tube experiments) with room temperature granular explosives. We provide streak images with other observations and demonstrate the behavior can be binned according to the degree of porosity evolved from physical and chemical damage to the compositions. In each bin, the DDT behavior eventually organizes to resemble Type I DDT, but differs in the early-stage burn phenomena and how a propulsive thermal explosion event arises. We argue that the hot explosive properties, such as permeability and compressibility, and the morphological characteristics of the thermal damage, control the physical mechanism for establishment of the thermal explosion. In some cases, these observations may need to be carefully implemented in numerical models to increase predictive value for these materials at elevated temperature. With high-porosity (ϕ ≈ 20–50%), the PBXs behaved like granular beds. At intermediate levels of porosity (ϕ ≈ 4–20%), the transition occurred over longer distances and the process is characterized by a weak, slow convective burn precursor that sets up thermal runaway to explosion behind the flame infiltration front. In the low-porosity bin (ϕ ≈ 0–4%), where run lengths were short, the thermal explosion is the result of compressive, and possibly also, deconsolidative burning. It is clear that the high-temperature conditions imposed in these experiments caused sensitization towards DDT and this effect was most apparent in tests where the explosive was heated until runaway and auto-ignition where transition distances were among the shortest measured. Practical findings include there being some safety benefit for having binders in HMX formulations, especially when the binder is thermally stable. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Parker G.R., Heatwole E.M., Holmes M.D., Asay B.W., Dickson P.M., McAfee J.M.",8617962900;35582965300;56415783100;6701746678;7005285200;7007018149;,Deflagration-to-detonation transition in hot HMX and HMX-based polymer-bonded explosives,2020,Combustion and Flame,215,,,295,308,NA,22,10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.01.040,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079901335&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2020.01.040&partnerID=40&md5=e9763919db030108e398a51a9cc40e27,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Spring Hill Energetics, LLC, 410 Sheridan Road, Atchison, KS  66002, United States","Parker, G.R., Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Heatwole, E.M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Holmes, M.D., Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Asay, B.W., Spring Hill Energetics, LLC, 410 Sheridan Road, Atchison, KS  66002, United States; Dickson, P.M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; McAfee, J.M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Cookoff; DDT; HMX; LX-14; PBX 9501; Thermal damage,Binders; Combustion; Explosions; Porosity; Cookoff; Deflagration to detonation transition; Degree of porosity; Granular explosive; LX-14; PBX 9501; Polymer bonded explosives; Thermal damage; Thermal explosion; Transition tubes; Detonation,"Parker, G.R.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS P917, United States; email: gparker@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85084663458,"Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-based instruments have historically been accurate to, at best, ±2% of the reduced ion mobility (K0) value of the chemical of interest. Fielded IMS-based detectors that are in use for hazardous and illicit substance detection are subject to false-positive alarms because of this inaccuracy and the resulting wide alarm windows, which are required to maintain a high rate of true-positive alarms. To reduce false-positive alarm rates and improve the accuracy of any IMS-based instrument, accurate K0 values of an ion mobility reference standard need to be used for ion mobility scale calibration. However, a suitable calibrant has yet to be accurately analyzed and agreed upon by the IMS community. In this study, we have chosen five potential IMS calibrants on the basis of their rating against seven criteria for suitable standards and analyzed them as a function of drift gas temperature and humidity using an accurate ion mobility instrument. Recommendations are made herein for each potential calibrant's suitability as a standard for the wider IMS community. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Hauck B.C., Harden C.S., McHugh V.M.",55255962000;7006761162;6508009408;,Accurate Evaluation of Potential Calibration Standards for Ion Mobility Spectrometry,2020,Analytical Chemistry,92,8,,6158,6165,NA,12,10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00859,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084663458&doi=10.1021%2facs.analchem.0c00859&partnerID=40&md5=8c1d364764725256fc107c57de921b77,"Science and Technology Corporation (STC), Support to CCDC CBC, 111 C Bata Blvd., Belcamp, MD  21017, United States; U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center (CCDC CBC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD  21010, United States","Hauck, B.C., Science and Technology Corporation (STC), Support to CCDC CBC, 111 C Bata Blvd., Belcamp, MD  21017, United States; Harden, C.S., Science and Technology Corporation (STC), Support to CCDC CBC, 111 C Bata Blvd., Belcamp, MD  21017, United States; McHugh, V.M., U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center (CCDC CBC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD  21010, United States",,Alarm systems; Calibration; Ions; Spectrometry; Calibrants; Calibration standard; False positive; Ion Mobility; Ion mobility spectrometry; Reference standard; Scale calibration; True positive; Ion mobility spectrometers,"Hauck, B.C.; Science and Technology Corporation (STC), 111 C Bata Blvd., United States; email: brian.c.hauck3.ctr@mail.mil",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85067660616,"Ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) are investigated as propellants for their thermal decomposition behaviors and burning characteristics. The performance effects of AP particle size, AP content in the oxidizer (ξ), and a catalytic amount of Fe2O3 on the propellants are evaluated. A dependency exists between the thermal decomposition behaviors of the propellants and both AP particle size and ξ. Addition of Fe2O3 further affected the thermal decomposition behaviors of the propellants; these behaviors are not dependent on the added amount. Furthermore, the burning characteristics are dependent on the AP size, ξ, and the amount of Fe2O3 added.

2-s2.0-85084425694,"The experimental analyses of ignition and burning responses of mild-impacted granular explosive, namely, cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), were performed based on an optimized drop-weight system equipped with a High-Speed Camera (HSC). It has been found that jetting phenomena observed by HSC is the result of the energy released by gaseous products, which push the pulverized or melted explosives to splash radially. Jetting is the only and the most obvious difference between reactive and inert particles prior to combustion so that it can be regarded as the sign of ignition more accurately than other ways. For RDX sample, the molten phase plays an important role in the hot-spots formation. After a piece of waxed paper is put on the glass anvil, the jetting of molten-phase RDX will be limited due to the high-roughness of waxed paper. Moreover, ignition growth to burning probability of RDX particles is increased compared with the non-waxed paper case. Radial deformation velocity, jetting velocity, and flame propagation velocity have been estimated via image processing, making it possible to quantify the violence of mechanical deformation and chemical reaction. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The obtained SmCrO3 perovskite oxide nanopowder exhibits strong fluorescence at near-UV and visible regions in polar solvents such as ethyl acetate (EtOAc), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethyl methyl ketone (EMK) that its fluorescence could be strongly quenched by nitro explosives such as TNP, TNT, HMX and RDX at room temperature. Thus, the prepared fluorescent nanopowder was used as chemosensor for selective detection of nitro explosives. The lowest detection limit (6.0 × 10−8 M) was observed for HMX and the highest detection limit (9.6 × 10−7 M) was obtained for TNP in THF solvent. The obtained results confirm that the quenching effect of the nitro explosives on the fluorescence signal of the SmCrO3 nanopowder can be take place fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. This rare earth orthochromite based perovskite will introduce a new group of inorganic compounds that potentially can be effective for rapid and sensitive sensing for trace value of the nitro explosives.

2-s2.0-85078728475,"The initiation of high explosives (HEs) under shock loading lacks a comprehensive understanding: particularly at the particle scale. One common explanation is the hot spot theory, which suggests that energy in the material resulting from the impact event is localized in a small area causing an increase in temperature that can lead to ignition. This study focuses on the response of HMX particles (a common HE) within a polymer matrix (Sylgard-184®), a simplified example of a polymer-bound explosive (PBX). These PBXs consist of multiple HMX particles in a single polymer-bound sample. A light gas gun was used to load the samples at impact velocities above 400 m/s. The impact events were visualized using X-ray phase-contrast imaging (PCI) allowing real-time observation of the impact event. The experiment used two different types of samples (multi-particle and two crystals) and found evidence of cracking and debonding in both sample types. In addition, it was found that the multiple particle samples showed similar evidence of damage at lower velocities than that of single particle samples. This is an expected result as the multiple particles add additional interfaces for stress concentration and frictional heating. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85084295391,"A sensitive electrochemical sensor was developed for the detection of nitro-explosives in aqueous solutions based on thin molecularly imprinted polydopamine films. Dopamine was identified in silico, based on DFT (density functional theory) calculations with the ωB97X-D/6-31G* basis set, as the best functional monomer and electropolymerized via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the presence of carboxylic acid-based structural analogues ('dummy' templates) for two model nitro-explosives: TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and RDX (Research Department eXplosive, 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine). This approach afforded a homogenous coverage of gold electrodes with imprinted films of tunable thickness. The electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polydopamine films allowed for a 105-fold sensitivity improvement over a bare gold electrode based on tracking the redox peaks of the targets by CV. This improved sensitivity is ascribed to the ability of the MIP to concentrate its target in proximity to the transduction element. The MIP films showed reproducible binding in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4), with a dynamic range from 0.1 nM to 10 nM for both TNT and RDX and an increased selectivity over closely related structural analogues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Leibl N., Duma L., Gonzato C., Haupt K.",57216692774;6602956749;12797503100;7006126347;,Polydopamine-based molecularly imprinted thin films for electro-chemical sensing of nitro-explosives in aqueous solutions,2020,Bioelectrochemistry,135,,107541,,,NA,42,10.1016/j.bioelechem.2020.107541,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084295391&doi=10.1016%2fj.bioelechem.2020.107541&partnerID=40&md5=c4deea5c995081da741d9e0c0a170612,"Sorbonne Université, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS Enzyme and Cell Engineering Laboratory, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne Cedex, 60203, France","Leibl, N., Sorbonne Université, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS Enzyme and Cell Engineering Laboratory, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne Cedex, 60203, France; Duma, L., Sorbonne Université, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS Enzyme and Cell Engineering Laboratory, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne Cedex, 60203, France; Gonzato, C., Sorbonne Université, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS Enzyme and Cell Engineering Laboratory, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne Cedex, 60203, France; Haupt, K., Sorbonne Université, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS Enzyme and Cell Engineering Laboratory, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne Cedex, 60203, France","2,4,6-trinitrotoluene; Chemosensor; Cyclic voltammetry; Electropolymerization; Molecularly imprinted polymers; Nitro-explosives; Polydopamine; RDX; Thin films","Amines; Chemical sensors; Cyclic voltammetry; Density functional theory; Electrochemical sensors; Electrodes; Explosives detection; Gold; Thin films; Chemical sensing; Functional monomer; Gold electrodes; Molecularly imprinted; Phosphate buffers; Sensitivity improvements; Structural analogue; TNT (2 ,4 ,6trinitrotoluene); Explosives; carboxylic acid; dopamine; explosive; glyceryl trinitrate; molecularly imprinted polymer; monomer; nitro derivative; phosphate; triazine derivative; trinitrotoluene; cyclonite; explosive; indole derivative; nitrogen derivative; polydopamine; polymer; triazine derivative; trinitrotoluene; water; aqueous solution; Article; cyclic voltammetry; density functional theory; electrochemistry; electrodeposition; polymerization; reaction analysis; thickness; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; electrochemical analysis; electrode; limit of detection; molecular imprinting; procedures; solution and solubility; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Explosive Agents; Indoles; Limit of Detection; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Molecular Imprinting; Nitrogen Compounds; Polymers; Solutions; Triazines; Trinitrotoluene; Water","Gonzato, C.; Sorbonne Université, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, France; email: carlo.gonzato@utc.fr",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85076782635,"Many years of research on more effective and safer explosives led to the development of emulsion explosives. They are the second most commonly used group of explosives in the world, primarily due to the fact that they are a good alternative to ANFO explosives or dynamites. Their key advantage in underground applications is the lower content of toxic fumes in the detonation products. Emulsions are also characterized by high detonation velocity, high water resistance, low value of critical diameter and mechanical loading capacity. Multiple factors related to the applied mining method influence the detonation parameters of emulsion explosives. One such parameter is the time between the loading of the explosive into the blast hole and firing, which in the case of underground copper mines in Poland can even last up to 48 hours. This becomes a particularly significant issue due to the increasing depth of mining in Polish copper mines and the high virgin temperature of rock mass at these depths. Experiences related to the use of explosives and their efficiency under such conditions confirm the intuitive thesis that high ambient temperature has a negative impact on the explosives’ effectiveness. In this regard, research concerning the influence of temperature on the detonation velocity of selected emulsion explosives was carried out, including bulk and packaged explosives. The tests were performed for different conditioning temperatures, which are all locally observed in Polish copper mines. The obtained results confirmed the significant influence of temperature on the velocity of detonation of the considered explosives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Mertuszka P., Fuławka K., Pytlik M., Szastok M.",36994755300;57200614507;57195060925;57212468148;,The influence of temperature on the detonation velocity of selected emulsion explosives,2020,Journal of Energetic Materials,38,3,,336,347,NA,9,10.1080/07370652.2019.1702739,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076782635&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1702739&partnerID=40&md5=1bda33490be97e7f7ffd8c1d7d6a9889,"Rock Engineering Department, KGHM CUPRUM Ltd.

IRMOF-3 particles are synthesized using zinc nitrate as a metal precursor and 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid as a linker. The nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) are synthesized from citric acid and ethylenediamine as carbon and nitrogen precursor, respectively. The NCQDs are conjugated with IRMOF-3 particles as IRMOF-3/NCQDs. The TEM micrograph revealed the average size of IRMOF-3 particles to be 363.66 nm. The photoluminescence emission intensity of IRMOF-3 particles at λem 430 nm is highly increased in the presence of NCQDs (λex 330 nm). Both the as-synthesized IRMOF-3 and IRMOF-3/NCQD particles are explored for TNT detection to compare the effect of NCQDs on the IRMOF-3 particle surface. Lower limit of detection (7.5 × 10−8 M) and higher Stern–Volmer constant (4.46 × 106 M−1) are achieved by IRMOF-3/NCQD particles. The association constant also increased from 5.3 × 104 to 2.78 × 106 M−1 after the conjugation of IRMOF-3 particles with NCQDs. Moreover, enhanced selectivity for TNT over trinitrophenol is achieved using the IRMOF-3/NCQD particles.

Especially, a set of nanowrinkles with 50−60 nm was found on the sidewall of nanocone after etching. By coating 30 nm gold film, this flexible SERS substrate provided uniform hot spots, which demonstrated high reproducibility and sensitivity. 4-ATP molecules based Meisenheimer complex, which is a well-known charge-transfer interaction between electron-poor TNT and electron-rich amino group, was taken to detect ultra-low concentration of TNT explosive. The Raman signal of TNT was significantly enhanced by charge-transfer, light trapping effect and coupled electromagnetic field. The detection sensitivity of TNT molecules was as low as 10−13mol/L, and show a good linear response in the range from 10−8 to 10−13mol/L. Consequently, by brushing this flexible SERS substrate onto a cloth bag, trace amount of TNT residues with concentration as low as 10-10mol/L can be easily analyzed.

2-s2.0-85086717269,"Energetic materials, including explosives, pyrotechnics, and propellants, are widely used in mining, demolition, automobile airbags, fireworks, ordnance, and space technology. Nanoenergetic materials (nEMs) have a high reaction rate and high energy density, which are both adjustable to a large extent. Structural control over nEMs to achieve improved performance and multifunctionality leads to a fascinating research area, namely, nanostructured energetic materials. Among them, core–shell structured nEMs have gained considerable attention due to their improved material properties and combined multiple functionalities. Various nEMs with core–shell structures have been developed through diverse synthesis routes, among which core–shell structured nEMs associated with explosives and metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are extensively studied due to their good tunability and wide applications, as well as excellent energetic (e.g., enhanced heat release and combustion) and/or mechanical properties. Herein, the preparation methods and fundamental properties of the abovementioned kinds of core–shell structured nEMs are summarized and the reasons behind the satisfactory performance clarified, based on which suggestions regarding possible future research directions are proposed. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85085772238,"Raman spectroscopy has long been considered a gold standard for optically based chemical identification, but has not been adopted in non-laboratory operational settings due to limited sensitivity and slow acquisition times. Ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectroscopy has the potential to address these challenges through the reduction of fluorescence from background materials and increased Raman scattering due to the shorter wavelength (relative to visible or near-infrared excitation) and resonant enhancement effects. However, the benefits of UV Raman must be evaluated against specific operational situations: the actual realized fluorescence reduction and Raman enhancement depend on the specific target materials, target morphology, and operational constraints. In this paper, the wavelength trade-space in UV Raman spectroscopy is evaluated for one specific application: checkpoint screening for trace explosive residues. The optimal UV wavelength is evaluated at 244, 266, and 355 nm for realistic trace explosive and explosive-related compound (ERC) residues on common checkpoint materials: we perform semi-empirical analysis that includes the UV penetration depth of common explosive and ERCs, realistic explosive and ERC residue particle sizes, and the fluorescence signal of common checkpoint materials. We find that while generally lower UV wavelength provides superior performance, the benefits may be significantly reduced depending on the specific explosive and substrate. Further, logistical requirements (size, weight, power, and cost) likely limit the adoption of optimal wavelengths.

2-s2.0-85092412918,"A trace chemical detector is described that combines external-cavity quantum cascade lasers and a mercury cadmium telluride camera to capture hyperspectral images of the diffuse reflectance from a target surface in the long-wave infrared. The system is able to generate individual hypercubes in <0.1 s. When raster scanning the laser beam over the target surface, areal coverage rates of >60 cm2 / s have been achieved. Results are presented for standoff distances ranging from 0.1 to 25 m. Hyperspectral images generated by the system are analyzed for spectral features that indicate the presence of trace surface contaminants. This approach has been found to be highly capable of detecting trace chemical residues on a wide variety of surfaces, and we present a collection of detection results to demonstrate the capabilities of this technology. Examples include the detection of 10 μg of saccharin powder on a wide range of substrates, 0.2 μg of an explosive residue on a computer keyboard, residual pharmaceuticals within a plastic baggie, and a contaminated fingerprint on cell phone case.  © The Authors.

2-s2.0-85081887622,"A series of shock initiation experiments on the explosive PBXC03 (87 % HMX, 7 % TATB, and 6 % Viton by weight) with different particle sizes and porosities under various shock loadings have been performed, and it is found that the particle size and the porosity of the explosives have much influence on the shock initiation characteristics. That is, the smaller the particle size, the more difficult the explosive to be ignited but the faster the detonation grows once the explosive is ignited. It is also found that the detonation grows the fastest in the explosive with moderate porosity. Moreover, a modified mesoscopic reaction rate model based on the experimental results and the pore collapse hot-spot ignition mechanism is developed, which allows for a separate reaction mechanism evaluation at different reaction stages for the shock initiation and detonation growth processes in the explosives. The calculated pressure-time histories and Pop-Plots for PBXC03 are founded to be all in good agreement with the experimental data. The modified mesoscopic reaction rate model shows its potentiality for quantitatively predicting the effects of the mesostructure of PBXs on the shock initiation and detonation growth processes with a high degree of confidence. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85086701800,"In this follow-up study the collaboration between two research groups from the USA and the Netherlands was continued to expand the framework of chemical attribution for the homemade explosive erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis was performed to predict possible links between ETN samples and its precursors. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were determined for a wide variety of precursor sources and for ETN samples that were prepared with selected precursors. The stability of isotope ratios of ETN has been demonstrated for melt-cast samples and two-year old samples, which enables sample comparison of ETN in forensic casework independent of age and appearance. Erythritol and nitric acid (or nitrate salt) are the exclusive donor of carbon and nitrogen atoms in ETN, respectively, and robust linear relationships between precursor and the end-product were observed for these isotopes. This allowed for defining isotopic enrichment ranges for carbon and nitrogen that support the hypothesis that a given erythritol or nitrate precursor was used to synthesize a specific ETN batch. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms in ETN do not originate from one exclusive donor material, making linkage prediction more difficult. However, the large negative enrichments observed for both isotopes do provide powerful information to exclude suspected precursor materials as donor of ETN. Additionally, combing the isotopic data of all elements results in a higher discrimination power for ETN samples and its precursor materials. Combining the findings of our previously reported LC–MS analysis of ETN with this IRMS study is expected to increase the robustness of the forensic comparison even further. The partially nitrated impurities can provide insight on the synthesis conditions while the isotope data contain information on the raw materials used for the production of ETN. © 2020 The Authors","Bezemer K., McLennan L., Hessels R., Schoorl J., van den Elshout J., van der Heijden A., Hulsbergen A., Koeberg M., Busby T., Yevdokimov A., de Rijke E., Schoenmakers P., Smith J., Oxley J., van Asten A.",56226487300;57188933115;57217194230;57132619100;6506231904;7004857398;57214448515;6602853554;57212537510;56705308900;7801395070;35510357700;7410170253;7004427947;56099430100;,Chemical attribution of the homemade explosive ETN - Part II: Isotope ratio mass spectrometry analysis of ETN and its precursors,2020,Forensic Science International,313,,110344,,,NA,10,10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110344,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086701800&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2020.110344&partnerID=40&md5=d4d095de02aac4f98d3adde10d2dd117,"Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands; Netherlands Forensic Institute, The Hague, Netherlands; University of Rhode Island, Department of Chemistry, Kingston, RI, United States; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands; Dept.

2-s2.0-85092570641,"In search of a rapid, low-cost, and solution-phase detection technique for explosives, the (spectro-)electrochemistry of compounds from two major nonaromatic classes, namely nitramines (RDX and HMX) and nitrate esters (pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and the plastic explosive composite Semtex 1A) in acetonitrile (AN) is reported. In electrochemical screening, 5 μg of explosive material was detectable in 10 s by multicomponent cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis on unmodified glassy carbon under ubiquitous environmental influences (i.e., trace water and dissolved oxygen). The explosives were identified with high recoveries under a battery of proof-of-concept testing scenarios in various matrices. In AN containing naturally dissolved oxygen (approx. 2 mM), the superoxide radical is co-electrogenerated during analyte reduction. Free superoxide yields prominent signals that the explosives attenuate quantitatively. To gain further insight into the electrochemical transformation mechanism, spectroelectrochemistry was employed to monitor changes in ultraviolet (UV) absorbance during CV and identify transient intermediates and product species, which could be targeted by future chemical sensors. Overlapping UV spectra of multiple species are deconvoluted using a new strategy, spectral regional baselining, for time- and potential-resolved spectroelectrochemical (SEC) analysis. This study shows that dissolved oxygen, hitherto an interferent purposefully removed from the solution, can be exploited advantageously in electrochemical sensing. The work expands our understanding of high-explosive solution-phase chemistry and offers a novel route to signal transduction for the sensing of energetic materials.

2-s2.0-85088923262,"The objective of this work was to measure infrared spectra of high explosive materials (HE) in wide spectral range in order to acquire information for their complete characterization and find out the regions that are the most discriminatory for each material. Four HEs were measured by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in a very broad range (from near- via mid- to far-IR). Obtained spectra were subsequently evaluated using multivariate statistical methods for dimension reduction and results grouping. Clustering was assessed in terms of compactness and stability in order to distinguish which region or regions are most suitable for the identification based on spectral signature. Based on outcomes of visualization method (silhouette plot) used to compare results of implemented chemometric methods (HCA, PAM, and PCA) done on FTIR spectra collected for four high explosive materials (PETN, C-4, RDX, and TNT) within all regions, it seems that the mid-IR region is the most informative for the distinction among analyzed HE materials based on substance spectral signatures.

2-s2.0-85082123887,"Radiation based techniques such as PGNAA provided a good alternative to conventional explosives detection methods due to the simplicity and efficiency of the quantitative isotopic technique. This paper introduces a framework that identifies explosive materials using H, C, and O isotopic prints. The first step is to regress the weight fractions of H, C and O isotopes in the sample separately using the gamma peaks as input. The regressed percentages will be used as input to the classifier to identify if this sample is explosive or not. The data used for training the model are generated using MCNP5 and validated on the 2017 ROMASHA experimental setup in Frank Laboratory in JINR, Russia. Our data set consisted of 316 gamma peak observations, which are split into 85% for training and 15% for testing. Experiments showed that KNN-regressor achieved best results to predict the H, C and O weight fractions with average MSE of 0.005 and R2 of 0.95. Also, the decision-tree-classifier achieved best results to identify whether the sample is explosive or not with the accuracy of 0.98. And, the assembled pipeline achieved total accuracy of 0.92 after error propagation through the two models.

X-ray diffraction analysis was performed, and the single-crystal structures of compounds 3, 4, 6, and 7 were obtained. For these newly prepared energetic materials, the thermal stability was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while the sensitivities were evaluated using BAM drop hammer and friction test. The calculated heat of formation values and the measured densities were used to determine the detonation parameters, including detonation velocity and pressure, using the EXPLO5 program. Of all the prepared compounds, dipotassium 1,4-bis(dinitromethyl)-3,6-dinitro-1,4-dihydropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole (3) was crystallized as a three-dimensional energetic metal-organic framework (MOF) and showed outstanding detonation performances, which even outperformed the traditional primary explosive lead azide. Compound 7 exhibited a high crystal density of 1.939 g cm−3, the high decomposition temperature of 213 °C and desirable impact and friction sensitivities (IS: 12 J; FS: 240 N).

2-s2.0-85081987635,"Surface defects of explosive cartridge in the automatic sorting process are of a small area, irregular shape, and random distribution, and all problematic characteristics that hinder surface defect detection. To address these issues, a new multidefect detection method has been proposed in this paper based on a combination of an improved visual attention model and image partitioning-weighted eigenvalue (IP-WEV). First, image preprocessing is carried out by a background estimation algorithm. Then, a new fusion operator based on defects discrimination is implemented in a visual attention model to integrate intensity, orientation, and edge conspicuity into a saliency graph, in which a saliency effect of defects is considered during the fusion process. Third, a saliency map is divided into image blocks based on the image variance. This allows for the extraction of image blocks including defects, the calculation of the weighted eigenvalue, and the determination of regions containing multidefect. The IP-WEV is used to make a decision for multidefect. The experimental results show this method's detection accuracy as 98.2%, with a less computation time and quickly detection speed.

The research on the interaction mechanism between TKX-50 and AP is very important for designing TKX-50-AP compounds and judging the formation feasibility of composite particles, which can lay a theoretical foundation for the preparation of TKX-50-AP mixed crystals and the application of TKX-50 in propellant, propellant and explosive. Herein, in order to research the interaction mechanism between TKX-50 and AP, density-functional theory calculation was applied to optimize three configurations of TKX-50-AP compounds. The geometry structure, electrostatic potential and binding energy of the compounds were predicted, and the electronic density topological analysis was also carried out. Then TKX-50-AP mixed crystals structures were constructed, and the radial distribution function of H–O and H–N in mixed crystals was calculated. Finally, solvent/non-solvent method was applied to prepare TKX-50-AP composites, and the infrared spectroscopy and the non-isothermal decomposition performance of the composites were characterized. Results show that the superposition of positive charges in TKX-50 molecule and negative charges in AP makes the electrostatic potential distributions of TKX-50-AP compounds different from that of TKX-50 and AP. The interaction energies of TKX-50-AP 1, TKX-50-AP 2 and TKX-50-AP 3 are 39.743 kJ/mol, 61.206 kJ/mol and 27.702 kJ/mol, respectively. The interaction between TKX-50 molecules and AP molecules in TKX-50-AP mixed crystals both depends on hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force, and the number and strength of hydrogen bonds are significantly greater than that of van der Waals force. The composition of AP and TKX-50 makes the absorption peak of the five-membered rings and NH3OH+ of TKX-50 shift to low wavenumber in the infrared spectroscopy. In general, TKX-50 interacts with AP via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The composition of TKX-50 and AP can also prolong the decomposition process. © 2019","Tao J., Wang X.-F., Zhang K., Feng X.-S.",56479847800;56005702500;58596092000;35768981700;,Theoretical calculation and experimental study on the interaction mechanism between TKX-50 and AP,2020,Defence Technology,16,4,,825,833,NA,24,10.1016/j.dt.2019.10.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075854990&doi=10.1016%2fj.dt.2019.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=a5cc54856b0bb9b1cf63f5cc3840f02e,"The Second Department, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China","Tao, J., The Second Department, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Wang, X.-F., The Second Department, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Zhang, K., The Second Department, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Feng, X.-S., The Second Department, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China","5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate; Ammonium perchlorate; Density-functional theory; Hydrogen bond; Molecular dynamics",Binding energy; Complexation; Composite propellants; Distribution functions; Electrostatics; Hydrogen bonds; Infrared spectroscopy; Inorganic compounds; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Propellants; Topology; Van der Waals forces; Ammonium perchlorates; Electrostatic potential distribution; Electrostatic potentials; Interaction mechanisms; Non-isothermal decomposition; Radial distribution functions; Theoretical calculations; Theoretical foundations; Density functional theory,"Tao, J.; The Second Department, China; email: taojun4712230@126.com

2-s2.0-85082166649,"Two new structural motifs based on oxacalix[4]arene appended N-(3-bromopropyl) phthalimide moieties, FON3PPh and PON3PPh was prepared, and its fluorogenic behaviors towards nitroaromatic explosives were investigated. The sensors exhibit preferential binding towards 4-nitro toluene (4-NT) and 2,6-dinitro toluene (2,6-DNT) based on the conformational orientation of the oxacalix[4]arene-host cavity. Spectrofluorimetric and 1H NMR titration studies support drastic changes inferred due to the complexation of the nitroaromatic explosives with FON3PPh and PON3PPh. The linear concentration range of FON3PPh for 4-NT is 5 μM to 4.5 mM with the detection limit of 2.4 μM and for PON3PPh, the linear concentration range 2,6-DNT is 0.5 μM to 5 mM with the detection limit of 0.1 μM. The binding ability of FON3PPh and PON3PPh for 4-NT and 2,6-DNT was determined as 1.15 × 104 M−1 and 3.02 × 104 M−1, respectively. Further, Density Functional Theory (DFT) based conformational modeling suggested that the spatial orientation of the guests in conformationally different hosts (PON3PPh and FON3PPh) lead to a varied selectivity pattern. The calculations also reveal that the complexation is thermodynamically favorable and selective. This work provides methodology to understand selective recognition of explosives based on structurally altered motifs of supramolecular architectures. The cytotoxic activity of FON3PPh and PON3PPh was also evaluated against human cancer cell lines in vitro. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Panchal M., Kongor A., Athar M., Modi K., Patel C., Dey S., Vora M., Bhadresha K., Rawal R., Jha P.C., Jain V.K.",56709438600;56709598400;57756289300;56417408500;57194417341;57189901272;57193468373;57212173822;7004237030;56363650800;57418790600;,Structural motifs of oxacalix[4]arene for molecular recognition of nitroaromatic explosives: Experimental and computational investigations of host-guest complexes,2020,Journal of Molecular Liquids,306,,112809,,,NA,15,10.1016/j.molliq.2020.112809,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082166649&doi=10.1016%2fj.molliq.2020.112809&partnerID=40&md5=fadc836cb81a4977aa14217da3022988,"Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; School of Chemical Sciences, Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, Gujarat  382030, India; Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry, Ganpat University, Kherva, Mehsana, Gujarat, India; Department of Botany, Bioinformatics and Climate Change Impacts Management, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Department of LifeScience, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Centre for Applied Chemistry, Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, Gujarat  382030, India","Panchal, M., Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Kongor, A., Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Athar, M., School of Chemical Sciences, Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, Gujarat  382030, India; Modi, K., Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry, Ganpat University, Kherva, Mehsana, Gujarat, India; Patel, C., Department of Botany, Bioinformatics and Climate Change Impacts Management, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Dey, S., Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Vora, M., Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Bhadresha, K., Department of LifeScience, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Rawal, R., Department of LifeScience, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India; Jha, P.C., Centre for Applied Chemistry, Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, Gujarat  382030, India; Jain, V.K., Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, 380009, India",Chemosensors; Density functional theory; Host-guest complexes; Oxacalix [4]arene,Cell culture; Computation theory; Explosives; Toluene; Chemo-sensors; Computational investigation; Host guest complexes; Nitroaromatic explosives; Oxacalix [4]arene; Phthalimide moieties; Selective recognition; Supramolecular architectures; Density functional theory,"Jain, V.K.; Department of Chemistry, Navrangpura, India; email: drvkjain@hotmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85088209588,"Replacing existing inert binders with energetic ones in composite explosives is a novel way to improve the explosive performance, on the proviso that energetic binders are capable of releasing chemical energy rapidly in the detonation environment. Known to be a promising candidate, the reaction mechanism of glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) at typical detonation temperatures higher than 3000 K has been theoretically studied in this work at the atomistic level. By analyzing and tracking the cleavage of characteristic chemical bonds, it was found that at the detonation temperature, GAP was able to release a large amount of energy and small molecule products at a speed comparable to commonly used explosives in the early reaction stage, which was mainly attributed to the decomposition of azide groups into N2 and the main chain breakage into small fragments. Moreover, N2 generation was found to be accelerated by H atom transfer at an earlier reaction step. The dissociation energy of the main chain was lowered with structure deformation so as to facilitate the fragmentation of the GAP chain. Based on this analytical study of reaction kinetics, GAP was found to have higher reactivity at the detonation temperature than at lower temperatures. The small molecules' yield rate is of the same order of magnitude as an explosive detonation reaction, indicating that GAP has the potential to improve the performance of composite explosives. Our study reveals the chemical decomposition mechanism of a typical energetic binder, which would aid in the future design and synthesis of energetic binders so as to achieve both sensitivity-reducing and energy-enhancing performance goals simultaneously. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Liu D., Geng D., Yang K., Lu J., Chan S.H.Y., Chen C., Hng H.H., Chen L.",57190759110;57201743091;57213425416;55711006400;57218189042;57192205294;35562652700;35995373600;,Decomposition and Energy-Enhancement Mechanism of the Energetic Binder Glycidyl Azide Polymer at Explosive Detonation Temperatures,2020,Journal of Physical Chemistry A,124,27,,5542,5554,NA,14,10.1021/acs.jpca.0c02950,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088209588&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpca.0c02950&partnerID=40&md5=f179137c717e3d535e57ff9d5ac90c5c,"School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China","Liu, D., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; Geng, D., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Yang, K., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Lu, J., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Chan, S.H.Y., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; Chen, C., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; Hng, H.H., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; Chen, L., State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China",,Binders; Bond strength (chemical); Chemical analysis; Decomposition; Molecules; Reaction kinetics; Analytical studies; Chemical decomposition; Composite explosive; Dissociation energies; Explosive performance; Glycidyl azide polymer; Reaction mechanism; Structure deformation; Detonation,"Hng, H.H.; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Singapore; email: ashhhng@ntu.edu.sg

2-s2.0-85087529144,"Nitroaromatic explosives, such as 2-4-6 trinitrotoluene (TNT) are dangerous materials that pose safety and environmental risks. Even though many sensors have been reported for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives, a facile, rapid, cost-effective sensor is still sought-after in the field. Here we demonstrate a facile and rapid method to synthesize a fluorescent metal-organic framework for the highly selective and sensitive detection of nitroaromatic explosives. Zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) is synthesized and enhanced with fluorescent 8-hydroxyquinoline zinc (ZnQ). The synthesized material shows visible colour changes upon exposure to TNT from ivory to light red. In addition, fluorescence quenching is noted under UV illumination when the ZnQ@ZIF-8 is exposed to TNT. The ZnQ@ZIF-8-coated paper sensors show the highest fluorescence quenching at an emission wavelength of 455 nm with TNT concentration as low as 1 ppm. Therefore, the proposed strategy not only offers a fast and convenient protocol for selective detection of TNT but also offers great potential in practical applications, especially for airport/railway security inspection and prevention of terrorist attacks. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Abuzalat O., Wong D., Park S.S., Kim S.",57201374652;57194853486;7501833349;55718948100;,Highly selective and sensitive fluorescent zeolitic imidazole frameworks sensor for nitroaromatic explosive detection,2020,Nanoscale,12,25,,13523,13530,NA,56,10.1039/d0nr01653e,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087529144&doi=10.1039%2fd0nr01653e&partnerID=40&md5=ad8537207f9642f5e6aace508b0e9bc8,"Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB  T2N 1N4, Canada; Department of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt","Abuzalat, O., Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB  T2N 1N4, Canada, Department of Chemical Engineering, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Wong, D., Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB  T2N 1N4, Canada; Park, S.S., Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB  T2N 1N4, Canada; Kim, S., Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB  T2N 1N4, Canada",,Airport security; Aromatic compounds; Cost effectiveness; Explosives; Fluorescence; Fluorescence quenching; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Quenching; Zinc alloys; 8-Hydroxyquinoline; Cost-effective sensors; Emission wavelength; Environmental risks; Nitroaromatic explosives; Selective detection; Sensitive detection; Synthesized materials; Explosives detection; Aromatic Compounds; Cost Effectiveness; Detection; Explosives; Exposure; Fluorescence; Quenching; Sensors,"Abuzalat, O.; Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Canada; email: osama.abuzalat@mtc.edu.eg

The shape of the free-field shock wave, ground reflection shock wave, and Mach wave and explosion flame were captured by high-speed camera. The experimental results show that, at the same horizontal distance from the initiation point, the peak overpressure of explosive shock wave of composition B explosive, both in the air and on the ground, is less than that of RDX and aluminized explosives. At a distance of 3.0 m from the initiation point, the peak overpressure of aluminized explosives is slightly less than that of RDX explosives. Owing to the exothermic effect of aluminum powder, the pressure drop of aluminized explosives is slower than that of RDX explosives. At 5.0 m from the initiation point, the peak overpressure of aluminized explosives is larger than that of RDX explosives. At the same position from the initiation point, among the three kinds of explosives, the impulse of aluminized explosives is the maximum and the impulse of composition B explosives is the minimum.

The results of X-ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed that the two polymers are isostructural with the major intermolecular CH⋯π and π⋯π interactions. Microstructures of these polymers were also synthesized using a sonochemical method in different concentrations and reaction times. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and IR spectroscopy were applied to fully characterize these compounds. The photoluminescent properties of microrod MOPs were also evaluated to add to our understanding of their potential ability for nitro compound sensing. These experiments showed that MOPs I and II are good luminescence sensors for detection of nitro explosives in aqueous media. The probes maintained their high sensitivity and selectivity for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The energy transfer process accompanied by electrostatic interactions of 4-NP with these MOPs can be considered as an influential reason for the selectivity of 4-NP. The competitive study of the quenching process has a6lso shown superior operation with microparticles compared with bulky polymers. These results indicate that this method may be useful to synthesize luminescent materials possessing good sensing properties. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Gholivand K., K.

Structure and morphological characterization of the different nanoparticles have been investigated in detail by using a series of analytical methods including FTIR, Raman, XRD and SEM. The synthesized nanoparticles, predominately spherical in shape, have similar chemical structure, whatever the precursor employed. A higher crystallinity has been obtained for nanoparticles derived from iron chloride precursor, which present less agglomeration. The catalytic activity of as-prepared nanoparticles on the thermal decomposition of nitrocellulose (NC) was studied via differential scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Four isoconversional methods have been used to determine the kinetics triplets using the DSC data at different heating rates. It is revealed that the different nanocatalysts have a slight effect on the peak decomposition temperature of NC, whereas a notable decrease of the activation energy is obtained, especially for nanoparticles derived from iron chloride precursor. Finally, we can deduce that Fe2O3 prepared using iron chloride as a precursor may be safely used as an efficient catalyst for NC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Benhammada A., Trache D., Kesraoui M., Tarchoun A.F., Chelouche S., Mezroua A.",57212347121;55008987800;57215999831;57195423540;57202815717;8098920900;,Synthesis and characterization of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles from different precursors and their catalytic effect on the thermal decomposition of nitrocellulose,2020,Thermochimica Acta,686,,178570,,,NA,63,10.1016/j.tca.2020.178570,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080070716&doi=10.1016%2fj.tca.2020.178570&partnerID=40&md5=5c561e770cdae76045a23589ee141c99,"UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Ecole Nationale Préparatoire Aux Etudes d'Ingénieur Badji Mokhtar, ENPEI, BP 5, Rouiba, Algiers, 16013, Algeria","Benhammada, A., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria, Ecole Nationale Préparatoire Aux Etudes d'Ingénieur Badji Mokhtar, ENPEI, BP 5, Rouiba, Algiers, 16013, Algeria; Trache, D., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Kesraoui, M., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Tarchoun, A.F., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Chelouche, S., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria; Mezroua, A., UER Procédés Energétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers, 16046, Algeria",Catalyst; DSC; Fe2O3; Kinetics; Nitrocellulose; Thermal decomposition,Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Chlorine compounds; Crystallinity; Decomposition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enzyme kinetics; Hematite; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Nitrocellulose; Pyrolysis; Sulfur compounds; Thermolysis; Decomposition temperature; Different precursors; Direct hydrothermal methods; Efficient catalysts; Fe2O3; Iso-conversional method; Morphological characterization; Synthesis and characterizations; Synthesis (chemical),"Trache, D.; UER Procédés Energétiques, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algeria; email: djalaltrache@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Elemental mapping using SEM demonstrated uniform dispersion of MIC particles into HMX. HMX nanocomposite demonstrated an increase in total heat release by 53% using DSC. Additionally MIC particles offered an increase in HMX destructive effect by 17% using Kast test.

2-s2.0-85107389109,"The analysis of complex blast scenarios typically requires advanced computational methods such as multi-material Eulerian and coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) analysis where Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equation of state is used to model the explosive material. While multiple sets of empirical JWL parameters for trinitrotoluene (TNT) explosives have been published over the past few decades, there is also a lack of guidelines and comparative studies on their applications for the blast analysis. A standardized description of the explosive material behavior allows for a better interpretation of results from research studies involving different blast scenarios and JWL parameters. In this paper, the authors utilize numerical finite element (FE) simulations to investigate the influence of different TNT JWL parameter sets on the blast wave characteristics of a free-air blast across different scaled distances. Utilizing multi-material Eulerian analysis, a series of spherical free-air blasts involving a 100-kg TNT charge modeled with different TNT JWL parameters are conducted. The blast wave characteristics including the incident overpressure, impulse, and time of arrival (TOA) are benchmarked against the empirical-based Kingery-Bulmash air blast formulations through the conventional weapon effect calculator CONWEP. It was found that the incident overpressure and impulse are highly sensitive to the JWL parameters, with differences as high as 40% at smaller scaled distances, while the influence on TOA is much less significant. This paper hopes to provide a guide for future users on the appropriate JWL parameter sets to model the air blast events involving TNT explosives.  © 2020 by ASME.","Giam A., Toh W., Tan V.B.C.",57203679262;55578139400;7004891117;,Numerical review of Jones-Wilkins-Lee parameters for trinitrotoluene explosive in free-air blast,2020,"Journal of Applied Mechanics, Transactions ASME",87,5,51008,,,NA,10,10.1115/1.4046243,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107389109&doi=10.1115%2f1.4046243&partnerID=40&md5=19dac4f933bd71c79dab5ac1209d11ef,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, 9 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117575, Singapore; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore, 639798, Singapore","Giam, A., Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, 9 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117575, Singapore; Toh, W., School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; Tan, V.B.C., Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, 9 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117575, Singapore",Computational mechanics; Dynamics; Stress analysis; Wave propagation,Aromatic compounds; Equations of state; Comparative studies; Conventional weapons; Equation of state; Eulerian analysis; Eulerian-lagrangian; Explosive materials; Finite element simulations; Time of arrival (TOA); Explosives,"Tan, V.B.C.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, 9 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore; email: mpetanbc@nus.edu.sg",Review,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Various commercially available pencil leads of different degrees of hardness were examined. Sparked GNM − SPEs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, SEM, CV, and EIS. Taking as criterion the highest response to the electro-reduction of nitro group of 2,4,6−trinitrotoluene (TNT) at −0.3 V at deoxygenated solutions, Castell 9000 (2B) pencil was selected as optimum. GNM − SPEs exhibited a linear response over the concentration range 1 − 100 ppb TNT, while the limit of detection (LOD) based on the 3σ/m criterion was calculated 0.44 ppb. The interference effect of other nitro − aromatic explosives and masking compounds, which are used to hinder the detection of TNT, was extensively investigated. The determination of TNT was also achieved by measuring the oxidation of the electrochemically generated hydroxylamine groups. In this format, each measurement was conducted with a new electrode polarized at −0.275 V for 2 min. At the cost of a slightly increased time of analysis, the anodic determination of TNT offered increased selectivity, applicability in non − deoxygenated solutions, linear response over the concentration range 1 − 50 ppb TNT and an LOD of 0.25 ppb.

2-s2.0-85085496008,"Operationally-deployed canine detectors are often trained on one or a limited number of materials representing a single target odor, and training frequently occurs using materials of a high purity grade in controlled scenarios with minimal other background odors. Conversely, in the field, canine detectors are expected to generalize and identify variations of the target odor, while discriminating from similar extraneous or background odors. This exemplifies the balance between generalization and discrimination required for effective canine detectors. This research explored the tendency for detection canines to generalize or discriminate between similar odorants. Two groups of related odorants were used in two separate studies; (1) odorants of similar functional groups with differing carbon chains, and (2) odorants of similar carbon chain length but differing functional groups. Within each odorant set, the effect of training was addressed by incrementally increasing the number of odorants each canine was trained to detect. Initially, discrimination increased with increasing molecular dissimilarity in both odorant groups. After further training on additional related odorants, generalization increased across the set of odorants of the same carbon chain length, but there were no significant changes in either generalization or discrimination across the set of odorants of the same functional group. The results suggest that the canines in this study were more likely to generalize across compounds of the same chain length with differing functional group than across compounds of the same functional group, but differing chain lengths. Furthermore, some variation in performance between individual canines indicated that the tendency to generalize differed with experience, breed, and other factors affecting olfaction. © 2020","DeGreeff L.E., Simon A.G., Peranich K., Holness H.K., Frank K., Furton K.G.",36992911500;57193125827;57193528459;55347017000;57210238002;7004543580;,Generalization and Discrimination of Molecularly Similar Odorants in Detection Canines and the Influence of Training,2020,Behavioural Processes,177,,104148,,,NA,16,10.1016/j.beproc.2020.104148,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085496008&doi=10.1016%2fj.beproc.2020.104148&partnerID=40&md5=e0db219e2d7d3f50351bcc0a4ea7386d,"U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6181, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington DC, 20375, United States; Florida International University, International Forensic Research Institute, Chemistry Department, 11200 SW 8thSt., Miami, FL  33199, United States; former National Research Council post-doctoral fellow at U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington DC, 20375, United States; Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head EOD Technology Division, 3767 Strauss Ave, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States","DeGreeff, L.E., U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6181, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington DC, 20375, United States, Florida International University, International Forensic Research Institute, Chemistry Department, 11200 SW 8thSt., Miami, FL  33199, United States; Simon, A.G., former National Research Council post-doctoral fellow at U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington DC, 20375, United States; Peranich, K., Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head EOD Technology Division, 3767 Strauss Ave, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States; Holness, H.K., Florida International University, International Forensic Research Institute, Chemistry Department, 11200 SW 8thSt., Miami, FL  33199, United States; Frank, K., Florida International University, International Forensic Research Institute, Chemistry Department, 11200 SW 8thSt., Miami, FL  33199, United States; Furton, K.G., Florida International University, International Forensic Research Institute, Chemistry Department, 11200 SW 8thSt., Miami, FL  33199, United States",Detection canine; generalization-discrimination balance; olfaction; olfactory discrimination; olfactory generalization; selectivity,"aliphatic carboxylic acid; butyric acid; carbon; fragrance; functional group; heptanoic acid derivative; hexanoic acid; isobutyric acid; isovaleric acid; valeric acid; fragrance; biochemical composition; canid; detection method; identification method; molecular analysis; odor; olfaction; operations technology; animal experiment; Article; beagle; Cavalier King Charles spaniel; Doberman pinscher; female; German shepherd; golden retriever; Labrador retriever; male; nonhuman; odor; olfactory discrimination; response generalization; Shetland sheepdog; smelling; spaniel; springer spaniel; task performance; terrier; training; animal; dog; odor; Animals; Dogs; Generalization, Psychological; Odorants; Smell","DeGreeff, L.E.; U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6181, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, United States; email: lauryn.degreeff@nrl.navy.mil",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85084860029,"Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a primary component in chemical explosives, making them a common focus in public safety detection. However, it is very difficult to achieve selective and sensitive detection of the TNT molecule in practical application. In the present study, a simple surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing based on monoethanolamine (MEA) - modified gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was expanded for high selectivity and sensitive detecting of TNT in an envelope, luggage, lake water, and clothing through a quickly sampling and detection process. The monoethanolamine molecule based on Meisenheimer complex lights up ultra-high Raman scattering of a nonresonant molecule on the superficial coat of gold nanoparticles. Using this detection sensor, a molecular bridge can be established to selectively detect trinitrotoluene with a detection limit of 21.47 pM.

In this work, BCHMX was used to replace PETN in Semtex 1H to form Sem-BC+RDX. In addition, another mixture based on BCHMX and HMX as energetic fillers bonded by the polymeric matrix of Semtex 1H (Sem-BC+HMX) was studied. The particle size distribution of each individual explosive was determined to obtain the optimum mixing conditions. Friction and impact sensitivities were determined. The velocity of detonation was reported practically and the detonation properties were calculated by EXPLO5 code. The explosive strength of each sample was measured by the ballistic mortar test. The conclusion confirms that the velocity of detonation of Sem-BC+HMX was the highest in comparison with the prepared samples. Sem-BC+RDX has the least impact and frictions sensitivities. Sem-BC+RDX has higher detonation velocity, detonation properties and explosive strength than Semtex 1H.

These novel equation-of-state measurements are a critical step toward understanding TATB in its most fundamental form and improving predictive modeling of TATB-based explosives.  © 2020 Author(s).","Marshall M.C., Fernandez-Pañella A., Myers T.W., Eggert J.H., Erskine D.J., Bastea S., Fried L.E., Leininger L.D.",57208671849;53984048300;41361637200;7005175974;7004512673;6603349764;35571274400;57225225888;,"Shock Hugoniot measurements of single-crystal 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) compressed to 83 GPa",2020,Journal of Applied Physics,127,18,185901,,,NA,17,10.1063/5.0005818,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089532688&doi=10.1063%2f5.0005818&partnerID=40&md5=183ca11faf0f76c283a564ac93993729,"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States","Marshall, M.C., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Fernandez-Pañella, A., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Myers, T.W., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Eggert, J.H., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Erskine, D.J., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Bastea, S., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Fried, L.E., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Leininger, L.D., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States",,"Binders; Equations of state; Explosives; Predictive analytics; Ultrafast lasers; 1 , 3 , 5-triamino-2 , 4 , 6-trinitrobenzene; Critical steps; Laser driven shocks; Lower pressures; Measurements of; Novel equation; Predictive modeling; Shock Hugoniot; Single crystals","Marshall, M.C.; Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States; email: marshall47@llnl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85083757657,"The treatment of some industrial wastewaters is complex, since they usually contain complex non-biodegradable organic compounds or toxic compounds which are not easily treatable. These compounds are not removed by biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants and they may affect the removal of ammonium, nitrate, organic nitrogen by these treatment systems. Therefore, this research proposes a new and innovative low-cost and easy-to-apply pre-treatment to treat low biodegradable and high nitrogen wastewaters, using explosive wastewaters as case study. The pre-treatment is composed by immediate one-step lime precipitation (IOSLM) and atmospheric CO2 carbonation (AC) processes. The novelty of the proposed pre-treatment is based firstly on the use of one reactant (hydrated lime) at high concentrations, added in one step, that produces immediately an abundant and insoluble precipitate able to sweep the organic matter and other contaminants from wastewater in a short time and ensure conditions (pH and Ca2+) for the AC process. Secondly, the AC process uses the sludge produced in IOSLM to keep pH high for longer, allowing ammonia removal while simultaneously the pH is reduced by spontaneous reactions with atmospheric CO2. IOSLM results showed 92.1 %, 98.2 % and 100 % of organic matter, oils and fats, and organic nitrogen removals, respectively, for the optimal hydrated lime dose (7.76 g L-1). In AC process 61 % of ammonium nitrogen was removed and pH reduced to 8.1 in 10 days. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.","Madeira L., Almeida A., Ribau Teixeira M., Prazeres A., Chaves H., Carvalho F.",55760206500;57192670149;57904675400;36614671400;57197792029;7103070446;,Immediate one-step lime precipitation and atmospheric carbonation as pre-treatment for low biodegradable and high nitrogen wastewaters: A case study of explosives industry,2020,Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,8,3,103808,,,NA,20,10.1016/j.jece.2020.103808,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083757657&doi=10.1016%2fj.jece.2020.103808&partnerID=40&md5=27c3934816db8abe647abbb53ccb2389,"Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, Edifício 7, Faro, 8005-139, Portugal; Departamento de Tecnologias e Ciências Aplicadas, Instituto Politécnico de Beja (IPBeja), Ap 158, Beja, 7801-902, Portugal; CENSE, Center for Environmental and Sustainability Research, Campus da Caparica, Caparica, 2829-516, Portugal; FiberEnTech, Fiber Materials and Environmental Technologies, Rua Marquês d'Ávila e Bolama, Covilhã, 6201-001, Portugal; CEBAL, Centro de Biotecnologia Agrícola e Agro-Alimentar Do Alentejo/IPBeja/ MED, Mediterranean Institute for Agriculture, Environment and Development, Beja, 7801-908, Portugal","Madeira, L., Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, Edifício 7, Faro, 8005-139, Portugal, Departamento de Tecnologias e Ciências Aplicadas, Instituto Politécnico de Beja (IPBeja), Ap 158, Beja, 7801-902, Portugal; Almeida, A., Departamento de Tecnologias e Ciências Aplicadas, Instituto Politécnico de Beja (IPBeja), Ap 158, Beja, 7801-902, Portugal; Ribau Teixeira, M., Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, Edifício 7, Faro, 8005-139, Portugal, CENSE, Center for Environmental and Sustainability Research, Campus da Caparica, Caparica, 2829-516, Portugal; Prazeres, A., FiberEnTech, Fiber Materials and Environmental Technologies, Rua Marquês d'Ávila e Bolama, Covilhã, 6201-001, Portugal, CEBAL, Centro de Biotecnologia Agrícola e Agro-Alimentar Do Alentejo/IPBeja/ MED, Mediterranean Institute for Agriculture, Environment and Development, Beja, 7801-908, Portugal; Chaves, H., Departamento de Tecnologias e Ciências Aplicadas, Instituto Politécnico de Beja (IPBeja), Ap 158, Beja, 7801-902, Portugal; Carvalho, F., Departamento de Tecnologias e Ciências Aplicadas, Instituto Politécnico de Beja (IPBeja), Ap 158, Beja, 7801-902, Portugal",Ammonia; Atmospheric CO2 carbonation; Explosives wastewater; Immediate one-step lime precipitation; Low biodegradable organic matter; Sludge,Ammonia; Biogeochemistry; Biological water treatment; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Explosives; Hydrated lime; Hydration; Industrial water treatment; Lime; Nitrogen; Oils and fats; Wastewater treatment; Ammonium nitrogen; Atmospheric carbonations; Biological treatment; Industrial wastewaters; Lime precipitations; Spontaneous reactions; Treatment systems; Wastewater treatment plants; Nitrogen removal,"Ribau Teixeira, M.; Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Edifício 7, Portugal; email: mribau@ualg.pt",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85084626037,"Atomic Force Microscopy coupled with Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (AFM-TERS) was applied to obtain information about the structure and surface composition of single nano co-crystals. For this purpose, a co-crystalline system consisting of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazatetracyclo-[5.5.0.03,11.05,9]-dodecane (CL-20) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 (CL-20/HMX) was chosen. CL-20/HMX nano-plates were prepared by spray flash evaporation. To ensure co-crystallinity and nanostructures, powder X-ray diffraction and AFM investigations were performed. The results demonstrate that coherence lengths and particle dimensions are on a similar level though coherence lengths appear shorter than measured particle dimensions. According to this fact, defects inside the nano co-crystals are minimized. The co-crystallinity was additionally proven by confocal Raman spectroscopy. Here, marker bands for pristine CL-20 and HMX were chosen which appear in the CL-20/HMX spectrum in an intensity ratio of ∼2.5 : 1 (CL-20 : HMX). Afterwards surface investigations of single CL-20/HMX nano-plates were performed by AFM-TERS. Due to the surface sensitivity of TERS, these experiments reveal that the ratio of the Raman intensities between CL-20 and HMX inverts at CL-20/HMX nano-plate surfaces. Therefore, it is concluded that nano co-crystal surfaces consist of molecular layers of HMX. A theoretical approximation of the normal coordinates of the investigated marker vibrations supports this conclusion since it can exclude the occurrence of the intensity ratio inversion because of the given orientation between CL-20/HMX nano-plates and the Raman scattering system. Based on this finding, an impact ignition mechanism is proposed, enabling explanation of the close impact sensitivity values of β-HMX and CL-20/HMX.","Hübner J., Deckert-Gaudig T., Glorian J., Deckert V., Spitzer D.",55812132000;24168168000;56311961700;55222532900;56213346200;,Surface characterization of nanoscale co-crystals enabled through tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy,2020,Nanoscale,12,18,,10306,10319,NA,12,10.1039/d0nr00397b,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084626037&doi=10.1039%2fd0nr00397b&partnerID=40&md5=567f7191cc706e0aadbf32e9cafb4812,"Nanomatériaux pour les Systèmes Sous Sollicitations Extrêmes (NS3E), French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, France. and French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France; Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT), Albert-Einsteinstr. 9, Jena, 07745, Germany; French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France; Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT), Albert-Einsteinstr. 9, 07745 Jena, Germany and Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Helmholtzweg 4, 07743 Jena, Germany and Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-4242, USA; Nanomatériaux pour les Systèmes Sous Sollicitations Extrêmes (NS3E), French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, France. and French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France","Hübner, J., Nanomatériaux pour les Systèmes Sous Sollicitations Extrêmes (NS3E), French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, France. and French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France; Deckert-Gaudig, T., Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT), Albert-Einsteinstr. 9, Jena, 07745, Germany; Glorian, J., French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France; Deckert, V., Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT), Albert-Einsteinstr. 9, 07745 Jena, Germany and Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Helmholtzweg 4, 07743 Jena, Germany and Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-4242, USA; Spitzer, D., Nanomatériaux pour les Systèmes Sous Sollicitations Extrêmes (NS3E), French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, France. and French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, rue du Général Cassagnou ,B.P. 70034, France",,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85075454978,"The study is devoted to the electrochemical detection of trace explosives on boron-doped diamond/graphene nanowall electrodes (B:DGNW). The electrodes were fabricated in a one-step growth process using chemical vapour deposition without any additional modifications. The electrochemical investigations were focused on the determination of the important nitroaromatic explosive compounds, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4,6-trinitroanisole (TNA). The distinct reduction peaks of both studied compounds were observed regardless of the pH value of the solution. The reduction peak currents were linearly related to the concentration of TNT and TNA in the range from 0.05–15 ppm. Nevertheless, two various linear trends were observed, attributed respectively to the adsorption processes at low concentrations up to the diffusional character of detection for larger contamination levels. The limit of detection of TNT and TNA is equal to 73 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively. Moreover, the proposed detection strategy has been applied under real conditions with a significant concentration of interfering compounds – in landfill leachates. The proposed bare B:DGNW electrodes were revealed to have a high electroactive area towards the voltammetric determination of various nitroaromatic compounds with a high rate of repeatability, thus appearing to be an attractive nanocarbon surface for further applications. © 2019 The Authors","Dettlaff A., Jakóbczyk P., Ficek M., Wilk B., Szala M., Wojtas J., Ossowski T., Bogdanowicz R.",57033988700;57218600906;55828787700;57209796690;8921001100;12241107000;55907187700;6507116472;,"Electrochemical determination of nitroaromatic explosives at boron-doped diamond/graphene nanowall electrodes: 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and 2,4,6-trinitroanisole in liquid effluents",2020,Journal of Hazardous Materials,387,,121672,,,NA,62,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121672,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075454978&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.121672&partnerID=40&md5=ec6708efc4e3cc67a532b8ede4366f98,"Gdańsk University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Narutowicza 11/12, Gdańsk, 80-233, Poland; Gdańsk University of Technology, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Narutowicza 11/12, Gdańsk, 80-233, Poland; Military University of Technology, S.

Typical molecular rotors such as triphenylamine (TPA) and tetraphenylethene (TPE) as B2-, and A4- A nd A3-type nodes have been used to construct AIEE-active CMOS, namely, CMO1 and CMO2. The quick dissipation of the excited photons is successfully controlled by the restriction of rotation of the phenyl units through the formation of a mesoporous network scaffold in a solid/thin film, which provides high quantum yields for the interlocked CMO system. Both the CMOS are sensitive and selective to the various nitroaromatic explosives, whereas CMO1 is more sensitive (Ksv = 2.6 × 106 M-1) toward picric acid. The increased quenching constant for CMO1 is due to its increased quantum yield and high energy-transfer efficiency. The mechanism for sensing has been studied in detail. The larger pore size and pore density in the mesoporous network of CMO1 are found to be responsible for the greater extent of energy transfer from CMO1 to picric acid. Furthermore, CMO1 has been employed for low-cost filter-paper-based detection of a trace amount of nitroaromatic explosive materials.

2-s2.0-85091119120,"For sensitive and reproducible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based trace detection, a SERS platform with high concentration of homogeneously distributed hotspots is needed. Herein, we report a facile monolayer assembly of multispiked gold nanoparticles (MSGNPs) of various sizes over a large area. The assembly was achieved simply by tuning the concentration of MSGNPs in a suspension and subsequently drying it on a substrate under ambient conditions. A monolayer assembly for MSGNP sizes ranging from 150 to 640 nm has been demonstrated. The MSGNP assembly showed excellent sensitivity and uniformity of SERS-based trace detection, owing to the presence of high concentration of uniformly distributed interparticle and intraparticle hotspots. In particular, detection of 10 fM of a toxic dye, crystal violet, has been demonstrated.

2-s2.0-85077215979,"Currently, urea containing frameworks assumed to have a prominent role in the developing field of Y shapes anion detection such as TNP, TNT and their derivatives owing to their capability to act as double H-bond donors. Developing new and highly efficient sensors for detection of trace concentration of these explosives is remaining challenge. The immobilization of organic–functional struts within the pore wall of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is one of the new strategies to develop highly sensitive and selective receptors. Decoration of MOF skeleton with urea moiety can be helpful in effective recognizing of these specific guests for two reasons, (i) incorporation of urea strut in the framework prevents their inherent self-assembly and (ii) urea can form positive double hydrogen bond donation site which can act as a promising receptor for anionic moieties. A 3D, urea functionalized, TMU-18, has successfully synthesized as a chemosensor for selective detection by fluorescence signaling towards explosive nitroaromatics and carbonyl compounds. TMU-18 due to its special and porous structure and available functional group shows strong luminescence emission, and could be effectively used for sensitive detection of Trinitrophenol (TNP) with a 10 µM limit of detection (LOD). © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Sharafizadeh M., Mokhtari J., Saeidian H., Mirjafary Z.",57212602763;57190577397;15136960300;23005213500;,Urea metal-organic frameworks as a highly selective fluorescent sensor for the explosive nitroaromatics and carbonyl compounds,2020,Journal of Porous Materials,27,2,,603,609,NA,12,10.1007/s10934-019-00842-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077215979&doi=10.1007%2fs10934-019-00842-7&partnerID=40&md5=e19f27dab13b6dc20433d02b6f5519c0,"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran; Department of Science, Payame Noor University (PNU), P.O.

Many explosives incident reports involve an inorganic oxidizer-fuel mixture which can include pyrotechnics, fireworks, flash powders, black powders, black powder substitutes, and improvised or homemade explosives. A portable CE instrument with targeted analysis of common inorganic oxidizer ions, for example, chlorate, perchlorate, and nitrate, was used here as a rapid detection platform. Unlike frequently used gas-phase separation and detection instrumentation such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), an automated liquid extraction mechanism is required for CE separation using acetate paper sample collection wipes. Target inorganic oxidizers were inkjet-printed onto sample wipes to investigate instrument response relative to the collected analyte spatial distribution. Overall, analyte signal intensities increased with off-center sample deposition due to improved sample extraction from wipes and no change in response was observed for varied array distributions across wipes.

2-s2.0-85079432623,"Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) represent the leading causes for casualties among civilians and soldiers in the present war (including counter-terrorism). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by IEDs results in different degrees of impairment of cognition and behavior, but the exact brain pathophysiological mechanism following exposure to blast has not been clearly investigated. Here, we sought to establish a rat model of closed-head blast injury using compressed gas to deliver a single blast only to the brain without systemic injuries. The cognitive functions of these bTBI models were assessed by Morris Water Maze test (MWM test). The HE staining, flow cytometry, ELISA and Western Blotting were used to measure the effects of shock wave on general histology, regulatory T (Treg) cells percentage, inflammatory reactions, the expression and phosphorylation level of tau, respectively. In addition, the brain water content and 24 -h mortality were also assessed. As the distance from the blast source increased, the input pressure did not change, the overpressure decreased, and the mortality decreased. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting 24 -h mortality using peak overpressure fits with the following areas under ROC curves: 0.833. In 2 weeks after blast injury, cognitive tests revealed significantly decreased performance at 20 cm distance from the blast (about 136.44 kPa) as demonstrated by increased escape latency in the acquisition phase, and decreased crossing numbers in the probe phase of MWM test. Interestingly, a single blast exposure (at 20 cm) lead to significantly increased tau phosphorylation at the Thr205 epitope but not at the Ser404 and Ser262 epitopes at 12 h, 24 h, 3d, and 7d after blast injury. Blast decreased the percentage of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, Treg cells and lymphocytes at different time points after blast injury, and blast increased the percentage of neutrophils at 12 h after blast injury and significantly increased IL-6 production at 12 h, 24 h and 3d after blast injury. In addition, blast lead to an increase of brain edema at 24 h and 3d after blast injury. However, no obvious alterations in brain gross pathology were found acutely in the blast-exposed rats. In conclusion, we established a rat model of simple craniocerebral blast injury characterized by impairment of cognitive function, Thr205 phosphorylation of tau, decreased Treg cells and increased inflammatory reactions and brain edema. We expect this model may help clarify the underlying mechanism after blast injury and possibly serve as a useful animal model in the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Shi Q.-X., Chen B., Nie C., Zhao Z.-P., Zhang J.-H., Si S.-Y., Cui S.-J., Gu J.-W.",56399925400;57748823100;56661837500;57214882193;55756302900;8377064700;55137862800;26643366100;,A novel model of blast induced traumatic brain injury caused by compressed gas produced sustained cognitive deficits in rats: involvement of phosphorylation of tau at the Thr205 epitope,2020,Brain Research Bulletin,157,,,149,161,NA,17,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2020.02.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079432623&doi=10.1016%2fj.brainresbull.2020.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=ba8d6cf3d137670cdcb32894a7d5cdad,"Department of Graduate School, The Third Military Medical University (Army Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China; Savaid Medical College, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Department of Ophthalmology, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100101, China; Department of Neurosurgery, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Department of Pathology and Experimental Medicine, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China","Shi, Q.-X., Department of Graduate School, The Third Military Medical University (Army Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China, Department of Neurosurgery, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Chen, B., Savaid Medical College, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Nie, C., Department of Ophthalmology, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Zhao, Z.-P., School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100101, China; Zhang, J.-H., Department of Neurosurgery, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Si, S.-Y., Department of Pathology and Experimental Medicine, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Cui, S.-J., Department of Neurosurgery, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China; Gu, J.-W., Department of Neurosurgery, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, The 306th Hospital, Beijing, 100101, China",Blast; Cognitive function; Rat; Tau; Traumatic brain injury,"eosin; epitope; hematoxylin; interleukin 6; tau protein; threonine; epitope; tau protein; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; blast injury; brain; brain edema; brain histology; brain water; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cognition; cognitive defect; compressed air; controlled study; cytokine production; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; escape latency; experimental traumatic brain injury; flow cytometry; gas; histopathology; hyperbarism; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; lymphocyte; male; Morris water maze test; mortality; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; rat model; receiver operating characteristic; regulatory T lymphocyte; shock wave; spatial memory; Sprague Dawley rat; staining; Western blotting; animal; cognitive defect; disease model; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; traumatic brain injury; Animals; Blast Injuries; Brain; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Epitopes; Male; Rats; tau Proteins","Gu, J.-W.; Department of Neurosurgery, The 306th Hospital, China; email: gujianwen196606@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

In order to predict ignition and deflagration of propellants containing these ingredients, their thermal decomposition behaviors must be thoroughly understood. In this study, the thermal decomposition of HMX was investigated using synergetic application of experimental and computational methods. Mole fraction profiles of the gaseous decomposition products evolving from the liquid-phase HMX were obtained using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for two types of thermolysis experiments – thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and confined rapid thermolysis (CRT). Four heating rates (5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min) in TGA experiments and four set temperatures (290, 300, 310 and 320 °C) in CRT experiments were considered. In the TGA and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, steep mass loss and rapid decomposition were observed after the melting of the HMX at 280 °C. CH2O and N2O were identified as the major decomposition products. Smaller quantities of H2O, HCN, NO and NO2, CO and CO2 were also formed. In the complementary computational study, liquid-phase elementary reactions were investigated using quantum mechanics calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). A zero-dimensional model was developed to simulate the TGA and CRT experiments based on conservation of mass and species in the condensed-phase and the gas-phase control volumes. The predicted mass loss and gas-phase mole fraction profiles of the decomposition products are in good agreements with the corresponding experimental results, indicating that the comprehensive mechanism proposed here captures the important reactions occurring during liquid-phase decomposition of HMX. © 2019","Patidar L., Khichar M., Thynell S.T.",56274304100;57196403992;7003318251;,"A comprehensive mechanism for liquid-phase decomposition of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX): Thermolysis experiments and detailed kinetic modeling",2020,Combustion and Flame,212,,,67,78,NA,17,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.10.025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074163124&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.10.025&partnerID=40&md5=1f7a94bdbfdd5e3cf97a5ffbdd4d32b2,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, United States","Patidar, L., Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, United States; Khichar, M., Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, United States; Thynell, S.T., Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, United States",FTIR spectroscopy; HMX; Reaction mechanism; TGA; Thermal decomposition,"Combustion; Computation theory; Conservation; Continuum mechanics; Differential scanning calorimetry; Explosives; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gases; HMX; Liquids; Pyrolysis; Quantum theory; Solid propellants; Thermogravimetric analysis; Computational studies; Decomposition products; Detailed kinetic modeling; FTIR spectroscopy; Polarizable continuum model; Reaction mechanism; Thermal decomposition behavior; Zero-dimensional models; Thermolysis; 1,3,5 trinitro 1,3,5 triazinane; 1,3,5,7 tetranitro 1,3,5,7 tetrazoctane; isosorbide mononitrate; propellant; unclassified drug; Article; combustion; computer model; confined rapid thermolysis; decomposition; differential scanning calorimetry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gas; heating; liquid; mathematical analysis; melting point; molecular dynamics; molecular weight; polarization; priority journal; quantum mechanics; reaction analysis; thermogravimetry","Thynell, S.T.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, United States; email: thynell@psu.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85079359059,"Existing ground-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems provide a good potential for standoff detection of explosives and their traces. The current technology, however, has still essential challenges to achieve a generic surveillance system for dynamic scenes with moving vehicles. In this regard, part I of this two-part article presents a state-of-the-art of existing HSI systems for explosive detection and discusses the future challenges for such a surveillance system. Considering the utilization of a light source and the operating spectral region, the presented overview classifies the related HSI systems as active and passive systems in the long-wave and short-wave infrared spectra, and investigates the methods in each class with respect to the targeted explosives, illumination and capturing devices, target detection algorithms, and performance evaluation methodologies. The investigation has revealed the major challenges for a generic surveillance system as 1) a thorough experimental performance validation with respect to time, date, and orientation, 2) sufficient acquisition speeds to capture moving vehicles, 3) registration and regulation of different spectral bands captured at different positions of the movement in a dynamic scene, 4) lower false positive rates required for the dynamic scenes compared to static control points, and 5) white reference compensations for the reflectance conversion in a continuous and secure surveillance system.

2-s2.0-85067261464,"The hexanitrostilben (HNS) is a thermally stable explosive that can be prepared from hexanitrobibenzyl (HNBB). Therefore, the investigation of thermal stability of HNBB can be important in the yield of preparation of HNS. The decomposition kinetic of HNBB and HNS are studied by non-isothermal gravimetric method. The TG/DTG curves in non-isothermal method are obtained in range of 25°C–400 °C at heating rates of 3 °C/min, 5 °C/min, 8 °C/min, 10 °C/min and 12 °C/min. The data of weight-temperature are used for calculation of activation energy (Ea) of thermal decomposition reactions by methods of Ozawa, Kissinger, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) as model-free methods and Strink's equation as model-fitting method. The compensation effect is used for prediction of mechanism and determination of pre-exponential factor (lnA) of the decomposition reaction. A reduction 60 kj/mol for the average of activation energy of thermal decomposition reaction of HNBB is obtained versus HNS. This result shows the lower thermal stability of HNBB in comparison to HNS.

2-s2.0-85092639548,"The issue of detecting improvised explosive devices, henceforth IEDs, in rural or built-up urban environments is a persistent and serious concern for governments in the developing world. In many cases, such devices are plastic, or varied metallic objects containing rudimentary explosives, which are not visible to the naked eye and are difficult to detect autonomously. The most effective strategy for detecting land mines also happens to be the most dangerous. This paper intends to leverage the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to aid in the discovery of such IEDs. As part of a related project, an autonomous sensor array was used to detect the devices in terrains too hazardous for a human to survey. This paper presents a CNN and its training methodology, suitable to make use of the sensor system. This convolutional neural network can accurately distinguish between a potential IED and surrounding undergrowth and natural features of the environment in real-time. The training methodology enabled the CNN to successfully recognise the IEDs with an accuracy of 98.7%, in well-lit conditions. The results are evaluated against other convolutional neural systems as well as against a deterministic algorithm, showing that the proposed CNN outperforms its competitors including the deterministic method.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

2-s2.0-85076808860,"Four new conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) were synthesized by a Buchwald-Hartwig (BH) cross-coupling reaction of tri-and tetrafunctionalized precursors to yield materials with tunable surface area and pore size distribution. This approach yielded LPCMP1-4, CMPs with significantly higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (more than 5 times higher) than other related BH-based CMPs. These CMPs possess not only high BET specific surface areas and high chemical and thermal stabilities, but also exhibit outstanding swellability. To the best of our knowledge, swellable behavior was studied in great detail for CMPs for the first time, with the greatest degree of swelling for methanol reaching 16.5 and 16.3 mL g-1 for LPCMP1 and LPCMP3, respectively. Owing to their excellent swellability, we further studied the adsorption capacity of these CMPs for different toxic organic vapors (including toluene and methanol). LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 adsorbed 124 and 117 mg g-1 toluene, respectively, at saturated vapor pressure. For methanol, the adsorption capacities of LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 were up to 250 and 215 mg g-1, respectively, which are the highest recorded values when compared with published data for CMPs, HCPs, MOFs, and porous carbons. These materials are promising candidates for the removal and elimination of hazardous organic vapors and chemical warfare agents. Moreover, all the polymers show high sensitivity to nitroaromatic explosives. LPCMP2 and LPCMP4 exhibit high selectivity for TNT and may be suitable as new candidates to selectively detect TNT for security or environmental applications.

2-s2.0-85069935286,"Abstract: To improve the thermal decomposition property of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), a new nano-energetic combustion catalyst nitrated graphene oxide (NGO), which was synthesized by nitrifying graphene oxide with nitro-sulfuric acid, is introduced to RDX via a solvent–antisolvent method. A scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the morphology of RDX, NGO and the 2% NGO/RDX nano-energetic composite. The properties and the mechanisms of thermal decomposition of the NGO/RDX nano-energetic composites in different blend ratios were analyzed through thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry–mass spectra, respectively. In comparison with RDX, the thermal decomposition temperature of 2%NGO/RDX decreased from 246 to 224 °C, and the apparent decomposition heat enhanced from 761 to 1651 J g−1. The tests of impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity were carried out by a standard method. The value of h50 of 2%NGO/RDX increased from 24 to 40 cm and the friction sensitivity of 2%NGO/RDX reduced from 86 to 12% compared with RDX. These results indicated that NGO had an excellent catalytic property upon the thermal decomposition of RDX and it can also improve its impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity.

2-s2.0-85125981834,"Military firing or shooting ranges exhibit the most significant environmental concern of the current era. The copresence of diverse types of organic (TNT, RDX, and HMX) and inorganic pollutants (Pb, Cu, Cd, Ni, Cr, Zn, As, and Sb) can cause endless damage to the environment. Therefore the presence of these pollutants at a single site makes them a good option for studying the behavior and transformation mechanisms of both types of pollutants. Traditional remediation approaches can render the toxicity of pollutants at these sites. However, they are not preferred due to their high cost, low public acceptability, indirect harm to the environment, and more labor involvement. Contrary to it, such sites that are highly contaminated with organic pollutants, metals, and metal(loid)s can be managed by using various approaches like bioremediation, bacterial degradation/transformation, phytoremediation, phytoextraction, immobilization, and combination of these techniques. Likewise the sites polluted with organic explosives, strategies like phytotransformation, bioremediation, bioaugmentation, and photolysis are recommended, which can reduce the levels of toxicants by their transformation, degradation, and conversion into nontoxic forms, whereas phytoextraction, bacterial transformation, in situ immobilization, and phytostabilization can deem the risk of inorganic pollutants at such sites. By undertaking these techniques and management practices, the harm to the environment from these polluted shooting ranges can be scaled down. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

2-s2.0-85068652350,"Potassium chlorate is a powerful oxidizer salt that, when mixed with a fuel source, has been used as a homemade explosive (HME). As an inorganic salt, potassium chlorate has no appreciable vapor pressure under ambient conditions and requires temperatures exceeding 300 °C for decomposition. However, detection of potassium chlorate by trained canines has been demonstrated, implying that it exudes a vapor signature with one or more volatile compounds, although no such species have been confirmed to date. In this work, solid-phase microextraction with a novel on-fiber derivatization reaction was used to interrogate the headspace of several potassium chlorate samples of varying purity, as well as that of related chlorinated salts and explosive mixtures. This analysis showed the presence of few volatile species in the headspace of potassium chlorate other than vaporous chlorine, detected as the derivatized product, chloro-2-propanol. Relative amounts of chloro-2-propanol could be compared between potassium chlorate variants, and could be detected in the presence of other volatile species associated with the fuels. © 2019","Crespo Cajigas J.M., Perez-Almodovar L., DeGreeff L.E.",57209771661;57209249629;36992911500;,Headspace analysis of potassium chlorate using on-fiber SPME derivatization coupled with GC/MS,2019,Talanta,205,,120127,,,NA,10,10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120127,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068652350&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2019.120127&partnerID=40&md5=24a91c12ae63560f63b17329c291add1,"University of Puerto Rico, PR-108, Mayaguez, 00682, Puerto Rico; Chemistry Division, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C., 20375, United States","Crespo Cajigas, J.M., University of Puerto Rico, PR-108, Mayaguez, 00682, Puerto Rico; Perez-Almodovar, L., University of Puerto Rico, PR-108, Mayaguez, 00682, Puerto Rico; DeGreeff, L.E., Chemistry Division, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C., 20375, United States",Chlorine detection; Homemade explosives; On-fiber derivatization; Potassium chlorate; Solid phase microextraction,Explosives; Explosives detection; Extraction; Propanol; Volatile organic compounds; Ambient conditions; Chlorine detection; Explosive mixtures; Headspace analysis; On-fiber derivatization; Potassium chlorates; Solid-phase microextraction; Volatile compounds; Potash,"DeGreeff, L.E.; Chemistry Division, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, United States; email: lauryn.degreeff@nrl.navy.mil",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85077762223,"Drop-weight impact tests are used routinely to characterize the handling safety of explosives. Numerous studies have sought to connect various physical and chemical properties of the energetic molecules and materials to their measured impact sensitivities. Wenograd in the early 1960s demonstrated that there is a strong dependency of the drop-heights on the critical temperatures required for explosives to undergo prompt reactions. Reactive quantum molecular dynamics simulations with the lanl31 density functional tight binding model have been used to compute the delay time before the thermal explosion of the secondary explosives erythritol tetranitrate (ETN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), trinitrotolune (TNT), and 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) as a function of the initial temperature and pressure. The delay time to explosion data are consistent with Arrhenius chemical kinetics, which is expected for thermally activated processes in materials and in accord with experimental measurements. The critical temperatures required for the materials to undergo prompt explosions display the same dependence on drop height as was observed by Wenograd. Hence, quantum-based reactive molecular dynamics simulations are potentially a tool for ranking the drop-weight impact sensitivity and handling safety of explosives.

FTIR study and nitrite assay confirmed the degradation of RDX into non-toxic metabolites in an RDX-succinate aqueous medium. The isolate showed an improved RDX degradation when formulated into water dispersible granules (WDG) using soy flour as a nutrient source. The WDG formulation not only achieved 6.53% enhanced RDX degradation but also stabilized the microbe as only a 24.37% decrease in cfu count was observed after a storage period of six months at 30 ºC. During the microcosm experiments, RDX degradation followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 13.9 and 19.04 days in a soil biostimulated by sucrose and wheat straw, respectively. P. aquatica with sucrose as added carbon source effectively degraded 50.91% more RDX compared to unstimulated control after 30 days of treatment.

In this work, the sensing chromophores were dendritic side chains attached to a norbornenyl-derived polymer backbone. The sensing chromophore of each poly(dendrimer) was based on fluorene and carbazole moieties, both of which have been shown to be sensitive toward nitro-containing explosives. The monomers, and corresponding polymers, were screened against 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB) vapors and a range of household interferents such as mouthwash and ethanol. An important result of this work was the rapid and sensitive detection of DMNB, a taggant added to commercial plastic explosives, which is usually difficult to detect via fluorescence quenching due to its relatively low electron affinity and spontaneous diffusion out of the sensing film. Testing of the poly(dendrimer)s was also performed with a hand-held prototype detector for explosives. Selectivity was demonstrated with a range of interferents and explosive or taggant vapors, with the interferents giving an increase in fluorescence intensity and the explosive related materials a quenching of the luminescence.

2-s2.0-85072190954,"We report numerical simulations undertaken to understand the effects of a protective dike near an underground high-explosive storage facility. Our numerical model allowed us to estimate the peak overpressure of a blast wave around an underground magazine with or without a dike. We varied the internal length-to-diameter ratio of the underground magazine to compare the effects of magazine length. We found that the dike prevented the blast wave and detonation products from expanding along the exit direction and mitigated the peak overpressure near the dike. Our simulated results for peak overpressures outside the magazine on the ground agreed well with experimental results. The azimuthal characteristics, how the peak overpressure was reduced by the increment of the azimuth angle, were independent of the internal length-to-diameter ratio of the magazine. The presence of a dike, however, does change the shape of the iso-peak overpressure zone around the magazine exit which would determine the explosive safety quantity–distance. With a dike, the iso-peak overpressure zone is a circle, and it is an ellipse without the dike on the ground. The parameters to describe these shapes can be expressed as a linear function of the radius of the iso-peak overpressure zone of a surface explosion without any models on the ground. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Sugiyama Y., Wakabayashi K., Matsumura T., Nakayama Y.",56374194300;7402088088;7402226896;35264490100;,Numerical study of the effect of high-explosive storage facility shape on the azimuthal distribution of blast-wave pressures,2020,"European Journal of Mechanics, B/Fluids",79,,,153,164,NA,10,10.1016/j.euromechflu.2019.09.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072190954&doi=10.1016%2fj.euromechflu.2019.09.008&partnerID=40&md5=4543e8ccb75441fb98719b76e43e2001,"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan","Sugiyama, Y., National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Wakabayashi, K., National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Matsumura, T., National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan; Nakayama, Y., National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki  305-8565, Japan",Azimuthal distribution; Blast wave; Dike; Numerical simulation; Storage facility shape,Computer simulation; Explosives; Levees; Numerical models; Azimuthal distributions; Blast waves; Detonation product; Peak overpressure; Peak overpressures; Simulated results; Storage facilities; Surface explosions; Hydraulic structures,"Sugiyama, Y.; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Japan; email: yuta.sugiyama@aist.go.jp",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85077371020,"The thermal decomposition reactions of ammonium nitrate (AN) are reviewed. Both neat AN and AN containing various contaminants are examined, however quantitative kinetics results are not encompassed. Also not included is the performance of AN as the oxidizer in rocket propellants or in explosives such as ANFO. The review is intended to be the most comprehensive review of decomposition reactions of AN since Berthelot's treatise of 1892. Despite hundreds of papers on the topic that have appeared in the intervening years, understanding of decomposition mechanisms remains only modestly more complete than it was in Berthelot's day. However, some additional reaction steps and mechanisms have been identified and these are discussed. Explosions of AN most commonly involve fire as the proximate cause, yet chemical-mechanism research on the topic is nil. A modest number of studies have explored the potentiation of AN decomposition by organic contaminants. These have, thus far, not produced guidance useful for promoting of safety from fire-related causes. Contamination from inorganic sources, notably chlorides is better understood and some mechanisms have been studied. The UN classification of AN as an oxidizer, instead of as an explosive, should not be interpreted literally, since AN has been associated with numerous detonation disasters. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Babrauskas V., Leggett D.",7006694977;57213877899;,Thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate,2020,Fire and Materials,44,2,,250,268,NA,57,10.1002/fam.2797,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077371020&doi=10.1002%2ffam.2797&partnerID=40&md5=d735d08a554a81daf098237322258a04,"Fire Science and Technology Inc., New York, NY, United States; John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, NY, United States; Leggett Technical Consulting, Playa del Rey, CA, United States","Babrauskas, V., Fire Science and Technology Inc., New York, NY, United States, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, NY, United States; Leggett, D., Leggett Technical Consulting, Playa del Rey, CA, United States",ammonium nitrate; contaminants; explosives; oxidizing agents; reviews; thermal decomposition,Chlorine compounds; Contamination; Decomposition; Impurities; Nitrates; Pyrolysis; Reviews; Rockets; Thermolysis; Additional reactions; Ammonium nitrate; Decomposition mechanism; Decomposition reaction; Organic contaminant; Oxidizing agents; Quantitative kinetics; Thermal decomposition reaction; Explosives,"Babrauskas, V.; Fire Science and Technology Inc.United States; email: vytob@doctorfire.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85074754684,"Bistetrazole energetic ionic salts, such as dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50) and diamino 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (ABTOX), are new insensitive materials and have great potential applications because of their good energy and safety performance. Prior to pure explosive preparation into PBX, the interactions between the components must be evaluated. Examination of interactions between bistetrazole ionic salt and ammonium nitrate explosive in thermal decomposition is beneficial in revealing the interactive mechanism of these two kinds of energetic materials in decomposition, as well as in the evaluation of compatibility, safety, and reliability of PBX explosive based on TKX-50, ABTOX, HMX, and RDX. Herein, the thermal decomposition behavior of TKX-50/HMX, ABTOX/HMX, TKX-50/RDX, and ABTOX/RDX is investigated. Ammonium nitrate explosives can significantly reduce the thermal decomposition peak temperature of the bistetrazole ionic salt. For example, HMX reduces the decomposition peak temperatures of the first and second stages of TKX-50 by 4 and 15 K, respectively, and ABTOX by 26 K (heating rate 5 K min−1). Utilizing HMX, the interaction mechanism between ammonium nitrate explosives and bistetrazole ionic material in thermal decomposition was investigated in detail. Changes in gas products, morphology, and molecular structure of the materials during decomposition show that TKX-50 induces HMX to HONO elimination decomposition, while ABTOX induces HMX open-loop decomposition. Furthermore, the heat generated by HMX decomposition accelerates the decomposition of TKX-50 and ABTOX. Moreover, the melting characteristics of HMX and molten product formation in the decomposition of TKX-50 and ABTOX promote the interaction between solid phase materials. Additionally, using calculation simulation, we confirmed that NH3OH+ in TKX-50 transfers hydrogen to the HMX nitro group, resulting in the HONO elimination of HMX, while the bistetrazole N-oxide anion in ABTOX and its alkaline decomposition intermediate product captures the hydrogen of the HMX main ring and causes HMX ring-opening decomposition. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Zhao C., Chi Y., Yu Q., Wang X., Fan G., Yu K.",15761458500;16063349600;57191500663;55165008500;55568138300;55842305300;,Comprehensive Study of the Interaction and Mechanism between Bistetrazole Ionic Salt and Ammonium Nitrate Explosive in Thermal Decomposition,2019,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,,,,,,NA,14,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05728,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074754684&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.9b05728&partnerID=40&md5=9e94a9a37d6361ce6000e22fe51c96b2,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), P.O.

2-s2.0-85069047610,"An essential requirement for bio/chemical sensors and electronic nose systems is the ability to detect the intended target at room temperature with high selectivity. We report a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based gas sensor functionalized with a peptide receptor to detect dinitrotoluene (DNT), which is a byproduct of trinitrotoluene (TNT). We fabricated the multi-arrayed rGO sensor using spin coating and a standard microfabrication technique. Subsequently, the rGO was subjected to photolithography and an etching process, after which we prepared the DNT-specific binding peptide (DNT-bp, sequence: His-Pro-Asn-Phe-Se r-Lys-Tyr-IleLeu-HisGln-Arg-Cys) and DNT non-specific binding peptide (DNT-nbp, sequence: Thr-Ser-Met-Leu-Leu-Met-Ser-Pro-Lys-His-Gln-Ala-Cys). These two peptides were prepared to function as highly specific and highly non-specific (for the control experiment) peptide receptors, respectively. By detecting the differential signals between the DNT-bp and DNT-nbp functionalized rGO sensor, we demonstrated the ability of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) targets to bind to DNT-specific binding peptide surfaces, showing good sensitivity and selectivity. The advantage of using the differential signal is that it eliminates unwanted electrical noise and/or environmental effects. We achieved sensitivity of 27 ± 2 × 10−6 per part per billion (ppb) for the slope of resistance change versus DNT gas concentration of 80, 160, 240, 320, and 480 ppm, respectively. By sequentially flowing DNT vapor (320 ppb), acetone (100 ppm), toluene (1 ppm), and ethanol (100 ppm) onto the rGO sensors, the change in the signal of rGO in the presence of DNT gas is 6400 × 10−6 per ppb whereas the signals from the other gases show no changes, representing highly selective performance. Using this platform, we were also able to regenerate the surface by simply purging with N2. © 2019, The Author(s).","Lee K., Yoo Y.K., Chae M.-S., Hwang K.S., Lee J., Kim H., Hur D., Lee J.H.",57194947853;55375317600;55375458400;7402426589;57203144420;57206210471;7004373207;57976013900;,Highly selective reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sensor based on a peptide aptamer receptor for detecting explosives,2019,Scientific Reports,9,1,10297,,,NA,49,10.1038/s41598-019-45936-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069047610&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-45936-z&partnerID=40&md5=e5790b4ea3042e1031719f6eecd29576,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 02447, South Korea","Lee, K., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Yoo, Y.K., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Chae, M.-S., Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 02447, South Korea; Hwang, K.S., Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 02447, South Korea; Lee, J., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Kim, H., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Hur, D., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea; Lee, J.H., Department of Electrical Engineering, Kwangwoon University, 447-1 Wolgye, Nowon, Seoul  01897, South Korea",,,"Hur, D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, 447-1 Wolgye, South Korea; email: dhur@kw.ac.kr",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85078721294,"High volume screening of parcels with the aim to trace the illegal distribution and selling of fireworks using postal services is challenging. Inspection services have limited manpower and means to perform extensive visual inspection. In this study, the presence of solid pyrotechnic residues collected from cardboard shipping parcels containing fireworks was investigated for direct in-field chemical detection. Two emerging trace detection techniques, i.e., capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based inorganic oxidizer detector and infrared thermal desorption (IRTD) coupled with direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS), were investigated for their potential as screening tools. Detection of non-visible pyrotechnic trace residues from real-case seized parcels was demonstrated using both screening techniques. However, the high nitrate background in the commercial CE system complicated its screening for black powder traces. IRTD-DART-MS allowed differentiation between flash and black powder by identification of the molecular inorganic ions. Compared to the portable CE instrument, rapid screening using IRTD-DART-MS is currently limited to laboratory settings. The capabilities of these emerging techniques established solid particle and trace residue chemical detection as interesting options for parcel screening in a logistic setting. © 2020 The Authors","Bezemer K.D.B., Forbes T.P., Hulsbergen A.W.C., Verkouteren J., Krauss S.T., Koeberg M., Schoenmakers P.J., Gillen G., van Asten A.C.",56226487300;22955635800;57214448515;6603136518;56660392600;6602853554;35510357700;7005794346;56099430100;,Emerging techniques for the detection of pyrotechnic residues from seized postal packages containing fireworks,2020,Forensic Science International,308,,110160,,,NA,12,10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110160,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078721294&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2020.110160&partnerID=40&md5=cd6fb32104589aa36d01b029e141791a,"University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Science, Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Netherlands Forensic Institute, The Hague, Netherlands; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Materials Measurement Science Division, Gaithersburg, MD, United States; CLHC, Amsterdam Center for Forensic Science and Medicine, University of Amsterdam, P.O.

2-s2.0-85081944408,"Spin crossover complexes are known to undergo bond length, volume, and enthalpy changes during spin transition. In an explosive spin crossover complex, these changes could affect the mechanical and initiation sensitivity of the explosive and lead to the development of a new class of sensitivity switchable materials. To explore this relationship, the well-known spin crossover compound [Fe(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (1) was re-evaluated for its explosive properties, and its mechanical impact sensitivity was correlated to spin transition. A variable temperature impact test was developed and used to evaluate the impact sensitivity of 1 in the low spin (LS, S = 0), thermally accessed high spin (HS, S = 2), and mixed LS and HS states. For comparison, the structurally similar Ni compound, [Ni(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (2), which does not undergo a spin transition at accessible temperatures, was synthesized and characterized, and its explosive properties and variable temperature impact sensitivity measured. These results reveal a correlation between impact sensitivity and spin transition, where 1 exhibits lower impact sensitivity in the LS state and increases in sensitivity upon transition to the HS state. Density functional theory was used to predict structural changes that occur upon spin transition that correlate to the change in sensitivity. This demonstrates, for the first time, an explosive spin crossover compound (ExSCO) that exhibits switchable impact sensitivity with a fully reversible internal switching mechanism. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Nguyen T.-A.D., Veauthier J.M., Angles-Tamayo G.F., Chavez D.E., Lapsheva E., Myers T.W., Nelson T.R., Schelter E.J.",55473706400;6506619128;57215792135;7007028861;57205360637;41361637200;35885751100;7801405777;,Correlating Mechanical Sensitivity with Spin Transition in the Explosive Spin Crossover Complex [Fe(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2 n,2020,Journal of the American Chemical Society,142,10,,4842,4851,NA,32,10.1021/jacs.9b13835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081944408&doi=10.1021%2fjacs.9b13835&partnerID=40&md5=2499ecdf7cc3f28f0caa63b904e641d5,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Los Alamos National Laboratory, Chemistry Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Los Alamos National Laboratory, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States","Nguyen, T.-A.D., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Veauthier, J.M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Chemistry Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Angles-Tamayo, G.F., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Chavez, D.E., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Lapsheva, E., Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States; Myers, T.W., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Nelson, T.R., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Schelter, E.J., Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States",,Bond length; Density functional theory; Explosives; Initiators (explosives); Explosive properties; Impact sensitivities; Mechanical sensitivity; Spin-crossover complexes; Spin-crossover compounds; Switchable materials; Switching mechanism; Variable temperature; Nickel compounds; Article; chemical parameters; chemical structure; controlled study; decomposition; density functional theory; magnetism; phase transition; prediction; room temperature; spin crossover; spin transition; synthesis; thermostability,"Nguyen, T.-A.D.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States; email: tdnguyen@lanl.gov",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85078532235,"This paper presents E-Nose, a novel cost-effective, field-deployable portable system that constitutes a 4-channel signal conditioning circuit and multi-coated piezo-resistive micro-cantilever sensors for explosive sensing. E-Nose also features an embedded PCA and K-means based pattern recognition (PR) algorithm for the classification of explosives from non-explosives. The 4-channel configuration is a stack of two 2-channel circuits that are capable of measuring the change in the sensor resistance or capacitance in four optional modes of Δ {R} - Δ R, Δ {R} - Δ {C} , Δ C- Δ {R} , and Δ {C} - Δ {C} by using time multiplexing. The circuit uses a bidirectional AC current excitation method to drive the sensor bridge for significant reduction of DC offset errors, 1/f noise, line noise, and DC drifts. The proposed signal conditioning circuit uses the phase-sensitive synchronous rectification (PSSR) method for AC-to-DC conversion by using balanced demodulation. The circuit can measure a wide range of resistors that range from 100 Ω to 4 {M}Ω , with a sensitivity of 0.4mV/ppm and the worst relative error of 2.6%. The capacitive measurement range is from 100pF to 100 μ{F} with the worst relative error of 3.3%.

2-s2.0-85077162649,"Additive manufacturing is a promising approach to prepare highly specifically defined materials with unique dimensions, gradients in material attributes and on-demand properties. For energetic materials applications, it is particularly exciting for its potential to create lattice and cellular structures and gradient solids to focus or dissipate energy. However, there are significant challenges to overcome, particularly in obtaining the very high particle content (>80 vol % particles), while still being manufacturable. This work focuses on the polymer binder used in an energetic materials system and aims to understand how its characteristics affect the viscosity and printability of the suspension. Two different types of polymer binders are examined: (a) high molecular weight polymer in a solvent and (b) polymerizable smaller molecules that were cured via UV light. We show that the suspension viscosity is primarily controlled by the particle volume fraction for the UV curable binder, while both the particle volume fraction and polymer molecular weight influence the response in the case of the polymer/solvent binder. Both binder types can be tuned to provide printable suspensions that result in lines of consistent width and 3D disc-shaped objects, indicating that both paths are good potential directions for future formulations for polymer bonded explosives prepared via additive manufacturing. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ST-LIBS in tandem with the artificial neural network (ANN) is exploited for the first time towards the identification of explosives to the best of our knowledge. We use a single plano-convex lens in conjunction with a compact CCD spectrometer for analyzing the optical response. The experimental setup was initially optimized by interrogating metal target at a standoff distance of ∼ 6.5 m and later exploited for the study on a set of five explosives and nineteen non-explosives. This study reveals that good signal strength, even in a single-shot mode with a minimum pulse energy of 100 mJ can be easily achieved with the compact spectrometers available on catalogs of standard companies. A 2D scatter plot approach and principal component analysis (PCA) have demonstrated an excellent separation among the explosives as well as among explosives and non-explosives. The identification accuracies of ∼ 98 and 94 % were achieved within explosives and among explosives and non-explosives respectively with ANN.

The geometry optimization demonstrate the importance of van der Waals correction when studying the structure and properties of EIS, and highlights the significance of DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme in reproducing the experimental crystal structures of energetic salts. The IR spectrum of DA-DNBTO contains more number of intense peaks in the high frequency range (above 2850 cm−1) compared to DH-DNBTO. Especially, the electronic band gap of DNBTO salts obtained using the HSE06 hybrid functional are reduced to 50% when compared with that of BTO based energetic salts due to NO2 group attached to the DNBTO anion. Besides, we find that the O.O contacts that generally exist in most of the energetic materials do not show much impact in both the studied energetic salts. The strong intermolecular interactions of DA-DNBTO represents its inferiority in molecular stability, which is in good agreement with the experimentally measured impact sensitivity (>40 J) and friction sensitivity (360 N) values and also explains why it has highest stability compared to DH-DNBTO.

The fracture toughness values of HTPB propellant with mode I crack at different temperature and loading rate were obtained, and the effect of specimen thickness on the fracture toughness was investigated. The experimental results show that the fracture toughness value continuously increases with the decreasing of temperature and the increasing of loading rate, and a linear relationship exists between the fracture toughness and the logarithm of loading rate. The effect on the fracture toughness by the change in loading rate is more notable at a lower temperature. Both at 25 °C and −40 °C, the fracture toughness of thick specimens is higher than that of thin specimens, and at low temperature the change is more obvious.

2-s2.0-85079406671,"Working dogs are used for a range of important operational tasks. Identifying potentially successful working dogs as early as possible is important as rejection rates are high and training is costly. Earlier research has mainly concentrated on personality traits such as boldness, and there is only little knowledge on the possible association between cognitive traits and the actual working dog performance. This study investigated whether motor inhibition, persistence, problem-solving strategies, and spatial problem-solving are associated with explosive detection success in specially trained police dogs. Dogs (N = 24) were tested with a cognitive test battery, and subsequently they participated in an explosive detection test. The explosive searching situation and the location of the test was such that it would reflect as much as possible a real-life situation. Canine handlers also filled in a questionnaire regarding their dog's working behaviour. We found that those dogs that were more successful in explosive detection task had better motor inhibition in a cylinder task compared to dogs with lower success in an explosive search task. Furthermore, we found that dogs that made more errors in the cylinder task were generally more likely to give up searching sooner, as reported by their handlers, and also abandon sooner the problem-solving task in behavioural test. This study suggests that inhibitory control, specifically motor inhibition, may be an important aspect to consider when selecting suitable dogs for explosive detection tasks. Cylinder task is an easy and quick way to assess inhibitory control, although a larger dataset is needed to verify its association with working performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Tiira K., Tikkanen A., Vainio O.",6507108586;57216440685;36172641900;,Inhibitory control – Important trait for explosive detection performance in police dogs?,2020,Applied Animal Behaviour Science,224,,104942,,,NA,19,10.1016/j.applanim.2020.104942,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079406671&doi=10.1016%2fj.applanim.2020.104942&partnerID=40&md5=c0b3c4dc995efab37a72c588d5d0c561,"SmartDOG, Pietilänkatu 5, Riihimäki, 11130, Finland; Department of Equine and Small Animal Medicine, University of Helsinki, P.O.

2-s2.0-85078227974,"Safety, performance, cost efficient synthesis and toxicity are the most important aspects of modern explosives. Sensitivity measurements are performed in accordance with different protocols all around the world. Sometimes the BAM drop hammer does not accurately reflect the sensitivity of an energetic material, in particular the sensitivity of primary explosives. Therefore, we present here preliminary results obtained using the novel ball drop tester (BIT-132), manufactured by OZM research, following MIL-STD-1751 A (method 1016). The ball drop impact sensitivity tester is a device in which a free-falling steel ball is dropped onto an unconfined sample, and is expected to produce more realistic results than the currently commonly used BAM method. The results obtained using the probit analysis were compared to those from the BAM drop hammer and friction tester. The following sensitive explosives were investigated: HMTD, TATP, TAT, Tetrazene, MTX-1, KDNBF, KDNP, K2DNABT, Lead Styphnate Monohydrate, DBX-1, Nickel(II) Hydrazine Nitrate, Silver Acetylide, AgN3, Pb(N3)2 RD-1333, AgCNO, and Hg(CNO)2. © 2019 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85080881405,"Military-grade explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitroluene (TNT) are still a major worldwide concern in terms of terror threat and environmental impact. The most common methods currently employed for the detection of explosives involve colorimetric tests, which are known to be rapid and portable; however, they often display false positives and lack sensitivity. Other methods used include ion mobility mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which despite producing more reliable results often require large, expensive instrumentation and specially trained staff. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that utilizes the formation of a colored Janowsky complex with nitroaromatic explosives through reaction of the enolate ion of 3-mercapto-2-butanone. The colored complex is formed rapidly and can then be detected sensitively using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). We demonstrate that SERS can be used as a quick, sensitive, and selective technique for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexanitrostillbene (HNS), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl) with a detection limit of 6.81 ng mL-1 achieved for TNT, 17.2 ng mL-1 for tetryl, and 135.1 ng mL-1 for HNS. This method of detection also requires minimal sample preparation, can be done in a solution-based format, and utilizes the same precursor reagents for complex formation with each of the explosives which can then be identified due to the specificity of the unique SERS response obtained. We demonstrate the ability to simultaneously identify three explosive compounds within a total analysis time of 10 min. This method of detection shows promise for the development of rapid and portable SERS-based assays which can be utilized in the field in order to achieve reliable and quantitative detection.

2-s2.0-85073944272,"CL-20 among other nitramines is highly energetic along with the high positive heat of formation, and is a green energetic material employed as solid propellant [1–3]. However, it suffers basically from mechanical sensitivity and cost of synthesis. Cocrystallization of CL-20 with other suitable HEMs and LEMs is considered as the best crystal engineering technique to reduce its sensitivity [2, 4–6] as it masks crystal defects which in turn are responsible for mechanical sensitivity. The present investigation reports on the scale up process for the synthesis of Energy-Energy Cocrystallization (EECC) of ϵ-CL-20 and RDX and focus on the process to optimize the structure and energetics of thus formed cocrystal (CRCC) through DFT study. In our study CL-20 and RDX are taken in 1 : 1 molar ratio as suggested by Gui-yun Hang [7]. We claim successful scale up of cocrystallization to the earlier report [4] employing a more user friendly solvent (acetone) in the present study and the cocrystal formed was through ultra centrifugation. During the course of the cocrystal formation a phase transition from ϵ- to α took place. The Trauzl lead block tests on CRCC support the better performance of the synthesised EECC. Introducing shock tube test as the parameter to claim the strength of HEMs enhances the comparability [8]. The present report envisages and collaborates the synthesised CRCC through the theoretical study in arriving at the spatial conformation leading to optimization in structure and energy of the synthesized EECC. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The radar measurements are carried out in laboratory and field scenarios by using dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas and ultrawideband multiple-input-multiple-output GPR (MIMO-GPR) systems in the frequency range from 0.8 to 5 GHz. Recursive algorithms, recursive least square, and linear predictive coding are used for clutter removal. To extract targets features of polarimetric measurements, eight data-processing methods are assembled, combining clutter removal algorithms, time-frequency transformations, and singular value decomposition. Moreover, for every method, 13 target feature vectors are constructed. Each vector is used to train and test a support vector machine algorithm for the classification problem. Classification results are validated by using leave-two-out cross-validation.

2-s2.0-85070839470,"This work aims to develop a sensitive and easily applicable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)−based colorimetric sensor for determining the propellant ammonium perchlorate (AP) in the presence of other explosives and interferents. The sensor relied on attaching methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine dye with a planar structure, onto negatively charged AuNPs, and exploited the dye's electrostatic interactions with the large oxyanion, perchlorate. Ion-pair formation between MB@AuNP nanocomposite and AP led to nanoparticle aggregation, causing a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of AuNPs. This new peak emerged at around 650 nm, giving rise to the development of a ratiometric sensor by taking the ratio of 650 nm absorbance to that at 520 nm (pertaining to nanocomposite) and correlating this ratio to AP concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sensor for AP were 2.4 × 10−5 and 8.3 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively. The recovery of AP from ternary mixtures containing TNT and HMX was accomplished by water extraction using solubility differences. The interferences of common soil ions such as Cl−, NO3 −, NO2 −, SO4 2−, CH3COO−, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were investigated, and the assay was statistically compared (using t- and F- tests) against a reference method.

2-s2.0-85074874218,"Investigation of the detonation characteristics of an aluminized explosive added with boron (B) and magnesium hydride (MgH2) were undertaken and compared with the aluminized explosive of similar formulation. Firstly, the explosion heat was measured in a vacuumed calorimetric bomb, then the detonation pressure was determined by the interface velocity experiment, and finally the cylinder expansion test was performed. From the calorimetric data, the addition of B and MgH2 into an aluminized explosive increases the heat of explosion slightly. From the detonation pressure data, the addition of B and MgH2 appears to have no significant influence to the detonation pressure. From the cylinder test data, the detonation velocity, wall velocity, Gurney energy and detonation energy were determined. The aluminized explosive added with B and MgH2 shows weak acceleration ability, but exhibits a stronger afterburning potential. Finally the equation of state of the detonation products was determined for different casing conditions. Conclusions about how to use B and MgH2 in aluminized explosives to generate optimal effects are drawn. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85075376838,"Initial hot spot temperatures and temperature evolutions for 4 polymer-bound explosives under shock compression by laser-driven flyer plates at speeds from 1.5–4.5 km s−1 are presented. A new averaging routine allows for improved signal to noise in shock compressed impactor experiments and yields temperature dynamics which are more accurate than has been previously available. The PBX formulations studied here consist of either pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), or 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) in a 80/20 wt.% mixture with a silicone elastomer binder. The temperature dynamics demonstrate a unique shock strength dependence for each base explosive. The initial hot spot temperature and its evolution in time are shown to be indicative of chemistry occurring within the reaction zone of the four explosives. The number density of hot spots is qualitatively inferred from the spatially-averaged emissivity and appears to increase exponentially with shock strength. An increased emissivity for formulations consisting of TNT and TATB is consistent with carbon-rich explosives and in increased hot spot volume. Qualitative conclusions about sensitivity were drawn from the initial hot spot temperature and rate at which the number of hot spots appear to grow. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85076574161,"We present an approach and relevant models for predicting the probabilistic shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) behavior and Pop plot (PP) of heterogeneous energetic materials (HEM) via mesoscopic microstructure-explicit (ME) and void explicit (VE) simulations at the millimeter (mm) sample size scale. Although the framework here is general, the particular material considered in this paper is pressed Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3,5-tetrazocine (HMX). To systematically delineate the effects of material heterogeneities, four material cases are considered. These cases are homogeneous material, material with granular microstructure but no voids, homogeneous material with voids, and material with both granular microstructure and voids. Statistically equivalent microstructure sample sets (SEMSS) are generated and used. Eulerian hydrocode simulations explicitly resolve the material heterogeneities, voids, and the coupled mechanical-thermal-chemical processes. In particular, it is found that both microstructure and voids strongly influence the SDT behavior and PP. The effects of different combinations of microstructure heterogeneity and voids on the SDT process and PP are quantified and rank-ordered. The overall framework uses the Mie–Grüneisen equation of state and a history variable reactive burn model (HVRB). A novel probabilistic representation for quantifying the PP is developed, allowing the calculation of (1) the probability of observing SDT at a given combination of shock pressure and run distance, (2) the run-distance to detonation under a given combination of shock pressure and prescribed probability, and (3) the shock pressure required for achieving SDT at a given run distance with a prescribed probability. The results are in agreement with general trends in experimental data in the literature. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85073560480,"Nano-aluminum, as a potential replacement of micro-aluminum, has attracted significant research interests in energetic fields due to its high reactivity. However, the intrinsic high surface area of nanoparticles drives nano-aluminum encounter challenges in handling process and prone to large aggregation, significantly impeding the further application of nano-aluminum. In this work, nano-aluminum based microspheres incorporating hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) are directly fabricated by electrospray deposition. These as-prepared microspheres were in high monodispersity and their size ranges from 8 to 16 μm. The surface morphology of such microspheres was adjustable by using different polymers as binder. Thermal behavior results show that CL-20 has no appreciable effect on the reactivity of nano-aluminum while the fluoropolymer binder (F2314) facilitates the oxidation of nano-aluminum. Nevertheless, the presence of CL-20 can significantly enhance the reactivity of nano-aluminum in the combustion behavior tests, where electrosprayed microspheres exhibit outstanding performance in comparison to physical mixed sample, presenting a high pressurization rate, peak pressure and short burning time. These excellent properties are possibly attributed to their uniform microstructure. Therefore, the use of electrospray method can offer a promising strategy to fabricate the microstructure controllable microspheres. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Huang C., Yang Z., Li Y., Zheng B., Yan Q., Guan L., Luo G., Li S., Nie F.",57199003532;55507724500;55863990300;55461546200;57125375900;57207384820;23397001300;12141531700;7003754833;,Incorporation of high explosives into nano-aluminum based microspheres to improve reactivity,2020,Chemical Engineering Journal,383,,123110,,,NA,56,10.1016/j.cej.2019.123110,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073560480&doi=10.1016%2fj.cej.2019.123110&partnerID=40&md5=f6b2acaee6d90c4a7a068ad3f2419a69,"Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Science and Technology on Combustion, Internal Flow and Thermo­structure Laboratory, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China","Huang, C., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Yang, Z., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Li, Y., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Zheng, B., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Yan, Q., Science and Technology on Combustion, Internal Flow and Thermo­structure Laboratory, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China; Guan, L., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Luo, G., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Li, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Nie, F., Institute of Chemical Materials, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China",Energetic materials; High explosives; High reactivity; Microspheres; Nano-aluminum,Aluminum; Explosives; Microspheres; Microstructure; Morphology; Pressurization; Surface morphology; Electrospray deposition; Electrospray method; Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane; High explosives; High reactivity; Nanoaluminum; Pressurization rates; Uniform microstructure; Aluminum coatings,"Nie, F.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: niefude@caep.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85067650386,"To optimize the energy output and improve the energy utilization efficiency of an aluminized explosive, an explosion device was developed and used to investigate the detonation pressure and temperature of R1 (Al6) aluminum powder and the aluminum powder particle gradation of R2 (Al6+Al13), R3 (Al6+Al24) and R4 (Al6+Al flake) in a confined space. By using gas chromatography, quantitative analysis and calculations were carried out to analyze the gaseous detonation products. Finally, the reaction ratios of the aluminum powder and the explosion reaction equations were calculated. The results show that in a confined space, the quasi-static pressures and equilibrium temperature of the aluminum powder in air are higher than in vacuum. In vacuum, the quasi-static pressures and equilibrium temperatures of the samples in descending order are R1>R3>R4>R2 and R3>R4>R1>R2, respectively. In air, the quasi-static pressures and equilibrium temperatures of the samples in descending order are R1>R2>R4>R3 and R1>R4>R2>R3, respectively. R4 (Al6+Al flake) and R3 (Al6+Al24) have relatively higher temperatures after detonation, which shows that the particle gradation method can enhance the reaction energy output of aluminum during the initial reaction stage of the explosion and increase the reaction ratio by 10.6% and 8.0%, respectively. In air, the reaction ratio of Al6 aluminum powder can reach as high as 78.16%, and the reaction ratio is slightly reduced after particle gradation.

2-s2.0-85081539470,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has started to attract attention in vapor sensing; however, practical applications require shorter response time and better sensitivity. Herein, we report a facile multiscale SERS substrate for trace-level detection of vapors using a portable Raman spectrometer through the synergistic integration of biologically fabricated diatom photonic crystals and gold-silica core-shell nanoparticles. The multiscale substrate is composed of (1) a micrometer-scaled, 3-dimensional, diatom biosilica frustule enabling efficient vapor-substrate interaction for rapid sensing, (2) periodic pores, on the order of 100 nm, inducing plasmonic-photonic coupled resonances for enhanced SERS signals, (3) gold nanoparticle cores, with a diameter on the order of 10 nm, contributing plasmonic field enhancements, and (4) porous 1 nm thick silica core-shells enabling analyte vapor adsorption and concentration. The combination of the hierarchal, multiscale features results in a SERS substrate capable of rapid and sensitive detection of target vapors in air. The multiscale substrate's functionality is characterized using the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene, and the contribution from each scale is verified by using a stagnant vapor chamber. The sensor equilibrates in only 3 min, and detection is achieved down to 1 ppm. The sensor is then applied to the detection of explosive 2,4-dinitrotoluene vapor below 100 ppb in an airflow chamber to replicate practical detection conditions, achieving detection in under 3 min at room temperature and under 1 min when heated.

2-s2.0-85072250335,"Sorbent capture provides a process for collecting airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for analysis by thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). Under typical laboratory conditions, analytical standards are readily available and calibration of instrumentation is a routine process. In contrast, field-portable instruments are standardised using a representative curve prepared on a limited number of instruments and then applied to fielded units. The performance of field-portable TD-GC-MS systems when deployed to multiple remote sites was studied, and a large variability in sensitivity and performance was observed when using the manufacturer-prescribed methods for calibration of instruments and normalisation of the data. This variability was remedied by the implementation of a non-interfering calibration that is pre-incorporated onto the sorbent media. Use of an in-situ calibration curve constructed using stable isotope labelled standards provided robust quantification, accuracy of measurement and diagnostic capabilities for malfunctioning fielded equipment. Pre-incorporation of isotopic analogues onto thermal desorption tubes in advance of field distribution greatly improves the accuracy and reproducibility of analyses and demonstrates, for the first time, definitive quantification of target analytes using field-portable GC-MS in an operational theatre. © 2020 Journal Compilation CSIRO 2020 Open Access.","Qualley A., Hughes G.T., Rubenstein M.H.",15760644400;57193675809;57193669691;,Data quality improvement for field-portable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry through the use of isotopic analogues for in-situ calibration,2020,Environmental Chemistry,17,1,,28,38,NA,9,10.1071/EN19134,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072250335&doi=10.1071%2fEN19134&partnerID=40&md5=91904dfac97f70d81baaf91d5ebfe048,"UES, Inc., Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing/RHMO, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433, United States; United States Air Force 711th Wing-Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing/RHMO, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433, United States","Qualley, A., UES, Inc., Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing/RHMO, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433, United States; Hughes, G.T., UES, Inc., Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing/RHMO, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433, United States; Rubenstein, M.H., United States Air Force 711th Wing-Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing/RHMO, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433, United States",,data quality; gas chromatography; isotopic composition; laboratory method; mass spectrometry; stable isotope; volatile organic compound,"Qualley, A.; UES, 2510 Fifth Street, Area B, Building 840, United States; email: anthony.qualley.ctr@us.af.mil",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85074485493,"There has been a large increase in the number of papers published that are relevant to this review over this review period. The growth in popularity of LIBS is rapid, with applications being published for most sample types. This is undoubtedly because of its capability to analyse in situ on a production line (hence saving time and money) and its minimally destructive nature meaning that both forensic and cultural heritage samples may be analysed. It also has a standoff analysis capability meaning that hazardous materials, e.g. explosives or nuclear materials, may be analysed from a safe distance. The use of mathematical algorithms in conjunction with LIBS to enable improved accuracy has proved a popular area of research. This is especially true for ferrous and non-ferrous samples. Similarly, chemometric techniques have been used with LIBS to aid in the sorting of polymers and other materials. An increase in the number of papers in the subject area of alternative fuels was noted. This was at the expense of papers describing methods for the analysis of crude oils. For nanomaterials, previous years have seen a huge number of single particle and field flow fractionation characterisations. Although several such papers are still being published, the focus seems to be switching to applications of the nanoparticles and the mechanistic aspects of how they retain or bind with other analytes.

Using SECDI, enhancements in the IMS signal for TNT and 2,6-DNT vapors at trace concentrations are as much as 2–26 times that observed with CD or SESI alone.

2-s2.0-85071148297,"Nitrocellulose (NC) and nitroglycerin (NG) are conventional energetic ingredients of solid double-base gun propellants. NC and NG are aliphatic nitrate ester compounds that are manufactured by nitrating through immersion in acid. Solid propellants are used in a wide range of both civilian and military applications, for example, as gas generators in airbags, as fuels in rocket motors or to shoot projectiles in guns. In all illustrations, the function of solid propellant is to generate gas, which is then employed to do mechanical work. The maximum pressure and the projectile velocity are important parameters of the interior ballistic process. The goal of the interior ballistic design of the gun is to attain a higher muzzle velocity under the smaller maximum chamber pressure. The burning rate of the propellant directly affects the formation rate of burning gases, which affects the ballistic parameters, either by diminishing the ballistic effectiveness or raising the safety hazard to the operator during firing. Note that the effect of the change of burning rate is not always negative; the fact is that we could change/control the burning rate to get better ballistic performances, includin ballistic efficiency as well as launching safety. Nevertheless, nitrate ester propellants are subjected to physical and chemical degradation during storage and this can modify the burning rate. Here we describe the effect of aging on the burning rate of spherical double-base propellants both qualitatively and quantitatively. We experimented unaged propellant, and propellant that was artificially aged at 71°C and 80ºC. The durations of heating at 71ºC were 10, 20, 30, 37, 48 and 62.5 days, respectively. The durations of heating at 80ºC were 1.8, 3.63, 5.41, 7.22, 9.02 and 10.83 days, respectively. The burning rate of investigating propellant was obtained by using closed-vessel experiments. The results show that towards low pressures, the burning rate increased with aging. Towards high pressure, the burning rate decreased as a function of aging. The effect of aging was quantified by the determination of defined aging sensitivity coefficients. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Boulkadid M.K., Lefebvre M.H., Jeunieau L., Dejeaifve A.",57192698361;56680840600;56619457800;57192700222;,Burning rate of artificially aged solid double-base gun propellants,2020,Journal of Energetic Materials,38,1,,1,19,NA,24,10.1080/07370652.2019.1657204,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071148297&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1657204&partnerID=40&md5=918d961b9adf58276d9c299efae75e3a,"Laboratoire de Propulsion Énergétique, UER, Procédés Énergétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique Chahid Abderrahmane Taleb (EMP), Bordj El Bahri, Algiers, Algeria; Laboratory for Energetic Materials, Royal Military Academy, Bruxelles, Belgium; PB Clermont SA, Engis, Belgium","Boulkadid, M.K., Laboratoire de Propulsion Énergétique, UER, Procédés Énergétiques, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique Chahid Abderrahmane Taleb (EMP), Bordj El Bahri, Algiers, Algeria; Lefebvre, M.H., Laboratory for Energetic Materials, Royal Military Academy, Bruxelles, Belgium; Jeunieau, L., Laboratory for Energetic Materials, Royal Military Academy, Bruxelles, Belgium; Dejeaifve, A., PB Clermont SA, Engis, Belgium",aging; aging sensitivity coefficient`; Burning rate; closed vessel; double﻿-base propellant,,"Boulkadid, M.K.; Laboratoire de Propulsion Énergétique, BP 17 Bordj El-Bahri, Algeria; email: karim.boulkadid@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85076179536,"We present new capabilities for investigation of microstructure in energetic material response for both explicit large-scale and multiscale simulations. We demonstrate the computational capabilities by studying the effect of porosity on the reactive shock response of a coarse-grain (CG) model of the energetic material cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), the non-reactive equation of state for a porous representative volume element (RVE) of CG RDX, and utilization of available supercomputing resources for speculative sampling to accelerate hierarchical multiscale simulations. Small amounts of porosity (up to 4 %) are shown to have significant effect on the initiation of reactive CG RDX using large-scale reactive dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Non-reactive RVEs are shown to undergo a porosity-dependent pore collapse at hydrostatic conditions, and an existing automation framework is shown to be easily modified for the incorporation of microstructure while retaining reliable convergence properties. A novel predictive sampling method based on use of kernel density estimators is shown to effectively accelerate time-to-solution in a multiscale simulation, scaling with free CPU cores, while making no assumptions about the underlying physics for the data being analyzed.

The ratiometric method (IE/IM) offers a linear response as a function of the concentration of picric acid (PA, i.e. 2,4,6-trinitrophenol), which is used as a model example of the nitroaromatic compounds (NOCs). The detection range is observed to be 0.1–120 μM of PA (22.9 ppb–27.5 ppm). The bright emission of the stable probe excimer and monomer can be easily distinguished under UV lamp from the quenched solution with nitro-aromatic molecules that enables naked-eye detection of nitro-aromatic explosives. The fluorescent paper strips prepared by embedding the probes on the surface of the paper are used for fast, portable and selective detection of NOCs. Our optimized methods can easily detect and quantify NOCs down to 0.1 μM.

2-s2.0-85073803256,"For modern munitions, high energy explosives are expected to reduce vulnerability and improve safety. In this study, based on the formulation of PAX-11 (94 wt% HNIW, 2.4 wt% CAB, 3.6 wt% BDNPA/F), FOX-7 is used as a portion replacement for HNIW to decrease vulnerability. To further decrease mechanical sensitivities and prevent static electricity, 0.5 wt% graphite is added to the surface of PBXs. A series of HNIW/FOX-7 based polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) with different formulations are prepared and mechanical sensitivities, thermal stabilities, detonation velocities, and slow cook-offs are studied to evaluate the energy and hazard of these PBXs. Additionally, finite element numerical simulations are utilized to study the transient temperature distributions, ignition time and ignition locations of the PBX cylinders during slow cook-off. Based on the results of this study, we obtain a high energetic low vulnerable PBX formulation (54 wt% HNIW, 40 wt% FOX-7, 2.4 wt% CAB, 3.6 wt% BDNPA/F, 0.5 wt% additional graphite) that balances energy and vulnerability.

All derivatives were fully characterized by vibrational infrared spectroscopy (IR), multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), impact and friction-sensitivity test. Additionally, the structures of 4–8 and 10–13 were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and their crystal packing characteristics were thoroughly analyzed. Compound 2 not only enchanced physical properties of its ionic derivatives obviously, but also showed good detonation performance (D: 9075 m s−1) exceeding that of RDX, excellent insensitivity (IS > 80 J, FS > 360 N) comparable to that of TATB and superior thermal stability (331 °C) to that of HNS. Its ionic salts (compounds 4–14) also exhibit reasonable properties, such as good experimental densities (1.75–2.10 g cm−3), high thermal stability (174289 °C), good safety properties, excellent detionation performance (Dv: 7745–8952 m s−1, P: 23.830.6 GPa), suggesting this new pyrazol-triazole hybrid is beneficial for improving their physical performance.

2-s2.0-85078712655,"Background: Fifteen states, including West Virginia, have liberalized their laws concerning fireworks possession and sale. Effective June 1, 2016, House Bill 2852 enabled all Class C fireworks to be sold within the state. The effects of this policy on fireworks-related injuries requiring immediate medical care are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this policy may have affected the fireworks-related injury rate and/or injury severity. Methods: Data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients treated by West Virginia University Medicine between June 1, 2015-May 31, 2017. The pre and post law periods were defined as June 1, 2015-May 31, 2016 and June 1, 2016-May 31, 2017, respectively. Fireworks-related injuries were identified via International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification codes and by free text searches of the electronic medical records. The rate of injuries pre and post-legislation were compared by Exact Poisson Regression, while demographic characteristics and injury severity were compared via Fisher's Exact tests. Results: 56 individuals were treated for fireworks-related injuries during the study period. The majority of patients were over 25 years of age (64%) and male (77%). Most of the injuries occurred within 7 days of a celebrated U.S. holiday (64%), and 28% were severe in nature. Age, sex, and injury severity did not significantly differ pre and post law passage. The injury rate per 100,000 patients was 39% higher after the law was enacted (p = 0.3475; incidence rate ratio 1.39, 95% Confidence Interval 0.74, 2.68). Conclusion: The law increasing access to Class C fireworks may have affected the injury rate, but not injury severity among treated patients. Effective, evidence-based, public health interventions applicable to all age groups may be warranted particularly around national holidays. This study may inform other states looking to amend their legislation.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Rudisill T.M., Preamble K., Pilkerton C.",56149876300;57215141578;37031844400;,The liberalization of fireworks legislation and its effects on firework-related injuries in West Virginia,2020,BMC Public Health,20,1,137,,,NA,15,10.1186/s12889-020-8249-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078712655&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-020-8249-0&partnerID=40&md5=4bf41a0d3c31ee5d9a9c1641ebce37bf,"Department of Epidemiology, West Virginia University, School of Public Health, PO BOX 9190, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States; School of Public Health, West Virginia University, PO BOX 9190, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States; Department of Family Medicine, West Virginia University, PO BOX 9152, Morgantown, WV  2506, United States","Rudisill, T.M., Department of Epidemiology, West Virginia University, School of Public Health, PO BOX 9190, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States; Preamble, K., School of Public Health, West Virginia University, PO BOX 9190, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States; Pilkerton, C., Department of Family Medicine, West Virginia University, PO BOX 9152, Morgantown, WV  2506, United States",Epidemiology; Injuries; Legislation; Policy,"explosive; adolescent; adult; aged; blast injury; child; female; human; incidence; law; leisure; male; middle aged; politics; preschool child; West Virginia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blast Injuries; Child; Child, Preschool; Explosive Agents; Female; Holidays; Humans; Incidence; Legislation as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Politics; West Virginia; Young Adult","Rudisill, T.M.; Department of Epidemiology, PO BOX 9190, United States; email: trudisill@hsc.wvu.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The current study is concerned with finding a practical approach for computing the Gurney velocity of pure and mixed high explosives which will eventually help warhead designers to select the best explosive to fulfill the needs of a particular mission. Using multiple regression analysis technique, a four-variable model was derived and used thereafter to estimate the Gurney velocity of aluminized and non-aluminized explosive formulations. The results show that the new model is particularly accurate in predicting the Gurney velocity of combined effects explosives, which are relatively a new class of high blast, high metal acceleration capability explosive compositions. © 2019 The Author",Frem D.,56337805200;,Estimating the metal acceleration ability of high explosives,2020,Defence Technology,16,,,225,231,NA,15,10.1016/j.dt.2019.07.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068544236&doi=10.1016%2fj.dt.2019.07.002&partnerID=40&md5=cff9704e336dd421c52c7bf2691a596d,"Frem Co., Beirut, Lebanon","Frem, D., Frem Co., Beirut, Lebanon",Aluminized explosives; Combined effects explosives; Fragmentation warheads; Gurney velocity; High explosives,Conceptual design; Regression analysis; Rockets; Velocity; Acceleration capabilities; Aluminized explosives; Combined effect; Conceptual design stages; Explosive fragmentation; Fragmentation warheads; High explosives; Multiple regression analysis; Explosives,,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85076628267,"After World War II, conventional and chemical ammunition containing mainly secondary and primary explosives was dumped in the sea. Explosives have medium toxicity to aquatic organisms, earthworms and indigenous soil microorganisms. Therefore, environmental monitoring is required, especially for dumped munitions. The main aspect of this work was to analyse the samples of lumps and sediments taken from the Baltic seabed. These samples were potentially explosives. The main goal of the study was to identify the type and composition of studied materials. In order to determine the chemical composition of samples of explosives, we used as follows: GC–MS/MS, LC-HRMS and NMR. Additionally, to determine the energetic properties we performed microcalorimetric-thermogravimetric analysis. Based on the obtained results, the composition of this explosive was TNT (41%), RDX (53%), aluminium powder (5%), and degradation products (below 1%). The resulting composition indicates that the analysed material can be classified in the “torpex” family, widely used during World War II. Regarding the results of the microcalorimetric analysis, we can conclude that excavated fragments of explosives are in very good condition and they still can detonate after being initiated. Therefore, there is a threat that they could be used for criminal or terrorist purposes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Nawała J., Szala M., Dziedzic D., Gordon D., Dawidziuk B., Fabisiak J., Popiel S.",36621129400;8921001100;57220064159;57200045219;57200042752;16309594400;8594012100;,Analysis of samples of explosives excavated from the Baltic Sea floor,2020,Science of the Total Environment,708,,135198,,,NA,17,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135198,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076628267&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.135198&partnerID=40&md5=7cf2f399999d6dd867ca0aa91889dc28,"Military University of Technology, ul.

2-s2.0-85078807988,"In this paper, an ingenious strategy based on constructing energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs) with cesium salts for new green and practical pyrotechnic composition is described. In order to obtain a non-hygroscopic, chlorine-free formulation, a novel triazole nitrogen-rich energetic ligand, N-(5′-amino-1H,1′H-[3,3′-bi(1,2,4-triazol)]-5-yl)nitramine (HABTNA), was designed and synthesized, which exhibited some good properties such as insensitivity, high nitrogen content and energy, and excellent oxygen balance. More importantly, using this triazole ligand and cesium(i) salts, an energetic metal-organic framework (EMOF) structure as a pyrotechnic colorant was built by a simple and green aqueous solution crystallization method. The results of single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments indicated that this EMOF has a compact three-dimensional structure with high density. Physical and chemical property tests revealed that this Cs(i)-based MOF has excellent moisture resistance and thermal stability, while, at the same time, it was also proved to be a high-energy insensitive energetic material with energy up to the explosive level. By a systematic pyrotechnic performance experiment, a chlorine-free pyrotechnic formulation with this flammable EMOF as the main component was developed, which was the first orange-light-emitting pyrotechnic formulation with high color purity and intensity. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.","Wang T., Zhou J., Zhang Q., Zhang L., Zhu S., Li Y.",57211561892;57214455604;55992885100;55976310400;16320133400;56549059600;,"Novel 3D cesium(i)-based EMOFs of nitrogen-rich triazole derivatives as ""green"" orange-light pyrotechnics",2020,New Journal of Chemistry,44,4,,1278,1284,NA,30,10.1039/c9nj03577j,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078807988&doi=10.1039%2fc9nj03577j&partnerID=40&md5=e11528b8a4104fc60101f4fbee3357b1,"School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu Nanjing, 210094, China; Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan Mianyang, 621900, China","Wang, T., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu Nanjing, 210094, China, Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhou, J., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhang, Q., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhang, L., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu Nanjing, 210094, China; Zhu, S., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu Nanjing, 210094, China; Li, Y., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu Nanjing, 210094, China",,Cesium compounds; Chemical stability; Chlorine; Citrus fruits; Crystal structure; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Salts; Single crystals; Cesium salts; Energy; High nitrogen content; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nitramines; Non-hygroscopic; Property; Pyrotechnic compositions; Synthesised; Triazole derivatives; Ligands; cesium ion; metal organic framework; nitrogen; triazole derivative; Article; chemical bond; color; combustion; crystal; crystal structure; decomposition; green chemistry; high temperature; luminance; luminescence; moisture; priority journal; thermostability; X ray powder diffraction,"Zhang, Q.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: zhusg@mail.njust.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

A new efficient AIE luminogen, abbreviated as TPE-SFX, is designed and synthesized. It enjoys typical AIE features and high solid-state fluorescence quantum yield. It can be fabricated into fluorescent dots for explosive detection with good selectivity and rapid response. The fluorescence quenching process and mechanism are investigated. Taking advantage of its high solid-state fluorescence efficiency, TPE-SFX is further utilized on filter paper as solid-state sensor. Through analysis of grayscale variation of fluorescence images, a simple and reliable method is developed for quantitative analysis of picric acid (PA) with a low detection limit to 0.12 nmol/cm2. It is the first report of efficient luminogen utilized on filter paper for quantitative analysis of explosives with high sensitivity. Moreover, the fluorescent filter paper can be regenerated through an environmentally benign method simply by washing with water. In addition, the fluorescent filter paper enjoys good thermal stability, which can endure a high temperature up to 100 °C.

However, herein, we report the ability of a recently developed anthracene-based electron-rich π-conjugate as a small and suitable AIEgen for the selective and sensitive detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) through fluorescence (PL) quenching. This fluorophore consists of trimethoxybenzene-linked anthranyl-π-phenothiazine, which is recognized as a significantly electron-rich AIEgen suitable for the selective detection of TNT detection. The detection of TNT was performed in the solid, liquid and vapor states using this AIEgen in the aggregate or solid-state. The detection limit in the solution state was measured to be 3.2 × 10-9 M. When this fluorophore was impregnated on a paper strip for on-site visual detection, TNT was detected up to the 10-14 M level by the naked eye using a 365 nm UV-torch. The paper strip was also successfully used to detect TNT in the vapour state. This application was further extended to detect TNT in field soil. The detection of TNT by replacing trimethoxybenzene in the fluorophore with dimethoxy or monomethoxy was a failure, indicating the requirement of an adequate electron-rich system. Unlike the previous report with static quenching as the main reason for TNT detection, our experimental observations demonstrated the participation of favorable photo-induced electron transfer (PET) between TNT and the fluorophore as the origin of the PL quenching. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.","Prusti B., Chakravarty M.",57205326894;7003747050;,"An electron-rich small AIEgen as a solid platform for the selective and ultrasensitive on-site visual detection of TNT in the solid, solution and vapor states",2020,Analyst,145,5,,1687,1694,NA,40,10.1039/c9an02334h,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080864404&doi=10.1039%2fc9an02334h&partnerID=40&md5=5f97fc47e132e7708b3f58c4e0af30b9,"Department of Chemistry, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani-Hyderabad Campus, Jawahar nagar Shamirpet Mandal, Hyderabad Telangana, 500078, India","Prusti, B., Department of Chemistry, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani-Hyderabad Campus, Jawahar nagar Shamirpet Mandal, Hyderabad Telangana, 500078, India; Chakravarty, M., Department of Chemistry, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani-Hyderabad Campus, Jawahar nagar Shamirpet Mandal, Hyderabad Telangana, 500078, India",,Electrons; Explosives; Explosives detection; Quenching; Aggregation-induced emissions; Detection of explosives; Electron-rich; Picric acid; Polymeric molecules; Selective detection; Solid-solution state; Ultrasensitive; Vapor state; Visual detection; Fluorophores; explosive; fluorescent dye; picric acid; stilbene derivative; trinitrotoluene; chemistry; electron; genetic procedures; luminescence; procedures; soil; Biosensing Techniques; Electrons; Explosive Agents; Fluorescent Dyes; Luminescent Measurements; Picrates; Soil; Stilbenes; Trinitrotoluene,"Chakravarty, M.; Department of Chemistry, Jawahar nagar Shamirpet Mandal, India; email: manab@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85079123055,"The identification of confiscated commercial and military explosives is a crucial step not only in the uncovering of distribution pathways, but it also aids investigating officers in criminal casework. Even though commercial and military explosives mainly rely on a small number of high-energy compounds, a great variety of additives and synthesis by-products can be found that can differ depending on the brand, manufacturer and application. This makes the identification of commercial and military explosives based on their overall composition a promising approach that can be used to establish a pan-European Forensic Substance Database on Explosives. In this work, three analytical techniques were employed to analyze 36 samples of commercial and military explosives from Germany and Switzerland. An HPLC-HRMS method was developed, using 27 analytes of interest that encompass high-energy compounds, synthesis by-products and additives. HPLC-HRMS and XRD were used to gather and confirm molecular information on each sample and XRF analyses were carried out to gain insight on the elemental composition. Combining the results from all three techniques, 41 different additives could be identified as being diagnostic analytes and all samples showed a unique analytical fingerprint, which allows for a differentiation of the samples. Therefore, this work presents a set of methods that can be used as a foundation for the creation and population of a database on explosives that enables the assigning of specific formulations to certain brands, manufacturers and countries of origin. © 2020","Schachel T.D., Stork A., Schulte-Ladbeck R., Vielhaber T., Karst U.",57191499748;57214803038;7006022474;15764178400;7004395104;,"Identification and differentiation of commercial and military explosives via high performance liquid chromatography – high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF): Towards a forensic substance database on explosives",2020,Forensic Science International,308,,110180,,,NA,18,10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110180,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079123055&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2020.110180&partnerID=40&md5=99235106bdbb407ce2883c1a2a19c470,"Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 28/30, Münster, 48149, Germany; Kriminaltechnisches Institut, Bundeskriminalamt, Äppelallee 45, Wiesbaden, 65203, Germany","Schachel, T.D., Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 28/30, Münster, 48149, Germany, Kriminaltechnisches Institut, Bundeskriminalamt, Äppelallee 45, Wiesbaden, 65203, Germany; Stork, A., Kriminaltechnisches Institut, Bundeskriminalamt, Äppelallee 45, Wiesbaden, 65203, Germany; Schulte-Ladbeck, R., Kriminaltechnisches Institut, Bundeskriminalamt, Äppelallee 45, Wiesbaden, 65203, Germany; Vielhaber, T., Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 28/30, Münster, 48149, Germany; Karst, U., Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 28/30, Münster, 48149, Germany",Commercial explosives; Explosives; HPLC-HRMS; Military explosives; Powder XRD; XRF,explosive; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemical database; chemical fingerprinting; classification; controlled study; diagnostic test; Europe; forensic chemistry; Germany; intermethod comparison; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; priority journal; Switzerland; synthesis; ultra performance liquid chromatography; X ray; X ray diffractometry; X ray fluorescence spectrometry,"Karst, U.; Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Corrensstr. 28/30, Germany; email: uk@uni-muenster.de",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Moreover, the probe exhibits very high selectivity and low interference of other analogues nitro explosives toward the detection of TNP. The detection can be done in-field at any condition such as in the solution state, solid state, as well as vapor state with a paper strip device and can be observed by the naked eye, which is necessary for a real-time explosive detector without any sophisticated and expensive instruments with a quicker response time.

2-s2.0-85077121507,"In the development of crystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry, cocrystallization has been used as a way to develop novel explosives with tailored properties. We present a novel cocrystal solvate composed of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and aniline that exhibits unique physicochemical and explosive properties. X-ray diffraction studies reveal the crystallographic structure to contain TNT and aniline in a 1:1 molecular ratio. The crystals themselves exhibit a vibrant, ruby red color that likely results due to a charge-transfer interaction between the overlapping π-orbitals of the aromatic rings. The most notable evidence for a charge-transfer complex is the appearance of a broad absorbance peak in the visible region which is not present in the spectrum of either pure component. Comparisons of the cocrystal solvate to that of pure TNT are conducted to determine thermodynamic and kinetic parameters using both experimental and theoretical techniques. The desolvation of aniline from the cocrystal solvate was also investigated using both in situ powder X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy measurements to monitor changes in the crystal structure and surface topography, respectively. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Fondren N.S., Fondren Z.T., Unruh D.K., Maiti A., Cozzolino A., Lee Y.J., Hope-Weeks L., Weeks B.L.",57209745259;57210787887;13405067000;56270060800;8317019700;58707604700;35518176900;7005023958;,"Study of Physicochemical and Explosive Properties of a 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene/Aniline Cocrystal Solvate",2020,Crystal Growth and Design,20,1,,116,129,NA,10,10.1021/acs.cgd.9b00779,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077121507&doi=10.1021%2facs.cgd.9b00779&partnerID=40&md5=1ea9dd72c62978ce5419e04d63aaca16,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94551, United States","Fondren, N.S., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Fondren, Z.T., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Unruh, D.K., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Maiti, A., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94551, United States; Cozzolino, A., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Lee, Y.J., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Hope-Weeks, L., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Weeks, B.L., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States",,"Aniline; Atomic force microscopy; Charge transfer; Crystal atomic structure; Explosives; Supramolecular chemistry; Topography; X ray diffraction; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Charge transfer complex; Charge transfer interaction; Crystallographic structure; Explosive properties; Tailored properties; Theoretical technique; X-ray diffraction studies; Physicochemical properties","Weeks, B.L.; Texas Tech University, Box 43103, United States; email: brandon.weeks@ttu.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85076545562,"Dynamic damage response of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) based polymer bonded explosive (PBX) is investigated by using recently developed three dimensional Peridynamic (PD) method, allowing natural evolution of defects such as cracks or voids. An in-house PD codes are developed and verified by comparing with published results on Kalthoff-Winkler (KW) and crack branching benchmark tests. Numerical modeling of PBX is constructed via random micro-modulus approach, capable of capturing inherent microstructural heterogeneity of PBX materials. The simulation results indicate that damage process depends on both impact speed and interfacial property. Damage mode index (DMI), defined as the ratio of HMX-HMX damage to the summation of Binder-Binder and HMX-Binder damage, is proposed to quantify competitive damage mechanisms between trans- and inter-granular damage. The analyses of DMI exhibit that the inter-granular damage is dominant for the low adhesive strength of interface. However, the trend of trans-granular damage increases with increasing impact speed. The trans-granular damage mode becomes dominant for the high adhesive strength of interface. But the trend of inter-granular model increases with increasing impact speed. The current research highlight the competitive mechanisms of two typical damage modes as a function of material property and external loading conditions in a quantitative manner, providing additional insight into the damage mechanisms of PBX under impact loading. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deng X., Wang B.",14064337200;57213984557;,Peridynamic modeling of dynamic damage of polymer bonded explosive,2020,Computational Materials Science,173,,109405,,,NA,21,10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109405,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076545562&doi=10.1016%2fj.commatsci.2019.109405&partnerID=40&md5=bd2ef8553166ff644a7647969b603622,"National Key Laboratory of Shock Wave and Detonation Physics, Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China","Deng, X., National Key Laboratory of Shock Wave and Detonation Physics, Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Wang, B., National Key Laboratory of Shock Wave and Detonation Physics, Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China",Cracks; Dynamic damage; Impact loading; Peridynamic; Polymer bonded explosives,Adhesives; Benchmarking; Cracks; Dynamics; Polymers; Competitive mechanisms; Dynamic damage; Impact loadings; Interfacial property; Microstructural heterogeneity; Natural evolution; Peridynamics; Polymer bonded explosives; Explosives,"Deng, X.; National Key Laboratory of Shock Wave and Detonation Physics, China; email: xiaoliangdeng@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85076675243,"Laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) is a laboratory-scale method for assessing the microsecond and millisecond timescale performance of conventional military explosives. The technique has been combined with optical emission detection schemes to evaluate energy release during detonation and post-detonation timescales from the combustion of metal powders and mixtures of metal powders and explosives. Recently, Al/Zr reactive composite powders have been synthesized via high energy ball milling with the aim of decreasing ignition thresholds while simultaneously increasing overall combustion efficiency and burn time. Here, we utilize LASEM to evaluate micron-sized 3Al:2Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr fuel powders and compare their behavior to micron-sized Al powder, a commonly used explosive additive. We observed a rapid ignition of Al/Zr powders instead of the delayed ignition of the secondary deflagration cloud that is observed for pure Al. The composites also demonstrated longer burn times compared to Al particles of similar size. We also observed enhanced laser-induced shock velocities for the composite samples, implying increased energy release in the microsecond time regime compared to Al. In addition, we present LASEM data using Al/Zr mixed with trinitrotoluene (TNT), and associated CHEETAH calculations. As expected, adding pure Al to TNT lowers the laser-induced shock velocity, and we observe a further decrease of this velocity when using composite additives. The complex interplay of the metals with each other and the TNT reaction products is yet to be fully understood. © 2019","Wainwright E.R., Dean S.W., Vummidi Lakshman S., Weihs T.P., Gottfried J.L.",57196424617;26534252900;57204572872;7006098863;15070152000;,Evaluating compositional effects on the laser-induced combustion and shock velocities of Al/Zr-based composite fuels,2020,Combustion and Flame,213,,,357,368,NA,28,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.12.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076675243&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.12.009&partnerID=40&md5=1b34f6a42affd5b8fb41974fde475e19,"Materials Science & Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; U.S. Army Research Laboratory, FCDD-RLW-LB, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States; Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States","Wainwright, E.R., Materials Science & Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States, Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; Dean, S.W., U.S. Army Research Laboratory, FCDD-RLW-LB, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States; Vummidi Lakshman, S., Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; Weihs, T.P., Materials Science & Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States, Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; Gottfried, J.L., U.S. Army Research Laboratory, FCDD-RLW-LB, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States",Detonation velocity; LASEM; Metal combustion; Metallized explosives; Plasma; Reactive materials,Ball milling; Combustion knock; Detonation; Explosives detection; Fuel additives; Ignition; Laser produced plasmas; Metals; Plasmas; Velocity; Combustion efficiencies; Composite additives; Compositional effects; Detonation velocity; High-energy ball milling; LASEM; Metal combustion; Reactive materials; Powder metals; aluminum; explosive; fuel; trinitrotoluene; zirconium; Article; calculation; combustion; energy; powder; priority journal; velocity,"Wainwright, E.R.; Johns Hopkins University, Maryland Hall 3400N.

However, at present, the application of RDX has been encumbered by its high sensitivity and crystal defects. Herein, inspired by the unique structure and eco-friendliness of cellulose aerogel, for the first time, cellulose aerogel was introduced into RDX to prepare cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres by the solution impregnation method. The cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and a vertical impact sensitivity tester. The material detonation speed was calculated using EXPLO5. The results showed that the surface of cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres was smooth, and the internal three-dimensional cross-linked void of the cellulose aerogel spheres was well filled with RDX particles. Compared with RDX raw materials, the particle size of RDX in the cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres was greatly reduced. The N content in the cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres was as high as 32.24 %. Thermal analysis results showed that the activation energy of cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres increased by 31.28 KJ/mol. The crystal structure of RDX in the cellulose/RDX composite aerogel spheres remained unchanged.

We report herein, an improved method for synthesis of MTNI from 1-methyl-2,4-Dinitroimidazole (MDNI) under different nitration conditions in good yield. Heteropoly acid (HPA) is an efficient, mild and green catalysts used as nitric acid activator. The synthesized MTNI by this method was characterized by FT-IR, NMR & elemental analysis. Thermal behavior of MTNI was determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ignition temperature tester. Further, the effects of thermal energy on decomposition of formulations containing MTNI with solid high explosives such as RDX & CL-20 or polymeric binders like HTPB & GAP were investigated. Thermal decomposition mechanisms of MTNI and its precursor, MDNI based on Pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis were also described. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Anniyappan M., Vijay Varma K., Amit R.S., Nair J.K.",6506770567;57211457531;57211452784;35600606300;,"1-methyl-2,4,5-trinitroimidazole (MTNI), a melt-cast explosive: synthesis and studies on thermal behavior in presence of explosive ingredients",2020,Journal of Energetic Materials,38,1,,111,125,NA,23,10.1080/07370652.2019.1669735,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074032079&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1669735&partnerID=40&md5=1735b93ec7602083c39c833a699b645e,"High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), DRDO, Pune, India","Anniyappan, M., High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), DRDO, Pune, India; Vijay Varma, K., High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), DRDO, Pune, India; Amit, R.S., High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), DRDO, Pune, India; Nair, J.K., High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), DRDO, Pune, India",green synthesis; insensitive high energy material; MTNI; Nitroimidazole; thermolysis,,"Anniyappan, M.; High Energy Materials Research LaboratoryIndia; email: anniorganic@rediffmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85078750793,"An efficient hydrophobic condensation surface was developed and used as an ultrasensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor. The sensors were based on ZnO-Ag hybrid mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs) grafted on ordered Si micropillar arrays for detection of explosives. The hybrid SERS substrates were prepared via three steps: first, the ZnO seeds were precoated onto highly ordered Si micropillar arrays through atomic layer deposition; second, porous ZnO nanosheet arrays were grown based on ZnO seeds via chemical bath deposition by a secondary solvent addition method. Finally, ion-sputtering of Ag-nanoparticles (NPs) onto the ZnO MNSs was performed. Because the ordered Si micropillar arrays with a high aspect ratio provided 3D framework structures, the 3D ZnO MNSs of the Si pillar also generated three types of SERS active """"hot spots"""". And the excellent SERS effect induced by the three different """"hot spots"""" from 3D structures was further theoretically confirmed by simulating the electromagnetic field distributions. What's really interesting was that the prepared substrates showed superhydrophobicity. Based on the hydrophobic condensation strategy, hazardous explosives of NTO, FOX-7 were label-free detected in real samples like tap water and river water. And these samples, which were spiked with nitrophenylamine explosive TNT, were also selectively detected by secondary solvent addition under the 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP)-modified superhydrophobic surface. Because the electronic transfer compensation effect of the hybrids ensured the stability of substrates, ZnO-Ag MNS hybrid substrates could be used for ultrasensitive detection of explosives after being stored for 49 days. Therefore, these effective SERS substrates demonstrated a promising application in forensic science and homeland security. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","He X., Liu Y., Liu Y., Cui S., Liu W., Li Z.",55578863000;27171434100;57196314104;36069112500;56508579500;56055175100;,Controllable fabrication of Ag-NP-decorated porous ZnO nanosheet arrays with superhydrophobic properties for high performance SERS detection of explosives,2020,CrystEngComm,22,4,,776,785,NA,22,10.1039/c9ce01430f,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078750793&doi=10.1039%2fc9ce01430f&partnerID=40&md5=7d257371d052a0f754d42273abcf82d6,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Key Laboratory of Materials Physics, Anhui, Key Laboratory of Nanomaterials and Nanostructures, Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Centre for Advanced Inorganic Function Composites, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, China","He, X., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Liu, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Liu, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Cui, S., Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Centre for Advanced Inorganic Function Composites, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, China; Liu, W., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Li, Z., Key Laboratory of Materials Physics, Anhui, Key Laboratory of Nanomaterials and Nanostructures, Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China",,Aspect ratio; Atomic layer deposition; Condensation; Electromagnetic fields; Explosives; Explosives detection; Hydrophobicity; II-VI semiconductors; Nanosheets; Raman scattering; Silicon; Silver nanoparticles; Surface scattering; Zinc oxide; Chemical-bath deposition; Compensation effects; Detection of explosives; Electromagnetic field distribution; Framework structures; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Ultrasensitive detection; Substrates,"He, X.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: xuan.hellen@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

For this purpose, N and P co-doped carbon dots (NP-Cdots) have been used. Synthesis of N and P co-doped carbon dots has been carried out by a simple and quick method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was carried out to detect the doping of N and P. These carbon dots are insoluble in water (inNP-Cdots). These carbon dots were functionalized by treating them with conc. HNO3 so that they become water-soluble (wsNP-Cdots). These dots were characterized by different analytical techniques such as IR, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The as-prepared wsNP-Cdots have good fluorescence properties. The average diameter of wsNP-Cdots is found to be 5.7 nm with an interlayer spacing (d-spacing) of 0.16 nm. The as-prepared wsNP-Cdots are highly sensitive and selective toward TNP, as observed using a fluorescence quenching technique.

2-s2.0-85076991736,"Erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) was prepared independently by two research groups from the USA and the Netherlands. The partially nitrated impurities present in ETN were studied using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to address the ultimate challenge in forensic explosives investigations, i.e., providing chemical and tactical information on the production and origin of the explosive material found at a crime scene. Accurate quantification of the tri-nitrated byproduct erythritol trinitrate (ETriN) was achieved by in-lab production of an ETriN standard and using custom-made standards of the two isomers of ETriN (1,2,3-ETriN and 1,2,4-ETriN). Large differences in levels of ETriN were observed between the two sample sets showing that, even when similar synthesis routes are employed, batches from different production locations can contain different impurity profiles. In one of the sample sets the ratios of the lesser partially nitrated impurities, EDiN and EMN, in the ETN samples could be determined. The impurity profiles enable prediction of post-synthesis work-up steps by reduction of the level of partially nitrated products upon recrystallization. However, impurity analysis does not enable predictions with respect to raw material or synthesis route used. Nonetheless, characteristic impurity profiles obtained can be used in forensic casework to differentiate or link ETN samples. However, forensic interpretation can be complicated by acid catalyzed degradation which can cause changes in impurity levels over time. The high food-grade quality of the erythritol precursor materials did not provide other impurity markers using the LC-MS methods in this study. To expand our framework of chemical attribution a follow-up study will be reported that focuses on stable isotope analysis of ETN and its precursor materials that potentially allow predictions for forensic explosives intelligence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bezemer K., McLennan L., van Duin L., Kuijpers C.-J., Koeberg M., van den Elshout J., van der Heijden A., Busby T., Yevdokimov A., Schoenmakers P., Smith J., Oxley J., van Asten A.",56226487300;57188933115;57211084977;16637855600;6602853554;6506231904;7004857398;57212537510;56705308900;35510357700;7410170253;7004427947;56099430100;,Chemical attribution of the home-made explosive ETN – Part I: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of partially nitrated erythritol impurities,2020,Forensic Science International,307,,110102,,,NA,15,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.110102,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076991736&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2019.110102&partnerID=40&md5=c6a2fb6b800939e922dfc333e535a4e8,"Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, Amsterdam University of Amsterdam, Netherlands; Netherlands Forensic Institute, The Hague, Netherlands; University of Rhode Island, Department of Chemistry, KingstonRI, United States; Dept.

This study investigates the combustion properties of redox crystals comprising ammonium nitrate and simple saccharides, with the infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and molecular modelling. Furthermore, the thermogravimetric measurements afford the isoconversional analysis that yields the overall activation energies of the decomposition process. In addition, the synthesised samples are subjected to elemental and sorption analyses. The results outline (i) the molecular inclusion of the solid fuels within the lattice clusters of AN, (ii) a comparable hygroscopicity behaviour, i.e., a minor increase in affinity towards the absorption of moisture, and (iii) an energetically improved decomposition (and regression) rate, relatively to pristine AN. These features manifest themselves in lower activation energies of redox crystals that enhance the deflagrating properties of these materials for possible application in aviation propellants, and minimise the environmental footprint, especially the emission of nitrogen oxide to the atmosphere, which arises because of inhomogeneities in AN-fuel mixtures commonly used in civilian explosives. © 2019","Oluwoye I., Altarawneh M., Gore J., Dlugogorski B.Z.",56728921600;57205849510;56385013300;7006822192;,Burning properties of redox crystals of ammonium nitrate and saccharides,2020,Combustion and Flame,213,,,132,139,NA,13,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.11.030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076056982&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.11.030&partnerID=40&md5=791a4168e044f559603686c82bd52d92,"Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA  6150, Australia; Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, United Arab Emirates University, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed St, Al-Ain, 15551, United Arab Emirates; Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia; Office of Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation, Charles Darwin University, Ellengowan Drive, Darwin, NT  0909, Australia","Oluwoye, I., Discipline of Chemistry and Physics, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA  6150, Australia; Altarawneh, M., Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, United Arab Emirates University, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed St, Al-Ain, 15551, United Arab Emirates; Gore, J., Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia; Dlugogorski, B.Z., Office of Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation, Charles Darwin University, Ellengowan Drive, Darwin, NT  0909, Australia",Burning rate; Explosives; Kinetics; Monofuels; NOx; Pollution,Activation analysis; Activation energy; Enzyme kinetics; Fuels; Infrared spectroscopy; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Sugars; Thermogravimetric analysis; Burning rate; Combustion property; Decomposition process; Environmental footprints; Isoconversional analysis; Molecular inclusions; Monofuels; Thermogravimetric measurement; Explosives; ammonium nitrate; carbohydrate; carbon; nitrogen oxide; propellant; absorption; Article; atmospheric pressure; aviation; burn; chemical structure; combustion; crystal; decomposition; differential scanning calorimetry; infrared spectroscopy; moisture; molecular model; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; synthesis; thermogravimetry; wettability; X ray diffraction,"Dlugogorski, B.Z.; Office of Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Ellengowan Drive, Australia; email: bogdan.dlugogorski@cdu.edu.au",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Here, we report the development of a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based sensor system for highly sensitive detection of nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs). The sensor system is composed of a copolymer poly[(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-co-(Boc-Trp-EMA)] (RP) bearing tryptophan derivative in the side chain as donor and carbazole (CZ) as an acceptor. Primarily, the fluorescence of RP copolymer is quenched by non-radiative energy transfer to CZ which only happens once the two molecules are within Förster critical distance. The efficiency and rate of energy transfer process were calculated for this deliberated FRET system. This FRET pair exhibited a specific fluorescence response to NACs such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with 6.4, 5.9 and 1.4 μM limit of detections (LODs), respectively. Interestingly, the order of sensitivities of the FRET pair to NACs was very high.

2-s2.0-85071933475,"Propagation limits in gaseous detonation are an important problem in industrial chemical processes due to safety protections and precautions. Propagation limits are also of great significance for developing new-concept detonation engines. Due to the complex phenomena of near-limit detonation and the multiple competing mechanisms between the properties of mixtures and boundary conditions, development of a universal theoretical prediction model that can satisfactorily estimate the detonation velocity deficit (the difference between the actual detonation velocity and the theoretical CJ detonation velocity) near the limits is still extremely challenging. This work focuses on the essential relation between the detonation structure and prediction models. By analyzing the chemical length scales in the detonation structure of the ZND model, it is found that ΔI (induction length) and ΔR (exothermic length) are important length scales and that they are related to the reaction zone thickness (x) by: x = C·(ΔI + α·ΔR). In combination with Fay's boundary layer theory, a modified theoretical prediction model (MF) is proposed. The MF model is also compared with previous Fay models and experimental results. To verify the reliability of the MF model, three combustion mixtures (CH4-2O2, 2H2-O2 and C2H4-6N2O) and tubes with three different inner diameters (d = 36, 14 and 4 mm) are investigated. The results show that the MF model satisfactorily predicts the detonation deficit at the near-limit conditions.

2-s2.0-85069854941,"The terahertz (THz) spectrum is the focus of basic research in solid-state physics, chemistry, and materials science as well as applications in next-generation communications, far-infrared bolometer, bio/chemical-sensing, and medical imaging. This wavelength range is at the intersection between photonics and electronics, presenting tremendous opportunities to boost fundamental light–matter interactions enabled by plasmonic nanostructures, metamaterials, and inherent molecular vibrational modes, which occur on time scales of tens of femtoseconds to picoseconds. Recently, engineered metamaterials have presented unique platforms for sensing applications due to their ability to boost such light–matter interactions on the nanoscale and to their spectral selectivity in a wide range from the mid-infrared to the THz region. Their resonant response can be tuned to that of the intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes of target bio/chemical molecules. The emerging fields of highly sensitive and selective mid-infrared and THz spectroscopies based on metamaterials and plasmonic nanostructures are reviewed. Furthermore, practical applications of these next generation spectroscopic sensors are also discussed, where the sensor platforms will lead to a great impact in the advancement of ultrasmall-quantity detection of explosives, nondestructive inspection of hazardous materials, food safety, and conformational dynamics of biomolecules in their aqueous environment. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Using the hybrid target Si MSA substrate loaded/decorated with Ag–Au alloy NPs (obtained using femtosecond ablation in liquids) we demonstrate the trace level detection of organic nitro-explosives [picric acid (PA), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 1, 3, 5-trinitroperhydro-1, 3, 5-triazine (RDX)] and their mixtures. The microstructures/nanostructures of MSA fabricated at an input fluence of 9.55 J/cm2, and decorated with Ag–Au alloy NPs, exhibited exceptional SERS enhancement factors (EFs) up to ∼1010 for MB, ∼106 for PA, and ∼104 for RDX with the detection limits obtained being ∼5 pM, ∼36 nM, and ∼400 nM for MB, PA and RDX respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate these SERS substrates possess good reproducibility (RSD values < 15%) and a superior performance compared to a commercial Ag substrate (SERSitive, Poland). Three binary mixtures, i.e. MB-PA, MB-DNT, PA-DNT at different concentrations, were also investigated using the same SERS substrate to test the efficacy.

Nonetheless, their applications in aqueous media are limited largely due to their low stability against water molecules. This limitation has prompted researchers to develop water-stable MOFs (WMOFs) to overcome susceptibility to hydrolysis. As such, the efficacy of WMOFs has been exploited extensively for numerous sensing applications in aqueous and biological media with or without structural modifications (e.g., addition of chemical functionalities, development of thin films, or tuning of morphologies). This review highlights the topical developments in the application of WMOFs toward the sensing of various target species (e.g., metal ions, explosives, and antibiotics) in aqueous and biological media.

2-s2.0-85076507901,"The detection of nitroaromatic explosives is highly imperative for homeland security and environment protection. For in-field detection of explosives, the devices should be portable and inexpensive and, at the same time, offer fast response and high sensitivity. Optical waveguide sensor is one of the most promsing platforms to realize on-chip nitroaromatics detection due to their capability of large-scale integration, high sensitivity, and immunity to electronmagnetic interference. Meanwhile, polymeric waveguide materials are inexpensive and highly flexible for functionalization. In this study, we synthesize a functional polycarbonate with side-chain donor-π-acceptor dipolar chromophores, and design and fabricate an all-polymer waveguide sensor for the detection of nitrobenzene (NB) and 2, 4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) vapors. The waveguide sensor is based on an unbalanced Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with two different arms coated with the synthesized polycarbonate. The phase difference between the two arms of the MZI is modulated by the refractive-index change of the coating, which originates from the interaction between dipolar chromophores and electron-deficient NB or DNT vapor in polycarbonate. Our fabricated sensor can reversibly detect NB vapor up to its equilibrium concentration in air (∼300 ppm) with a maximum wavelength shift larger than 8 nm. It can irreversibly detect DNT at a much lower concentration (ppb level) with a maximum wavelength shift larger than 5 nm. The response time of the sensor is shorter than 100 s. Our all-polymer MZI, together with the new sensing material, provides a new approach for the realization of low-cost, high-performance explosive detection for in-field applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Jiang L., Wu J., Chen K., Zheng Y., Deng G., Zhang X., Li Z., Chiang K.S.",57209076639;55614302500;7410237622;57212382812;55343154500;57189600735;55707106100;16309003700;,Polymer waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer coated with dipolar polycarbonate for on-chip nitroaromatics detection,2020,"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical",305,,127406,,,NA,18,10.1016/j.snb.2019.127406,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076507901&doi=10.1016%2fj.snb.2019.127406&partnerID=40&md5=831faf10c6769f77172f9dde462e0446,"School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; College of Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Functional Molecules, Chengdu Normal University, Chengdu, China; Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Jiang, L., School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Wu, J., School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Chen, K., School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Zheng, Y., School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Deng, G., College of Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Functional Molecules, Chengdu Normal University, Chengdu, China; Zhang, X., College of Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Functional Molecules, Chengdu Normal University, Chengdu, China; Li, Z., College of Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Functional Molecules, Chengdu Normal University, Chengdu, China; Chiang, K.S., Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",Dipolar polycarbonate; Donor-π-Acceptor chromophores; Mach-Zehnder interferometer; Nitroaromatic explosive detection; Polymer waveguide sensors,Aromatic compounds; Chromophores; Explosives; Mach-Zehnder interferometers; Optical waveguides; Plastic coatings; Polycarbonates; Refractive index; Semiconductor quantum wells; Waveguide components; Dipolar chromophores; Environment protection; Equilibrium concentration; Nitroaromatic explosives; Optical waveguide sensors; Polymer waveguides; Refractive index changes; Zehnder interferometers; Explosives detection,"Wu, J.; School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, China; email: jieyunwu@uestc.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85069591787,"Due to the significance of explosive detection for homeland security and environmental protection, the research of new materials and new methodologies for sensing electron-deficient explosive nitryl aromatics is urgently imperative. In this paper we demonstrate an optofluidic laser sensor for explosive detection by using a highly electron-rich dye (dye-1) with donor-acceptor-donor conjugated structure. The design and facile synthesis process of dye-1 are described. Theoretical calculations, UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectra are investigated to understand the structure-property relations. Exceptionally high quantum yield of emission in solution is achieved. As a proof of concept, electron-deficient explosive molecule 2, 4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) is used as a model analyte to evaluate the performance of the optofluidic laser sensor. Experimental results indicate that the optofluidic dye laser sensor achieves a large dynamic range with 4 orders of magnitude and an ultralow limit of detection (10 nM), much better than fluorescent sensor.

2-s2.0-85069919794,"ZrAl3/Al composite fuels (Al-xZr, x=10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 53 wt.%) were prepared by the non-consumable arc-melting technique and close-coupled gas-atomization. In order to study the effects of the zirconium content and the oxygen partial pressure on the thermal properties of composite fuels, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, TG-DTA and DSC were used to characterize the composite fuels, respectively. The result shows that the addition of zirconium leads to the formation of a special structure inside the powder, promoting the oxidation of ZrAl3/Al composite fuels. Besides, non-selective oxidation of ZrAl3 played an important role in promoting the oxidation process. The oxygen bomb experiment was conducted to evaluate the combustion performance of ZrAl3/Al composite fuels. Oxygen bomb experiments show that the gravimetric combustion enthalpy of the composite fuels decreases linearly with the increase of zirconium content, and increases with the increase of oxygen partial pressure. However, the volumetric combustion enthalpy decreases first and then increases with the increase of zirconium content, and shows a general upward trend when the partial pressure of oxygen reaches 2.5 MPa or more. The pressure curve indicates that the Al-53Zr composite fuels have the maximum pressure propagation rate (dP/dt)max (which characterizes the maximum flame propagation rate and higher energy releasing rates) in the prepared series of composite fuels. The study demonstrates a complete combustion of ZrAl3/Al composite fuels under high pressure. ZrAl3/Al composite fuels could be considered as a very promising energetic additive in the field of new-energetic material. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85068789425,"Environmental and safety concerns have obliged efforts to detect nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), including the use of luminescent sensors. Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) has been generally accepted as the main sensing mechanism which would imply its use in highly selective sensors. However, the contribution of different mechanisms, such as the Inner Filter Effect (IFE), which can also play a very important role in these sensors, has been neglected. The proposal of this work is to provide a survey of some luminescent sensors, addressing their quenching mechanisms and the misconceptions related to them. In addition, these sensors were tested for forensic screening to see if they are suitable for primary detection of explosives in cases of suspicion of explosive handling. For this purpose, three luminescent sensors, which have been claimed to be selective and have PET, were tested and used as probes: amine capped CDot (1S), [Eu2(BDC)3(H2O)2]·(H2O)2 (2S), and [Tb(BTC)]n (3S). UV/vis and time-dependent measurements, as well as corrected Stern Volmer plots, were used to demonstrate that the PET is not the main quenching mechanism in the 1S. Besides, simple experiments (using a 1 mm cuvette and two cuvettes) proved that the IFE is the main mechanism responsible for quenches quenching the luminescence in all three sensors. Finally, the suitability of these sensors for use in a screening test to detect explosives was evaluated, where false positive results are not desirable. We observed that common products, such as cosmetics, may cause those false positives results. One interferer in particular reduced luminescence of all sensors by about 55%. Consequently, these systems cannot be considered suitable to be used as a screening test for explosive handling. © 2019","Mauricio F.G.M., Silva J.Y.R., Talhavini M., Júnior S.A., Weber I.T.",57193544455;57194281944;6602405849;35516899500;7102280478;,Luminescent sensors for nitroaromatic compound detection: Investigation of mechanism and evaluation of suitability of using in screening test in forensics,2019,Microchemical Journal,150,,104037,,,NA,17,10.1016/j.microc.2019.104037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068789425&doi=10.1016%2fj.microc.2019.104037&partnerID=40&md5=9dee40a4bc5038bb5ed209311928ed8d,"Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, 70910-000, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF, Brazil; Materials Science Program, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil; Fundamental Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil; National Institute of Criminalistics, Brazilian Federal Police, SAIS Quadra 07 Lote 23, Brasília, 70610-200, Brazil","Mauricio, F.G.M., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, 70910-000, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF, Brazil; Silva, J.Y.R., Materials Science Program, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil; Talhavini, M., National Institute of Criminalistics, Brazilian Federal Police, SAIS Quadra 07 Lote 23, Brasília, 70610-200, Brazil; Júnior, S.A., Materials Science Program, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil, Fundamental Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil; Weber, I.T., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, 70910-000, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF, Brazil, Materials Science Program, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil",Explosive screening test; Inner filter effect; Luminescent sensors; Nitroaromatic compounds; Photoinduced electron transfer,,"Weber, I.T.; LIMA, P.O.

Profound analyte oxidation was observed for particular compounds (TNT (9) and 2, 4-DNT (10)), whose mass spectra were completely dominated by the oxidation products when nitrogen was substituted for helium in DART analysis. This interesting phenomenon suggested that a highly oxidative environment provided by N2 DART ion source. A possible mechanism involved in nitrogen DART was proposed which may help further understanding the different chemistry involved in the ionization process. This work also presents a thermal desorption DART (TD-DART) configuration that can enable rapid, specific analysis of explosives from swipes. The screening of swipes with three different compositions (fiberglass, Hybond N+ membrane, and filter paper) showed that fiberglass swipe has the best performance which was then used for the subsequent TD-DART analysis. A direct comparison of TD-DART with traditional DART demonstrated that TD-DART indeed gives better response than traditional DART (provided that the distance between the DART source and mass spectrometer is the same) and will have wider applications than traditional DART.

Thirty-three of them—nitroimidazoles, nitrotriazoles, and nitropyrazoles—were investigated. Computed density functional theory molecular charge densities were partitioned employing the accurate distributed multipole analysis (DMA) method. Based on the magnitude of the DMA atom-centered electric multipoles (monopole, dipole, and quadrupole values), mathematical models were developed to compute the impact sensitivity of the explosives composed of these molecules. Charge localization and delocalization of the ring nitrogen atoms as well as charges of the atoms of the nitro group affect the sensitivity of explosives composed of nitroazole derivatives. The sensitivity is strongly dependent on the ring position of the nitrogen atoms and the bonding site of the substituent groups.

2-s2.0-85066783991,"The detection and analysis of explosives and explosive-related compounds is a heightened priority in recent years for homeland security and counter-terrorism applications. This study aimed to evaluate the use of a commercial Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) instrument for the analysis of explosive vapours, with the long-term goal of developing a portable instrument for passively detecting explosives in air samples. A simple method to collect explosive vapour residues was developed using a glass vial containing varying amounts of the target explosives (1 mg/mL). Standards were diluted to the desired concentration in 150 μL of acetone to facilitate the evaporation. The top of the vial was covered with a circular 0.5 cm diameter filter paper and exposed to a range of temperatures from 22 °C to 80 °C for 15 min. Following evaporation, the filter paper chads were folded and inserted into the LOC wells containing the separation buffer for the analysis, avoiding any further extraction step. After successfully separating and detecting eight explosives via liquid analysis, three explosives were chosen as targets for the vapour analysis experiments. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene (TNB), 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-Trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (Tetryl) were successfully separated, detected and identified following the vapour extraction of explosive standards onto filter paper chads. Limits of detection for the liquid analysis were demonstrated to be 2.32 ng for TNB, 2.35 ng for Tetryl, and 3.25 ng for TNT. The minimum detectable mass found for the vapour analysis was 6.03 for TNB, 9.99 ng for TNT, and 14.22 ng for Tetryl. The average recovery from the paper chads was 29% for Tetryl, 47% for TNB, and 75% for TNT (n = 4), comparable with findings from previous studies. Results show that a minimum temperature of 40 °C is necessary to vaporize the compounds using acetone, while the best results were achieved when heating the vial to 80 °C.

2-s2.0-85073210307,"We study the microscopic structure properties and early thermal decomposition of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX)/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) composites on the basis of density functional theory calculation and quantum-based molecular dynamics simulation. The results show that the HMX crystal surfaces are significantly stabilized by electrostatic adsorption between nitro-O and HTPB-H (both for alkyl and hydroxyl H). The corresponding electronic structure has an obvious modification, with some impurity states derived from HTPB in the forbidden band area. The initial reaction energy barrier may be reduced due to the extra active electron, but the earliest reaction sites of HMX thermal decomposition are not considerably changed. The thermal dissociation of HMX is mainly initiated with the breaking of the C-N bond, which is followed by NO2 elimination and alkyl dehydrogenation. After that, many HTPB-Hs are transferred to nitro-O to form water molecules, resulting in a delay of carbon and hydrogen oxidation of HMX.

Traditional methods for detecting IEDs, such as X-ray, have some drawbacks, so safe and efficient new detection techniques are highly desired. Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MITAI), being widely investigated for biomedical applications, is a promising candidate for detecting explosives embedded in high-water content materials due to its intrinsic advantages of nonionizing radiation, high contrast, and easy imaging procedure. Proof-of-concept demonstration is theoretically and experimentally carried out by successful detection of an explosive surrogate sample immersed in water. Good accordance between the experimental and simulation results validates the effectiveness of this approach.

The data demonstrated that the NTO-added formulation was found to be higher shock insensitive compared to the RDX-only formulation. However, ~5% decrease in VOD was observed on incorporation of NTO. Further, the sheet explosive formulations were found insensitive toward friction up to 360 N.

2-s2.0-85065530554,"Due to its relatively simple preparation and readily available precursors, determination of triacetone triperoxide (TATP)by portable devices has become important. In this work, two different titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs)–based colorimetric sensors based on complex formation on the solid surface were developed for determination of H2O2 and TATP. The first sensor, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)modified-TiO2NPs–based paper sensor (APTES@TiO2NPs), exploits peroxo-titanate binary complex formation between APTES@TiO2NPs and H2O2 on chromatographic paper. The second sensor, 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol-modified-TiO2NPs–based solid sensor (PAR@TiO2NPs), relies on the formation of a ternary complex between Ti(IV), PAR and H2O2. The developed sensors were also applied to TATP determination after acidic hydrolysis of samples to H2O2. The limits of detection (LODs)of APTES@TiO2NPs–based paper sensor were 3.14 × 10−4 and 5.13 × 10−4 mol L−1 for H2O2 and TATP, respectively, whereas the LODs of PAR@TiO2NPs solid sensor were 6.06 × 10−7 and 3.54 × 10−7 mol L−1 for H2O2 and TATP, respectively.

2-s2.0-85062920196,"Detection canines are a major source of protection against the powerful peroxide explosive hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), as well as other homemade explosives (HMEs). However, HMTD is an extremely unstable molecule, which makes it difficult to safely obtain and use for the purposes of canine training and testing. To address this challenge, several non-detonable canine training aids have been designed for canine training. Bulk HMTD has a complex headspace, as shown by previous studies. This makes it a difficult odor to mimic and, in turn, makes evaluations and comparison of such training aids essential. In this work, five non-detonable HMTD canine training aids that are either commercially available or under development were evaluated with the goal of determining which most accurately represents the headspace of bulk HMTD. Of the five training aids, two were observed to reasonably mimic HMTD. While the remaining three training aids contained similar headspace components as HMTD, they did not exhibit the complexity of the bulk compound headspace. While none of the tested training aids exactly mirrored the bulk HMTD samples, they may have use in maintenance training when no bulk material is available. © 2019","Simon A.G., DeGreeff L.E.",57193125827;36992911500;,Variation in the headspace of bulk hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD): Part II.

In this research, several types of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) were selected to study the effects of crystal quality and morphology on the mechanical performance of LLM-105 based PBXs. The surface bonding status of the LLM-105 crystal and molding powder was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle analysis, and the moldability was evaluated by determining the relative density of pressed cylinders of corresponding PBXs. Besides, static and dynamic mechanical properties were studied and compared, presenting the compressive, tensile and creep curves. For LLM-105 based PBXs, spherical morphology and rough surface could result improved mechanical strength and creep resistance, facilitating the structural and dimensional stability of charges.

We use quantum and classical thermostats in reactive MD simulations to characterize the effect of energy distribution on the initiation and decomposition of the explosive 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) under shock and thermal loading. Shock simulations using the multiscale shock technique (MSST) show that nuclear quantum effects not only increase the temperature rise during dynamical loading but also lower the shock temperature corresponding to the threshold for initiation of chemical reactions. The lower specific heat and presence of zero point energy contribute approximately equally to these effects. Thermal decomposition simulations show that nuclear quantum effects lower the activation barrier associated with reaction compared to classical simulations. Quite interestingly, comparing quantum and classical simulations as a function of average kinetic energy shows that classical baths result in faster kinetics as compared with quantum ones; we explore the molecular origins of this observation. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Hamilton B.W., Kroonblawd M.P., Islam M.M., Strachan A.",57204864211;56232556300;57212453332;57203050202;,"Sensitivity of the Shock Initiation Threshold of 1,3,5-Triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) to Nuclear Quantum Effects",2019,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,123,36,,21969,21981,NA,35,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05409,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072542153&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.9b05409&partnerID=40&md5=33cb91de63b557291f03bb35bdd4d81e,"School of Materials Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States","Hamilton, B.W., School of Materials Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States; Kroonblawd, M.P., Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Islam, M.M., School of Materials Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States; Strachan, A., School of Materials Engineering, Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States",,"Decomposition; Equations of motion; Initiators (explosives); Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Molecular dynamics; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; Specific heat; 1 , 3 , 5-triamino-2 , 4 , 6-trinitrobenzene; Activation barriers; Classical equation; Classical simulation; Energy distributions; Molecular dynamics simulations; Nuclear quantum effects; Zero-point energies; Nuclear reactions","Strachan, A.; School of Materials Engineering, United States; email: strachan@purdue.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85074136855,"We demonstrate an ultrafast laser-ablated hierarchically patterned silver nanoparticle/graphene oxide (AgNP/GO) hybrid surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for highly sensitive and reproducible detection of an explosive marker 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). A hierarchical laser-patterned silver sheet (Ag-S) is achieved by ultrafast laser ablation in air with pulse energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ. Multiple laser pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm and a pulse repetition rate of 50 fs at 1 kHz are directly focused on Ag-S to produce and deposit AgNPs onto Ag-S. The surface morphology of ablated Ag-S was evaluated using atomic force microscopy, optical profilometry, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A rapid increase in the ablation rate with increasing laser energy was observed. Selected area Raman mapping is performed to understand the intensity and size distribution of AgNPs on Ag-S. Further, GO was spin-coated onto the AgNPs produced by ultrafast ablation on Ag-S. The hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO hybrid structure was characterized using FESEM, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Further, hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO hybrid structures have been utilized as SERS-active substrates for the selective detection of 2,4-DNT, an explosive marker. The developed SERS-active sensor shows good stability and high sensitivity up to picomolar (pM) concentration range with a Raman intensity enhancement of ∼1010 for 2,4-DNT. The realized enhancement of SERS intensity is due to the cumulative effect of GO coated on Ag-S as a proactive layer and AgNPs produced by ultrafast ablation.

Small devices with 1.5 kg of explosive, initiated with a detonating cord have been studied. Seven different mixtures have been tested with two types of ammonium nitrate AN (technical and fertilizer) in different forms like prills or powder. In some cases, the ammonium nitrate has been mixed with fuel oil while in others, it has been mixed with aluminum. The TNT equivalent based on pressure, impulse, arrival time, positive phase duration and shock front velocity have been calculated and analysed for each mixture. Comparing the field test data obtained with respect to the representation of the UFC 3-340-02 values, it can be seen that the parameters measured are consistent. The IEDs with fertilizer ammonium nitrate do not detonate with the present charge conditions so the shockwave generated is only due to the detonating cord. When using the technical ammonium nitrate, ANFO can partially detonate and generate a potentially dangerous shockwave. Finally, the IED with AN and aluminum produces a TNT equivalent close to one when the technical AN is used. © 2019, DESIDOC.","Chiquito M., Castedo R., López L.M., Santos A.P., Mancilla J.M., Yenes J.I.",57204148245;55193783800;14421375100;56680547200;57214839768;56548887600;,Blast wave characteristics and tnt equivalent of improvised explosive device at small-scaled distances,2019,Defence Science Journal,69,4,,328,335,NA,14,10.14429/dsj.69.12637,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079289813&doi=10.14429%2fdsj.69.12637&partnerID=40&md5=cc35b2fea12423539d7002137b9544e0,"Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, CP 28003, Spain; Compliance and Facilitation Directorate, World Customs Organization, Rue du Marché, Brussels, - 30-B-1210, Belgium; Infrastructures Command Ministry of Defense, Madrid, CP 28071, Spain","Chiquito, M., Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, CP 28003, Spain; Castedo, R., Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, CP 28003, Spain; López, L.M., Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, CP 28003, Spain; Santos, A.P., Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, CP 28003, Spain; Mancilla, J.M., Compliance and Facilitation Directorate, World Customs Organization, Rue du Marché, Brussels, - 30-B-1210, Belgium; Yenes, J.I., Infrastructures Command Ministry of Defense, Madrid, CP 28071, Spain",Air blast tests; Ammonium Nitrate; Blast waves; TNT equivalent,Aluminum; Fertilizers; Mixtures; Nitrates; Air blast; Air blast test; Blast waves; Fuels oil; Improvised explosives devices; Property; Scaled distances; Small devices; TNT equivalent; Wave characteristics; Explosives,"López, L.M.; Universidad Politécnica de MadridSpain; email: lina.lopez@upm.es",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85063221515,"Since its discovery in 2012, multiple techniques to generate the CL-20/HMX cocrystal have been published. However, as yet no assessment or trial has been reported of crystallisation methods capable of producing the cocrystal in a size region and production scale suitable for its use in polymer bonded explosives (PBX). This paper provides insight into the selection of suitable crystallisation methods, solvent selection and process optimisation with a focus on the efficient production of high-quality cocrystals for use in PBX. Through extensive solvent screening, acetonitrile was identified as the best solvent for solution-based crystallisation, due to its capability to produce compact parallelepipedic crystals and its comparably wide cocrystal phase region. Crystallisation conducted at 60 °C was found to increase the conversion rate and the material efficiency compared to room temperature. By application of an advanced seeding procedure, high-quality cocrystals in the size region of 180–250 μm were produced in laboratory-scale antisolvent and cooling crystallisations. By pilot-plant-scale batch reaction cocrystallization, cocrystals with a volume-weighted mean diameter of 33 μm were produced in quantities of 250 g per day. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85076381467,"Fabrication of highly stable, reversible, and efficient portable sensors for the detection of explosives for safety and security is challenging due to the robustness of the currently available detection tools, limiting their mass deployment to the explosion prone areas. This paper reports a new direction towards the sensing of nitro- and peroxide-based explosives using highly stable rare-earth-doped BaWO4 nanofibers with remarkable sensitivity and reversibility. BaWO4 nanofibers doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions are fabricated through a sol-gel electrospinning process, and their emission characteristics and application as a fluorescent probe for the sensing of 2-nitrotoluene and H2O2, explosive taggants representing a broad class of explosives, are studied in detail. Scheelite structured BaWO4 nanofibers exhibit excellent luminescence characteristics, and the rare-earth ion doping in the polycrystalline BaWO4 nanofibers is tailored to achieve blue, green, red, and white light emissions. These nanofibers are extremely sensitive to 2-nitrotoluene and H2O2 with rapid response time, and sensitivity is observed within the range of 1-400 ppb and 1-10 ppm, towards 2-nitrotoluene and H2O2, respectively. The fluorescence quenching of BaWO4 nanofibers in the presence of 2-nitrotoluene and H2O2 is exponential with the quenching constants up to 1.73 × 106 and 2.73 × 104 L mol-1, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of most of the fluorescent probes based on metal-organic frameworks and conjugated organic materials. After exposing to 2-nitrotoluene, the luminescence of the nanofibers is retained completely upon heating at 120 °C for 10 min and the sensory response is retained as fresh nanofibers, and currently available fluorescent explosive sensors could not achieve such a recovery. The high sensitivity and selectivity of scalable rare-earth-doped BaWO4 nanofibers provide a new platform for the simultaneous detection of two classes of explosives.

The energy characteristic of CL-20/RDX-CMDB propellants had also been calculated theoretically based on the principle of minimum free energy. The energy property of propellants with CL-20 was found to be evidently enhanced in comparison to those propellants containing RDX. The findings on combustion properties revealed that the combustion properties of CL-20-CMDB propellants were contrary to the of RDX-CMDB propellants. With the mass fraction of CL-20 increasing in the propellants, the burning rates of propellants can be enhanced significantly, but the burning rates of propellants containing RDX decreased. Analysis of the combustion residues for CL-20/RDX-CMDB propellants revealed that the C, Cu and Pb elements aggregated on combustion surface, which may be useful for guiding the regulation of combustion performance of high-performance CMDB propellants containing CL-20. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

All the parameters in the model are determined directly by the parameters in the DZK model for each explosive component. Furthermore, for the multicomponent insensitive explosive PBXC10 (70% TATB, 25% HMX, and 5% Kel-F800 by weight) with different explosive particle sizes, both shock initiation experiments and corresponding numerical simulations are performed, and there is satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and the available experimental data. It is found that the pressure histories present as a shape of step increase during the whole shock initiation process, which is resulted mainly from the rapid chemical reaction rate just behind the precursory shock wave front. It is also found that the smaller the size of the explosive particulates, the faster the pressure grows on the precursory shock wave front, the shorter the run distance to detonation, and the higher the chemical reaction rate just behind the precursory shock wave front. © 2019","Bai Z., Duan Z., Wen L., Zhang Z., Ou Z., Huang F.",57192303325;22940147800;37055038800;56374562800;35766795500;7401516511;,Shock initiation of multi-component insensitive PBX explosives: Experiments and MC-DZK mesoscopic reaction rate model,2019,Journal of Hazardous Materials,369,,,62,69,NA,15,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.02.028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061447572&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.02.028&partnerID=40&md5=1b981e6dd349972952805f67e8d597cd,"The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Nuclear and Radiation Safety Center, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Beijing, 100082, China; Institute of Technical Physics, College of Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China","Bai, Z., The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Duan, Z., The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Wen, L., The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China, Nuclear and Radiation Safety Center, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Beijing, 100082, China; Zhang, Z., Institute of Technical Physics, College of Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China; Ou, Z., The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Huang, F., The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China",Multicomponent mesoscopic reaction rate model; Multicomponent PBXs; One-dimensional Lagrangian experimental system; Particle size; Shock initiation,Initiators (explosives); Particle size; Reaction rates; Shock waves; Superconducting materials; Wavefronts; Explosive components; Insensitive explosives; Lagrangian; Mesoscopics; Multicomponents; Polymer bonded explosives; Reaction rate model; Shock initiation; Explosives; explosive; polymer; chemical reaction; experimental study; explosive; numerical model; optimization; parameter estimation; particle size; polymer; reaction rate; simulation; Article; chemical reaction; combustion; gas; mathematical model; partial pressure; particle size; reaction analysis; shock wave; thermal conductivity,"Duan, Z.; The State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, China; email: duanzp@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85072146730,"A sensor for trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection was developed by using a combination of optical micro-ring technology and a receptor coating based on molecularly imprinted sol-gel layers. Two techniques for deposition of receptor layers were compared: Airbrush technology and electrospray ionization. A concentration of less than 5 ppb for TNT in the gas-phase, using electrospray deposition of the receptor layer, was detected. The cross-sensitivities to organic substances and further nitro-based explosives were compared. As a result, the sensitivity to TNT is about one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the explosives 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) or 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) and about four orders of magnitude higher than the organic substances phenol, ethanol, and acetone. The signal response of the sensor is fast, and the compact sensor design enables the deposition of different receptor layers on multiple optical micro-rings on one chip, which allows a more precise analysis and reduction of side effects and false alarms. © 2019 by the authors.

To rank the performance of those formulations they are compared with 15 reference compositions containing both standard high explosives such as octogen (HMX)(2), hexogen (RDX)(3), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)(4), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)(5) as well as insensitive high explosives such as 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazolone (NTO)(6), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB)(7), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7)(8) and N-Guanylurea dinitramide (FOX 12)(9). NGu based formulations are superior to those based on FOX-12 or TATB and are a close match with FOX-7 based explosives, the latter just having higher Gurney Energies (∼10%) and slightly higher detonation pressure (+2%). NGu based explosives even reach up to 78% of the detonation pressure, 82% Gurney energy and up to 95% of detonation velocity of HMX. LBD-NGu dissolves in many melt cast eutectics forming dense charges thereby eliminating the need for costly High Bulk Density NGu. Nitroguanidine based formulations are at the rock bottom of sensitiveness among all the above-mentioned explosives which contributes to the safety of these formulations.

Quantification of total heat released and heat flow with aging time was conducted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal activity monitoring (TAMIII) respectively. Modified DB formulation based on 20 wt % RDX demonstrated enhanced thermal stability in terms of controlled heat flow, and slow decomposition reactions at elevated temperature. This formulation demonstrated extended service life up to 56 years compared with reference formulation.

2-s2.0-85074164421,"A high-pressure neutron diffraction study was conducted on polycrystalline samples of the two known polymorphs of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene [monoclinic (m) and orthorhombic (o) TNT] under hydrostatic conditions. Isothermal equations of state were obtained for both polymorphic forms. Neither polymorph was observed to undergo a phase transition in the pressure region 0-5 GPa, with both polymorphs displaying smooth compression behavior across the pressure range. This differs somewhat from previous X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy investigations in which discontinuities were observed in the P-V curves and spectral changes were reported at â2 GPa. The high-pressure response of these materials is supported by dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations which, while overestimating the experimental bulk moduli, give excellent agreement with the observed smooth compression response of both phases.

2-s2.0-85076005543,"The assembly of π-electron-rich fluorescent monomers (4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetraaniline) (ETTA) and 9,10-anthracenedicarboxaldehyde was selected to build a new dual luminescent covalent organic framework (DL-COF) of high thermal and chemical stability by a simple Schiff-base reaction. The resultant crystalline framework contained tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units at the vertices and the classic anthracene units at the edges, linked via imine (-CN-) bonds in rhombic-shaped sheets, which offered high fluorescence and binding sites for molecular recognition, respectively. These synergistic functions of the framework units endow the unique platform for chemical sensing. Due to the synergistic action, the DL-COF exhibits the best nitro explosive detection of high sensitivity (Ksv ∼ 106 M-1, Kq ∼ 1015 M-1 s-1) and selectivity (at a ppb level) among previously reported COF- and MOF-based sensors under similar conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of anthracene-based COF for such an application. Particularly, the incorporation of an anthracene unit strategy into the COF framework not only increased the structural assortment but also led to the exceptional sensing capabilities towards nitro explosives. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Faheem M., Aziz S., Jing X., Ma T., Du J., Sun F., Tian Y., Zhu G.",57202237895;57545326900;26633791100;57205334888;55796368800;36855990600;57189637355;7402633400;,Dual luminescent covalent organic frameworks for nitro-explosive detection,2019,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,7,47,,27148,27155,NA,109,10.1039/c9ta09497k,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076005543&doi=10.1039%2fc9ta09497k&partnerID=40&md5=dee9763404138da9d9e158226a96cddd,"Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; School of Material Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China","Faheem, M., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; Aziz, S., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; Jing, X., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; Ma, T., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; Du, J., School of Material Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Sun, F., State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; Tian, Y., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China; Zhu, G., Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of the Ministry of Education, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China",,Anthracene; Binding sites; Chemical sensors; Chemical stability; Ethylene; Explosives; Fluorescence; Chemical sensing; Covalent organic frameworks; Electron-rich; Explosive Detection; High sensitivity; Schiff base reaction; Synergistic action; Tetraphenylethylene; Explosives detection,"Du, J.; School of Material Science and Engineering, China; email: junyi_du@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85067064355,"Current effort merging rational design of colorimetric sensor array with portable and easy-to-use hand-held readers delivers an effective and convenient method for on-site detection and discrimination of explosives. However, on the one hand, there are rare relevant reports; on the other hand, some limitations regarding direct sensing, color retention, and array extendibility still remain. Herein, urea-functionalized poly(ionic liquid) photonic spheres were employed to construct a brand-new colorimetric sensor array for directly identifying five nitroaromatic explosives with a smartphone. It is found that the strong hydrogen bonding between the urea motifs and the nitro groups offers the spheres high affinity for binding the targets, whereas the existence of other abundant intermolecular interactions in poly(ionic liquid) units renders one single sphere eligible for prominent cross-responses to a broad range of analytes. Besides, in our case, opal-like photonic crystal structures other than chemical dyes are used to fabricate a new style of colorimetric array. Such structural colors can be vivid and unchanged over a long period even in hazard environments.

2-s2.0-85063264113,"5,5′-Bitetrazole-1,1′-dioxydihydroxylamine salt (TKX-50), a high-energy energetic material, possesses good safety and energy properties. The energy characteristic data of TKX-50 are commonly generated via theoretical simulation and experimental measurements. Interestingly, the detonation velocity of TKX-50 is higher than HMX, but the specific kinetic energy of TKX-50 is the opposite. Thus, a systematic study on the decomposition mechanism of TKX-50 is important to establish the reasons for this variation in specific kinetic energy. Although the thermal decomposition mechanism of TKX-50 has been reported, the specific compositional changes of its gas products under different heating conditions remain unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism from the perspective of gas products. Herein, the gas products of TKX-50 and HMX in thermal decomposition and thermal explosion are investigated and compared. It was found that more TKX-50 is converted to ABTOX for further decomposition when the heating rate increases. ABTOX can decompose to C2N2, which is prone to polymerization, generating a solid residue under high temperature and pressure. Although polymerized C2N2 decomposes and burns during the explosion, it delays the time of TKX-50 reaching its maximum amount of outgassing, thereby affecting its specific kinetic energy. Furthermore, in the thermal explosion, compared with HMX, TKX-50 generates less H2 and CO. Since the combustion heat of hydrogen is much higher than that of carbon, the more hydrogen generated, the higher the detonation heat obtained. Therefore, TKX-50 has a lower detonation heat, which also affects its specific kinetic energy. © 2019 the Owner Societies.","Zhao C., Chi Y., Peng Q., Yang F., Zhou J., Wang X., Yu K., Fan G., Sun J.",15761458500;16063349600;36908356400;57193121086;57210433346;55165008500;55842305300;55568138300;55716316600;,A study on the comprehension of differences in specific kinetic energy of TKX-50 and HMX from the perspective of gas products,2019,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,21,12,,6600,6605,NA,23,10.1039/c8cp07487a,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063264113&doi=10.1039%2fc8cp07487a&partnerID=40&md5=895b58ff497b437ded8959a682e47197,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), P.

2-s2.0-85065578496,"It has been more than a decade since nano/micromachines (NMMs) have received the particular attention of scientists in different research fields. They are able to convert chemical energy into mechanical motion in their surrounding environment. Herein, a powerful, efficient and fast strategy of using nanosized reduced graphene oxide flake (n-rGO)-based self-propelled tubular micromachines for the removal of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) is described. This method relies on the integration of the rGO as a well-known adsorbent of aromatic compounds with chemically powered engines for the removal of explosive compounds such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Nanographene oxide reduced electrochemically inside the pores of the polycarbonate membrane to form an outer layer (n-rGO, adsorbent layer) of the micromachines. Subsequent electrodeposition of nickel (Ni, magnetic layer) and platinum (Pt, catalytic layer) resulted in the formation of n-rGO/Ni/Pt micromachines. Notably, the bubble-propelled micromachines were able to remove nitroaromatic compounds with high efficiency (∼90-92%) compared to the efficiency of magnetic-guided (22-42%) and static (2.5-7%) micromachines.

The regeneration is based on an electrochemical method in which electron injection into the machine causes the expulsion of contaminants from the outer layer of the micromachines within a few seconds.

2-s2.0-85065439264,"Polymer bonded explosives are designed to initiate under controlled conditions. However, accidental ignition leading to a deflagration, and even detonation, may occur during manufacturing, handling and transport. Understanding how ignition depends on microstructural features, such as cracks and voids in the particles, and on the adhesive and mechanical properties of the binder through predictive numerical simulations and modeling will help to improve safety. Finite element simulations and experiments of a single high energetic material particle embedded in polymer binders are performed to investigate the effect of the material properties of the binder and the particle surface properties, on damage and temperature at an impact velocity of 10 m/s. Particles with low and high quality surface properties, and two different binders are analyzed. The simulations with the lower stiffness binder do not show a significant increase in temperature after impact. A polymer with higher stiffness induces more particle damage under impact contributing to a larger temperature rise. Furthermore, high quality surface and higher adhesion strength induces larger stresses and increase the temperature rise. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dandekar A., Roberts Z.A., Paulson S., Chen W., Son S.F., Koslowski M.",57189218906;57191368590;57208651687;57202255782;7202529994;6601980512;,The effect of the particle surface and binder properties on the response of polymer bonded explosives at low impact velocities,2019,Computational Materials Science,166,,,170,178,NA,15,10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.04.033,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065439264&doi=10.1016%2fj.commatsci.2019.04.033&partnerID=40&md5=9f5b52935b4f07f85c57d8ce5d906768,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States; Maurice J.

2-s2.0-85068867293,"Contamination from various sources is a global environmental and health threat, with mining and military activities in particular having spread nitroaromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and its degradation products and by-products, to the soil. The investigation and monitoring of large contaminated areas requires new detection methods since the established ones are expensive and time-consuming. Hence, we established a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS) method using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene as the matrix substance and an internal standard for quantification. Analyzing standard substances, we found specific signals for radical and fragment ions of different nitrotoluenes and nitrobenzenes with good reproducibility and detection limits down to 0.25 ng/μL. The analysis of soil sample extracts from a former production site showed clear signals for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and the primary degradation products aminodinitrotoluenes. Furthermore, quantification gave results comparable to those obtained by conventional liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The MALDI-TOF MS method has a comparatively lower reproducibility, with relative standard deviations of 6% to 20% for multiple measurements of standard solutions and soil sample extracts. Nevertheless, a comparison of both methods revealed the advantages of MALDI-TOF MS analysis of explosive-contaminated areas with regard to costs, time, and handling. Finally, our MALDI-TOF MS method fulfills all the needs for high sample throughput and can therefore be a valuable screening tool for explosive-contaminated areas.

2-s2.0-85064672970,"This paper offers a new method for calculating the reaction rate based on the pore collapse “hot-spot” ignition mechanism in multi-component polymer bonded explosives (PBXs), and proposes a mesoscopic reaction rate model that allows us to predict the shock initiation and detonation behaviors of multi-component PBXs with any explosive component proportion and explosive particle size. The pressure-time histories in PBXC03 (87 % HMX, 7 % TATB, and 6 % Viton by weight) and PBXC10 (25 % HMX, 70 % TATB, and 5 % Kel-F800 by weight) are calculated by using the new mesoscopic reaction rate model, and the numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the shock initiation and detonation behaviors of PBXC03 with the dominant component of HMX is mainly controlled by the hot-spot ignition. The subsequent combustion reacts fast once the hot-spot is ignited and shows an accelerated reaction characteristic. While, with the dominant component of insensitive TATB, the critical initiation pressure of PBXC10 is high enough to make almost saturated reactive hot spots just behind the precursory shock-wave front, and the shock initiation behavior is basically determined by the combustion reaction, which is characterized by a stable reaction due to the slow combustion-wave velocity. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85064175538,"The ability to detect traces of highly energetic explosive materials sensitively, selectively, accurately, and rapidly could be of enormous benefit to civilian national security, military applications, and environmental monitoring. Unfortunately, the detection of explosives still poses a largely unmet arduous analytical problem, making their detection an issue of burning immediacy and a massive current challenge in terms of research and development. Although numerous explosive detection approaches have been developed, these methods are usually time-consuming, require bulky equipment, tedious sample preparation, a trained operator, cannot be miniaturized, and lack the ability to perform automated real-time high-throughput analysis, strongly handicapping their mass deployment. Here, we present the first demonstration of the """"direct"""" electrochemical approach for the sensitive, selective, and rapid vapor trace detection of TATP and HMTD, under ambient conditions, unaffected by the presence of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide species, down to concentrations lower than 10 ppb. The method is based on the use of Ag-nanoparticles-decorated carbon microfibers air-collecting electrodes (μCF), which allow for the selective direct detection of the organic peroxide explosives, through opening multiple redox routes, not existent in the undecorated carbon electrodes.

2-s2.0-85062883474,"Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) usually detects different types of compounds by changing the discharge gas to produce different reagent ions in the ion source. In the present work, a novel method of changing reagent ions, ammonia-assisted PTR-MS, was developed. Through an injection port bypass, ammonia was injected into a homemade PTR-MS device. A conventional PTR-MS apparatus with reagent ions H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0, 1, 2) can be converted to an ammonia-assisted PTR-MS with reagent ions NH4+.The new method was introduced to detect triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosive material. Results showed that the sensitivity is enhanced more than 37 times compared with TATP detection using conventional PTR-MS and the limit of detection (LOD) could reach 1.3 ppb. TATP in real complex matrixes can also be detected successfully using this method. Compared to conventional PTR-MS, ammonia-assisted PTR-MS has better sensitivity and better LOD for TATP detection, and the technique provides common users with a convenient and quick method to change reagent ions.

2-s2.0-85073724223,"Photolysis is one of the main transformation pathways for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) released into the environment. Upon exposure to sunlight, TNT is known to undergo both oxidation and reduction reactions with release of nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ions, followed by condensation reactions of the oxidation and reduction products. In this study, compound classes of transformation products from the aqueous and solid phase photodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have been identified by liquid and solid state 13C and 15N NMR. Aqueous phase experiments were performed on saturated solutions of T15NT in deionized water, natural pond water (pH = 8.3, DOC = 3.0 mg/L), pH 8.0 buffer solution, and in the presence of Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM; pH = 3.7), using a Pyrex-filtered medium pressure mercury lamp. Natural sunlight irradiations were performed on TNT in the solid phase and dissolved in the pond water. In deionized water, carboxylic acid, aldehyde, aromatic amine, primary amide, azoxy, nitrosophenol, and azo compounds were formed. 15N NMR spectra exhibited major peaks centered at 128 to 138 ppm, which are in the range of phenylhydroxylamine and secondary amide nitrogens. The secondary amides are proposed to represent benzanilides, which would arise from photochemical rearrangement of nitrones formed from the condensation of benzaldehyde and phenylhydroxylamine derivatives of TNT. The same compound classes were formed from sunlight irradiation of TNT in the solid phase. Whereas carboxylic acids, aldehydes, aromatic amines, phenylhydroxylamines, and amides were also formed from irradiation of TNT in pond water and in pH 8 buffer solution, azoxy and azo compound formation was inhibited.

2-s2.0-85072064961,"In Thailand, most of the bomb devices produced by the terrorists use trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the main explosive material. Detecting TNT and preventing detonation could save many civilians. Due to its low vapor pressure, TNT requires an extremely high sensitivity method for detection. In this paper, we propose an application of the polyacrylamide gel as an electrochemical gas sensor for explosive material detection. Cyclic voltammetry signals were collected from samples, including TNT, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and non-explosive vapors. It was found that a time-derivative calculation of the signal was unique to each chemical, rather than the signal itself, demonstrating utility for the detection of explosive material.

2-s2.0-85065711797,"Identification and trace quantification of multiple explosives residues, their precursors and transformation products in complex samples remains very challenging. For solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry-based methods (LC-HRMS), interferences from co-extracted matrix components can significantly affect recovery during extraction and/or detector signal. The aim of this work was to develop a new, improved and more generalisable extraction approach to trace explosives analysis in a range of matrices using dual-sorbent SPE with LC-HRMS. Recoveries of 44 organic explosives from model solutions were optimised and compared for seven different sorbents (Oasis HLB, HyperSep Retain PEP and Isolute ENV+, HyperSep SAX, HyperSep NH2, Strata Alumina-N and Bond Elut CN). On average, Oasis HLB and Isolute ENV+ yielded the best recoveries (>80%). For three sorbents, mean recoveries remained ≤1%, which made them potentially suitable for matrix removal when used in series with more analyte-selective sorbents. To evaluate matrix effects, a range of aqueous (river- and wastewater), solid (soil), dirty (road sign swabs), oily (oven hood swabs) and biological (dried blood) samples were selected based on complexity and forensic relevance. With the exception of river water, matrix effects were lowest using dual-sorbent SPE, with little/no compromise in recovery. Quantitative method performance assessment is presented for 14 selected explosives, representative of different classes, molecular weights and volatilities, and across three different matrices (i.e. untreated wastewater, cooking oil residues and dried blood). Limits of detection improved by ∼10-fold over a single sorbent approach, enabling low fg sensitivity in many cases. Finally, application of the method to untreated wastewater enabled detection of new explosives traces for the first time, which could be used to help identify clandestine manufacture or sources of environmental toxicity. This approach offered a versatile solution to sample preparation for robust and highly sensitive detection/quantification of large numbers of explosives residues in a range of complex sample types. © 2019 The Authors","Irlam R.C., Parkin M.C., Brabazon D.P., Beardah M.S., O'Donnell M., Barron L.P.",57193189344;7005104365;55882869400;6506163935;57208755025;58862392600;,Improved determination of femtogram-level organic explosives in multiple matrices using dual-sorbent solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry,2019,Talanta,203,,,65,76,NA,24,10.1016/j.talanta.2019.05.047,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065711797&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2019.05.047&partnerID=40&md5=9dfc4221c634feaca29bc9e429760fda,"King's Forensics, School of Population Health & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Eurofins Forensic Services, Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Advanced Processing Technology Research Centre, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland; Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom","Irlam, R.C., King's Forensics, School of Population Health & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Parkin, M.C., King's Forensics, School of Population Health & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom, Eurofins Forensic Services, Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Brabazon, D.P., Advanced Processing Technology Research Centre, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland; Beardah, M.S., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom; O'Donnell, M., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Dstl, Fort Halstead, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom; Barron, L.P., King's Forensics, School of Population Health & Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom",Complex matrices; Explosives; High resolution accurate mass spectrometry; Sample preparation; Solid phase extraction,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Blood; Explosives; Explosives detection; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Oils and fats; Phase separation; Recovery; Sorbents; Sorption; Complex matrices; Environmental toxicity; High resolution; Highly sensitive detections; Performance assessment; Sample preparation; Solid-phase extraction; Transformation products; Extraction,"Barron, L.P.; King's Forensics, 150 Stamford Street, United Kingdom; email: leon.barron@kcl.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Binding studies are performed using experimental and computation techniques to quantify key binding parameters for the first time. This supramolecular complexation allows DNT to be positioned in close proximity to the plasmonic hotspots within aggregates of CB[7] and gold nanoparticles, resulting in significant SERS signals with a detection limit of ∼1 μM. The supramolecular ensemble is selective against a structurally similar nitroaromatics owing to the molecular-recognition nature of the complexation as well as tolerant against the presence of model organic contaminants that bind strongly to the SERS substrates. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chio W.-I.K., Peveler W.J., Assaf K.I., Moorthy S., Nau W.M., Parkin I.P., Olivo M., Lee T.-C.",57201698169;55659162000;57209503843;56459762000;7005107758;56217400400;7004016594;35119311000;,Selective Detection of Nitroexplosives Using Molecular Recognition within Self-Assembled Plasmonic Nanojunctions,2019,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,123,25,,15769,15776,NA,31,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b02363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065759896&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.9b02363&partnerID=40&md5=8da2dbf5b7979d70a71407edab88ea5a,"Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom; Singapore Bioimaging Consortium (SBIC), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A STAR), Singapore, 138667, Singapore; School of Chemistry, Joseph Black Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom; Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany; Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom","Chio, W.-I.K., Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom, Singapore Bioimaging Consortium (SBIC), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A STAR), Singapore, 138667, Singapore; Peveler, W.J., School of Chemistry, Joseph Black Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom; Assaf, K.I., Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany; Moorthy, S., Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom; Nau, W.M., Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany; Parkin, I.P., Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom; Olivo, M., Singapore Bioimaging Consortium (SBIC), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A STAR), Singapore, 138667, Singapore; Lee, T.-C., Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom, Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL), London, WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom",,Gold nanoparticles; Molecular recognition; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Raman spectroscopy; Self assembly; Substrates; Computation techniques; Host-guest complexations; Macrocyclic molecules; Organic contaminant; Selective detection; Supramolecular complexation; Supramolecular ensembles; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Complexation,"Lee, T.-C.; Department of Chemistry, United Kingdom; email: tungchun.lee@ucl.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85072686993,"Additive manufacturing (AM) represents one of the nine pillars of the new industrial revolution. Owing to the enthusiastic utilization of this technology by the wider professional and amateur communities, AM is becoming a driving force in the manufacturing sector due to its fast expansion and the availability of cheap and robust 3D printers. The 3D printing, especially the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method, has previously been utilized to fabricate carbon/polylactic acid (PLA) electrodes for electrochemical setups. Such electrodes require activation from their pristine state for improved conductivity, so far achieved by chemical treatment. Herein, a new simple physical thermal annealing method to activate graphene-based PLA electrodes is presented. The graphene/PLA electrodes are fabricated via FDM 3D printing using a commercial graphene-polymer composite conductive filament and subjected to thermal and chemical activation with a subsequent electrochemical pre-treatment. The thermally annealed electrodes exhibit faster electron transfer than the chemically activated or non-treated electrodes in the inner sphere redox probe ferro/ferricyanide. The thermally activated graphene/PLA electrodes are also successfully employed as a low-cost alternative to nitroaromatic explosive sensors. This chemical-free activation method is a facile, fast, and simple route to activate conductive carbon/PLA 3D prints, which increases the electric conductivity and preserves the fine details of the printed objects, making this activation method relevant to a broad range of applied fields utilizing conductive polymer composites. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Novotný F., Urbanová V., Plutnar J., Pumera M.",56404653800;22982446100;6504816138;16246120900;,Preserving Fine Structure Details and Dramatically Enhancing Electron Transfer Rates in Graphene 3D-Printed Electrodes via Thermal Annealing: Toward Nitroaromatic Explosives Sensing,2019,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,11,38,,35371,35375,NA,84,10.1021/acsami.9b06683,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072686993&doi=10.1021%2facsami.9b06683&partnerID=40&md5=d55d9d54bb90b164fce44903725b3060,"Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Technická 5, Prague, CZ-166 28, Czech Republic; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea; Future Energy and Innovation Laboratory, Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Purkyňova 656/123, Brno, CZ-616 00, Czech Republic","Novotný, F., Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Technická 5, Prague, CZ-166 28, Czech Republic; Urbanová, V., Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Technická 5, Prague, CZ-166 28, Czech Republic; Plutnar, J., Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Technická 5, Prague, CZ-166 28, Czech Republic; Pumera, M., Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Technická 5, Prague, CZ-166 28, Czech Republic, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea, Future Energy and Innovation Laboratory, Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Purkyňova 656/123, Brno, CZ-616 00, Czech Republic",3D printing; additive manufacturing; electrochemical sensor; explosives detection; fused deposition modeling,3D printers; Additives; Annealing; Aromatic compounds; Chemical activation; Composite materials; Conducting polymers; Deposition; Electrochemical sensors; Electron transitions; Explosives; Explosives detection; Fused Deposition Modeling; Graphene; Layered manufacturing; Reactor cores; 3-D printing; Conductive polymer composites; Electron transfer rates; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Graphene-polymer composites; Industrial revolutions; Manufacturing sector; Nitroaromatic explosives; Electrochemical electrodes,"Pumera, M.; Center for Advanced Functional Nanorobots, Technická 5, Czech Republic; email: pumera.research@gmail.com",Review,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85066995852,"Between 1920 and 1967, approximatively 8200 tons of ammunition waste were dumped into some Swiss lakes. This study is part of the extensive historical and technical investigations performed since 1995 by Swiss authorities to provide a risk assessment. It aims to assess whether explosive monitoring by passive sampling is feasible in lake-bottom waters. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and Chemcatcher were first calibrated in a channel system supplied with continuously refreshed lake water spiked with two nitroamines (HMX and RDX), one nitrate ester (PETN), and six nitroaromatics (including TNT). Exposure parameters were kept as close as possible to the ones expected at the bottom of two affected lakes. Sixteen POCIS and Chemcatcher were simultaneously deployed in the channel system and removed in duplicates at 8 different intervals over 21 days. Sorbents and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes were separately extracted and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. When possible, a three-compartment model was used to describe the uptake of compounds from water, over the PES membrane into the sorbent. Uptake of target compounds by sorbents was shown not to approach equilibrium during 21 days. However, nitroaromatics strongly accumulated in PES, thus delaying the transfer of these compounds to sorbents (lag-phase up to 9 days). Whereas sampling rate (RS) of nitroamines were in the range of 0.06–0.14 L day−1, RS of nitroaromatics were up to 10 times lower. As nitroaromatic accumulation in PES was integrative over 21 days, PES was used as receiving phase for these compounds. The samplers were then deployed at lake bottoms. To ensure that exposure conditions were similar between calibration and field experiments, low-density polyethylene strips spiked with performance reference compounds were co-deployed in both experiments and dissipation data were compared. Integrative concentrations of explosives measured in the lakes confirmed results obtained by previous studies based on grab sampling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; POCIS and Chemcatcher are appropriate to monitor HMX, RDX and PETN in lake-bottom water but require using PES membrane as receiving phase to monitor TNT and other nitroaromatic explosives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Estoppey N., Mathieu J., Gascon Diez E., Sapin E., Delémont O., Esseiva P., de Alencastro L.F., Coudret S., Folly P.",56394590600;24450444000;55892615300;53164605900;16052038000;8660271000;6603316631;57209257163;8579191900;,Monitoring of explosive residues in lake-bottom water using Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) and chemcatcher: determination of transfer kinetics through Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane is crucial,2019,Environmental Pollution,252,,,767,776,NA,23,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.087,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066995852&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2019.04.087&partnerID=40&md5=34889a38ea07f0b8428407ae1eba87f3,"Federal office for defence procurement (armasuisse), Feuerwerkerstrasse 39, Thun, 3602, Switzerland; School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Direction générale de la santé, Secteur des produits chimiques, République et Canton de Genève, Switzerland; Central Environmental Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Station 2, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland","Estoppey, N., Federal office for defence procurement (armasuisse), Feuerwerkerstrasse 39, Thun, 3602, Switzerland, School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Mathieu, J., Federal office for defence procurement (armasuisse), Feuerwerkerstrasse 39, Thun, 3602, Switzerland; Gascon Diez, E., School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland, Direction générale de la santé, Secteur des produits chimiques, République et Canton de Genève, Switzerland; Sapin, E., School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Delémont, O., School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Esseiva, P., School of Criminal Justice, University of Lausanne, Batochime building, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; de Alencastro, L.F., Central Environmental Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Station 2, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Coudret, S., Central Environmental Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Station 2, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland; Folly, P., Federal office for defence procurement (armasuisse), Feuerwerkerstrasse 39, Thun, 3602, Switzerland",Continuous flow calibration; HMX; Passive sampling; RDX; Three-compartment model; TNT,"Aromatic compounds; Calibration; HMX; Industrial chemicals; Lakes; Organic chemicals; Risk assessment; Silicon compounds; Sorbents; Compartment model; Continuous flows; Exposure conditions; Nitroaromatic explosives; Passive sampling; Performance reference compounds; Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS); Polyethersulfone membrane; Explosives; aromatic nitro compound; lake water; polyethersulfone; polyethylene; sorbent; azocine derivative; cyclonite; explosive; octogen; organic compound; polyethersulfone; polymer; sulfone; triazine derivative; trinitrotoluene; water; bottom water; concentration (composition); explosive; kinetics; lake water; membrane; sampling; water pollution; accuracy; Article; calibration; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; equilibrium constant; hydrophobicity; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; particle size; pH measurement; residue analysis; salinity; temperature sensitivity; transport kinetics; water analysis; water flow; chemistry; environmental monitoring; kinetics; lake; liquid chromatography; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; water pollutant; Switzerland; Azocines; Calibration; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Monitoring; Explosive Agents; Kinetics; Lakes; Organic Chemicals; Polymers; Sulfones; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Triazines; Trinitrotoluene; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Estoppey, N.; School of Criminal Justice, Batochime building, Switzerland; email: nicolas.estoppey@unil.ch",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85066845229,"Explosives are of significant interest to homeland security departments and forensic investigations. Fast, sensitive and selective detection of these chemicals is of great concern for security purposes as well as for triage and decontamination in contaminated areas. To this end, selective sorbents with fast binding kinetics and high binding capacity, either in combination with a sensor transducer or a sampling/sample-preparation method, are required. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) show promise as cost-effective and rugged artificial selective sorbents, which have a wide variety of applications. This manuscript reviews the innovative strategies developed in 57 manuscripts (published from 2006 to 2019) to use MIP materials for explosives. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no commercially available MIP-modified sensors or sample preparation methods for explosives in the market. We believe that this review provides information to give insight into the future prospects and potential commercialization of such materials.

2-s2.0-85072927163,"Here, we describe an innovative Integrated Laser Sensor (ILS) that combines four spectroscopic techniques and two vision systems into a unique, transportable device. The instrument performs Raman and Laser‐Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy excited at 355 nm and Laser‐Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) excited at 1064 nm, and it also detects Laser Scattering (LS) from the target under illumination at 650 nm. The combination of these techniques supplies information about: material change from one scanning point to another, the presence of surface contaminants, and the molecular and elemental composition of top target layers. Switching between the spectroscopic techniques and the laser wavelengths is fully automatic. The instrument is equipped with an autofocus, and it performs scanning with a chosen grid density over an interactively selected target area. Alternative to the spectroscopic measurements, it is possible to switch the instrument to a high magnification target viewing. The working distances tested until now are between 8.5 and 30 m. The instrument is self powered and remotely controlled via wireless communication. The ILS has been fully developed at ENEA for security applications, and it was successfully tested in two outdoor campaigns where an automatic recognition of areas containing explosives in traces had been implemented. The strategies for the identification of nitro‐compounds placed on various substrates as fingerprints and the results obtained at a working distance of 10 m are discussed in the following. © 2019 by the authors.

Artificial neural networks, one of the most promising methods of Data Science, has been used for predicting detonation velocity based on a trained set comprising of a large data set containing 104 data points extracted from over 65 explosive compounds and compositions with diverse characteristics and properties. The utility of the method has been demonstrated through validation for over 37 explosive compounds again with diverse characteristics constituting to a data set of 74 data points. The usefulness and versatility of the method is clear as it exhibits similar predictive accuracy on comparison with the similar data derived from two other well-known empirical models.

2-s2.0-85062995689,"                             Gas phase detection of explosives is an ongoing trend in the detection sciences. The conception of gas phase detection devices requires knowledge about gas phase concentration of the target analytes. Nitrate esters are well performing explosives with a high potential for misuse in improvised explosive devices that need to be detected at vulnerable infrastructures. With respect to this the six nitrate esters, ethyl nitrate (1), ethylene glycol dinitrate (2), glycerol trinitrate (3), meso-erythritol tetranitrate (4), d-mannitol hexanitrate (5) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (6) were investigated in terms of detectability by vacuum outlet-GC/MS as potential components in improvised explosive devices. All compounds besides 5 could be detected using vacuum outlet GC/MS and their limits of detection were determined according to DIN 32645 : 2008. The vapor pressure of 2–4 was measured using the transpiration method. It was observed that the introduction of a CHONO                             2                              unit lowers the vapor pressure of the nitrate esters by about two orders of magnitude.

2-s2.0-85064163624,"                             In recent years, cocrystallization has emerged as an effective way of tuning the properties of compounds and has been widely used in the field of energetic materials. In this study, we have prepared two novel cocrystals of CL-20 and methylimidazole, including a 1:2 CL-20 / 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (1) and a 1:4 CL-20 / 4-methyl-5-nitroimidazole (2). Cocrystal 1 has good physical and detonation properties (ρ                             1                              = 1.652 g·cm                             –3                             , D                             1                              = 7073 m·s                             –1                             , P                             1                              = 21.6 GPa); however, cocrystal 2 shows higher properties (ρ                             2                              = 1.680 g·cm                             –3                             , D                             2                              = 7945 m·s                             –1                             , P                             2                              = 27.4 GPa). The performance of both cocrystals is better than those of TNT. Thermal performance suggests that both the cocrystals have moderate thermal stabilities. Cocrystal 1 decomposes at 164.9 °C and cocrystal 2 has an exothermic peak at 221 °C. Both cocrystals are insensitive energetic explosives (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N). Methylimidazole compounds are rarely used as coformers to form cocrystals with CL-20, which possess good properties for a range of potential applications.

A movable device has been designed for detection of explosive embedded in a concrete wall by using TNM technique. The experimental set-up was modeled and optimized with the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code. The γ-ray energy spectrum of graphite sample was firstly collected to calibrate the detection system and verify the validity of the MCNP5 model. Then γ-ray energy spectra of different samples under different situation are accumulated and compared with the simulation results. The samples of TNT and ammonium nitrate surrogate were placed behind a concrete wall with thickness of 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm, respectively.

2-s2.0-85066232669,"The concept of TNT equivalence is often invoked to predict the blast parameters generated from explosions, in which high explosives other than Trinitrotoluene (TNT)are used. This paper discusses the TNT equivalence concept for bare charges using Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). At first, a review of different methods to derive TNT equivalence factors is given. After that, numerical simulations are conducted in order to obtain overpressure and impulse data, which is fitted by using the curve-fitting method. Meanwhile, the equations representing the fitted curves of peak overpressures and maximum impulses are employed to calculate the TNT equivalence factors for overpressure and impulse, respectively. Fitting these data, formulae are developed to calculate the TNT equivalence factors of PETN for overpressure and impulse. It is found that a single value, i.e. 1.258 for overpressure and 1.272 for impulse, can be used to convert the charge mass of PETN to TNT in the far field. This statement is confirmed by a series of free field air blast measurements. However, the TNT equivalence factors of PETN vary significantly in the near field. The value can be as large as 2.6 times the one in the far field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Xiao W., Andrae M., Gebbeken N.",57195836010;57195836704;6701597363;,Air blast TNT equivalence factors of high explosive material PETN for bare charges,2019,Journal of Hazardous Materials,377,,,152,162,NA,24,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.05.078,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066232669&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.05.078&partnerID=40&md5=0f0d99d470c5417afe5673ed6dde7900,"University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Institute of Engineering Mechanics and Structural Analysis, RISK Research Center, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Neubiberg, 85577, Germany","Xiao, W., University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Institute of Engineering Mechanics and Structural Analysis, RISK Research Center, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Neubiberg, 85577, Germany; Andrae, M., University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Institute of Engineering Mechanics and Structural Analysis, RISK Research Center, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Neubiberg, 85577, Germany; Gebbeken, N., University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Institute of Engineering Mechanics and Structural Analysis, RISK Research Center, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Neubiberg, 85577, Germany",Maximum impulse; Multi-Material Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian; Peak overpressure; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; TNT equivalence,Curve fitting; Equivalence classes; Numerical methods; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian; Maximum impulse; Peak overpressure; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; TNT equivalence; Explosives; explosive; pentaerythrityl tetranitrate; trinitrotoluene; chemical compound; explosive; measurement method; overpressure; parameter estimation; simulation; air pollution; Article; chemical parameters; clinical evaluation; curve fitting; explosion; hydrodynamics; hyperbarism; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy,"Xiao, W.; University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Germany; email: weifang.xiao@unibw.de",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The gas pressure depends on the amount of the released energy, including the afterburning energy. A new analytical model is presented to predict the gas pressure developed in a confined volume, for different types of explosives, as function of the charge weight (W) and the free confined volume (V), considering the afterburning effect. The model is based on the detonation chemical reaction and on the calculation of a full or partial afterburning energy release due to the reaction of the fuels in the detonation products with the surrounding oxygen. Considering the detonation energy and the possible additional afterburning energy, the model demonstrates the different behavior of the gas pressure variation with W/V for different types of explosives. The equivalent TNT charge weight is calculated for each explosive. According to the analysis performed, the TNT equivalent factor varies with W/V.

2-s2.0-85068615979,"To obtain an explosive suitable for the explosive welding of foils and produce a new way to reuse demilitarized explosives, RDX powders and high amounts of hollow glass microballoons (GMs) were introduced into an emulsion matrix to reduce detonation velocity and critical thickness. The effect of different percentages of RDX on the detonation performance of the mixtures was systematically investigated. The results showed that the critical thickness decreased significantly with increasing RDX contents, and the detonation velocity at the critical thickness was almost unchanged for the different RDX contents. Thus, the as-created mixtures were suitable for the explosive welding of foils due to their low detonation velocities and low critical thicknesses. The brisance test results indicated that the brisance of the composite explosives increased with increasing RDX contents, and this trend was more remarkable at low RDX contents. All the energy output parameters of the underwater explosions also increased with increasing RDX contents. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Yang M., Ma H., Shen Z.",57202193173;13611987500;7403324093;,Effect of RDX powders on detonation characteristics of emulsion explosives,2019,Journal of Energetic Materials,37,4,,459,474,NA,16,10.1080/07370652.2019.1637480,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068615979&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1637480&partnerID=40&md5=c6055f424766760db718f832b6a33bfe,"CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, Department of Modern Mechanics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China; State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China","Yang, M., CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, Department of Modern Mechanics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China; Ma, H., CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, Department of Modern Mechanics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China; Shen, Z., CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, Department of Modern Mechanics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China",Emulsion explosives; explosive welding; foil; RDX powders,,"Ma, H.; CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, China; email: hhma@ustc.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85065977420,"A novel and simplified gradient IC-HRMS approach is presented in this work for forensic profiling of ionic energetic material residues, including low-order explosives and gunshot residue (GSR). This new method incorporated ethanolic eluents to facilitate direct coupling of IC and HRMS without auxiliary post-column infusion pumps that are traditionally used to assist with gas phase transfer. Ethanolic eluents also enabled better integration with an in-service protocol for direct analysis of high-order organic explosives by IC-HRMS, without requiring solvent exchange before injection. Excellent method performance was achieved, enabling both full scan qualitative and quantitative analysis, as required. In particular, linearity for 19 targeted compounds yielded R2 > 0.99 across several orders of magnitude, with trace analysis possible at the low-mid pg level. Reproducibility and mass accuracies were also excellent, with peak area %RSDs <10%, tR %RSDs <0.4% and δm/z < 3 ppm. The method was applied to targeted analysis of latent fingermarks and swabbed hand sweat samples to determine contact with a black-powder substitute containing nitrate, benzoate and perchlorate. When combined with principal component analysis (PCA), the effect of time since handling on recorded signals could be interpreted further in order to support forensic investigations. In a second, non-targeted application, PCA using full scan IC-HRMS data enabled classification of GSR from three different types of ammunition. An additional 20 markers of GSR were tentatively identified in silico, in addition to the 15 anions detected during targeted analysis. This new approach therefore streamlines and adds consistency and flexibility to forensic analysis of ionic energetic material. Furthermore, it also has implications for targeted, non-targeted and suspect screening applications in other fields by expanding the separation space to low molecular weight inorganic and organic anions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gallidabino M.D., Irlam R.C., Salt M.C., O'Donnell M., Beardah M.S., Barron L.P.",36135414600;57193189344;57208862113;57208755025;6506163935;58862392600;,Targeted and non-targeted forensic profiling of black powder substitutes and gunshot residue using gradient ion chromatography – high resolution mass spectrometry (IC-HRMS),2019,Analytica Chimica Acta,1072,,,1,14,NA,11,10.1016/j.aca.2019.04.048,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065977420&doi=10.1016%2fj.aca.2019.04.048&partnerID=40&md5=e8932c58ec56410a7751f5931770092d,"King's Forensics, Department of Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Centre for Forensic Science, Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University Newcastle, Ellison Building, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 8ST, United Kingdom; Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort HalsteadTN14 7BP, United Kingdom","Gallidabino, M.D., King's Forensics, Department of Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom, Centre for Forensic Science, Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University Newcastle, Ellison Building, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 8ST, United Kingdom; Irlam, R.C., King's Forensics, Department of Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom; Salt, M.C., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort HalsteadTN14 7BP, United Kingdom; O'Donnell, M., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort HalsteadTN14 7BP, United Kingdom; Beardah, M.S., Forensic Explosives Laboratory, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort HalsteadTN14 7BP, United Kingdom; Barron, L.P., King's Forensics, Department of Analytical, Environmental & Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NH, United Kingdom",Explosive analysis; Fingermarks; Forensic science; High resolution mass spectrometry; Ion chromatography; Non-targeted analysis,Drug products; Explosives; Forensic science; Inorganic compounds; Integrated circuits; Ion chromatography; Ions; Mass spectrometry; Timing circuits; Fingermarks; Forensic investigation; High resolution mass spectrometry; Low molecular weight; Non-targeted; Orders of magnitude; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Screening application; Principal component analysis; alcohol; organic solvent; Article; computer model; disease classification; forensic science; gas diffusion; gunshot injury; ion chromatography; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nonlinear system; principal component analysis; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis,"Gallidabino, M.D.; King's Forensics, 150 Stamford Street, United Kingdom; email: matteo.gallidabino@northumbria.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85061248081,"                             Development of organic nanoparticles with high fluorescence, good biocompatibility along with strong resistance to photobleaching through simple synthetic routes is important for diverse applications such as sensing and bioimaging. Herein, we present the development of a pyrene excimer nanoaggregate which shows aggregation induced emission (AIE) effect in a solvent mixture of THF and water. The pyrene based fluorescent probe, dimethyl-5-(pyren-1-ylmethyleneamino)isophthalate (5-DP) was synthesized through a simple single step condensation reaction from inexpensive reagents. The photophysical studies of nanoaggregated system further corroborates the AIE active behavior of 5-DP probe at different water fractions (ƒ                             w                              = 0% to 90%), where the hydrogen bonding interaction between imine and water molecules led to suppression of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) inducing significant enhancement in fluorescence. The highly photostable nanoaggregates were explored as a selective fluorescence “turn off” sensor for phenolic nitroaromatics and the chemo-selectivity was highly pronounced for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid), that showed efficient quenching in aqueous as well as solid phase, with a detection limit of 10 nM in aqueous medium. The quenching efficiency of the nanoaggregates can be ascribed to a combination of factors including efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer, inner filter effect and coulombic interaction between picric acid and the aggregated probe molecules. Further, random aggregation of the pyrene derivative could be controlled for the formation of fluorescent spherical nanoparticles using Pluoronics P-123 block copolymers as encapsulating agents. The resulting composite could be used as a neoteric cell imaging probe with significantly less cytotoxicity, thus showing their potential biological applications.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Panigrahi A., Sahu B.P., Mandani S., Nayak D., Giri S., Sarma T.K.",57205714097;55537540500;24477820200;57537692900;23034516400;7005304049;,AIE active fluorescent organic nanoaggregates for selective detection of phenolic-nitroaromatic explosives and cell imaging,2019,Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry,374,,,194,205,NA,46,10.1016/j.jphotochem.2019.01.029,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061248081&doi=10.1016%2fj.jphotochem.2019.01.029&partnerID=40&md5=57753b9a827aa0281dc5ee59783a1a54,"Discipline of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; Centre of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; School of Applied Science & Humanities, Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia, 721657, India","Panigrahi, A., Discipline of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; Sahu, B.P., Centre of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; Mandani, S., Discipline of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; Nayak, D., Centre of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India; Giri, S., School of Applied Science & Humanities, Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia, 721657, India; Sarma, T.K., Discipline of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Khandwa Road, Indore, 453552, India",Aggregation induced emission; Cell imaging; Electron transfer; Explosive detection; Fluorescent organic nanoaggregates,,"Sarma, T.K.; Discipline of Chemistry, Simrol, Khandwa Road, India; email: tridib@iiti.ac.in",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85062669745,"                             In this study, new hydrazide-imine conjugates (1–3) containing polyaromatic groups (pyrene, anthracene or phenanthrene) were prepared and used as fluorescent probes for the sensing of nitro-aromatic compounds. The compounds were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. X-ray analysis showed that the polyaromatic moieties of the compounds play an important role for the crystal packing of the structure. The compounds exhibit aggregation induced emissions (AIE) due to π-π stacking of poly aromatic groups of the compounds. This, in turn, effects the color coordinates (CIE) of the compounds. The fluorimetric sensing of nitrobenzene (NB), 4-nitrophenol (NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) were studied by photoluminescence spectroscopy. Fluorimetric titrations showed that the nitro-aromatic compounds showed a quenching effect in the emission band of the probes due to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The compounds showed better sensitivity towards nitrobenzene (NB) with low LOD values.

2-s2.0-85066397328,"Domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, are highly responsive to human communicative cues and can utilize gestures, such as pointing, to locate hidden rewards. This ability is thought to be the product of both genetic and behavioural selection, allowing dogs to adapt to life with humans. Dogs' responsiveness to human gestures can also lead to suboptimal choices when dogs readily follow misleading cues despite directly contradicting perceptual information such as odour cues. However, this bias likely reflects pet dogs' enculturation with humans and thus may not be representative of other populations of dogs. We investigated the ability of young dogs in training for explosives detection (N = 77) to locate a hidden reward using olfactory cues when presented in conflict with a deceptive communicative gesture in an object-choice task. We assessed performance at 3, 6 and 11 months of age using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. We found that, contrary to previous findings with pet dogs, responsiveness to human pointing decreased with age, whereas the ability to locate the reward by scent increased. Furthermore, a lack of susceptibility to deceptive social cues was predictive of future success as a detection dog. These findings further indicate the influence of ontogenetic effects on canine social cognition and demonstrate potential applications for the identification of suitable detection dogs. © 2019","Lazarowski L., Rogers B., Waggoner L.P., Katz J.S.",55932255000;57200016134;55982992900;57199104434;,When the nose knows: ontogenetic changes in detection dogs' (Canis familiaris) responsiveness to social and olfactory cues,2019,Animal Behaviour,153,,,61,68,NA,17,10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.05.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066397328&doi=10.1016%2fj.anbehav.2019.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=efcd9f86f8974db61fd60c4324eb7fc1,"Canine Performance Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States; Department of Psychology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States","Lazarowski, L., Canine Performance Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States; Rogers, B., Canine Performance Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States; Waggoner, L.P., Canine Performance Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States; Katz, J.S., Department of Psychology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States",Canis familiaris; detection dog; domestic dog; object-choice task; olfaction; social cognition,behavioral response; canid; domestic species; odor; olfaction; olfactory cue; ontogeny; performance assessment; recognition; social behavior; Canis familiaris,"Lazarowski, L.; Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine, 104 Greene Hall, United States; email: lucia.lazarowski@auburn.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The rate of curing, micro-scale structure, morphology, crystal type, impact sensitivity, and detonation ability of the sample were characterized and analyzed. The results show that the curing process of CL-20 based UV-curing explosive ink could be completed within 7 minutes after UV-curing for 3 minutes, revealing rapid curing speed. In the preparation process of CL-20 based explosive composite, the crystal type of CL-20 do not change. Compared with raw CL-20, the explosive composite has a lower impact sensitivity.

Crystallographic investigations reveal that 1 and 2 have tetrahedral and 3 has octahedral environment around the Cu(II) ion. By varying the solvent conditions and ligand derivatives, the topology can be interestingly tuned. TOPOS Pro provides topological conclusions that 1 is stabilized by unusual 2D + 2D → 3D polycatenation of layers lying in (110) and (110) planes with dihedral angle of 90° showing altogether fes, hcb, and SQL topologies. On the other hand, 2 exhibits a bey (3,4-c net) topology and 3 shows 4-fold interpenetration with the dia topology. The dc measurements for 1-3 performed on polycrystalline samples in a 0.1 T field confirm strong ferromagnetic behaviors for 1 and 2 and moderate antiferromagnetic behavior for 3.

Nanogram amounts of TNT sampled from metallic, granite and glove surfaces were detected and quantified using the Faraday equation applied to the voltammetric response of TNT immobilised on the electrode surface. Identification of TNT was possible due to the unique voltammetric behaviour obtained on the G-PLA sensor and efficient sampling due to the rough surface and flexibility of the device. Lead and copper determination by stripping voltammetry was also demonstrated on the same device, highlighting the possibility of detecting gunshot residues.

2-s2.0-85072056049,"Infrared laser absorption spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for probing physical and chemical properties of high-explosive detonations. A broadly tunable swept-wavelength external cavity quantum cascade laser operating in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) spectral region is used to measure transmission through explosive fireballs generated from 14 g charges of 4 different explosive types detonated in an enclosed chamber. Analysis of time-resolved transmission and emission at a 2 μs sampling rate shows the evolution of fireball infrared opacity in the first 10 ms after detonation. Broadband high-resolution absorption spectra acquired over the spectral range of 2050-2300 cm-1 (4.35-4.88 μm) at a 100 Hz rate are used to measure properties of fireball evolution over longer time scales out to 100 s. Path-integrated concentrations of combustion products CO, CO2, H2O, and N2O are measured and show evolutions over multiple time scales and significant differences between explosive types. Spectral analysis is used to characterize gas temperature and to measure broadband attenuation from absorption and scattering of particulates.

2-s2.0-85067439661,"Nanomotors represent a class of artificial machines that span the chasm between molecular motors and bigger micromotors. Their importance lies in the fact that to effectively navigate and perform tasks in a biological environment without alerting the action of the immune system, the maximal size of the object has to be well below 200 nm. Fully nanosized gold/silver core/shell plasmonic nanomotors using the seeded growth wet chemical approach, which allows high scalability of synthesis of the nanomotors compared to planar substrate-based methods, is presented. Using the nanoparticle tracking analysis, the catalysis driven enhanced diffusion of the plasmonic nanomotors in the presence of low concentrations of fuel is presented and shown that the prepared nanomotors are good candidates for a solution-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection of picric acid, a typical explosive. In addition to the mentioned effects, ligand-exchange is performed on the nanomotors to replace the surfactant with its thiolated analog, a combination which is already proven in literature to be stealthy to the immune response of the living organism. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, the potential of GC-VUV for investigations was examined, focusing on drug- and explosive precursors as well as chemical warfare simulants. The ability of VUV absorption spectra to differentiate isomers is presented, among others for nitroaromatics. In addition, the limit of detection for target compounds was determined to 0.7 ng absolute on column. Furthermore, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)was successfully implemented as alternative deconvolution approach and evaluated for the deconvolution of unknown substances. In comparison, the spectral library-based deconvolution was applied to a standard mixture and a simulated case study. The results reveal that the NMF is a useful additional tool for deconvolution because, unlike library-based deconvolution, it allows to investigate unknown substances as well. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Reiss R., Gruber B., Klingbeil S., Gröger T., Ehlert S., Zimmermann R.",57202384632;57183821100;56507310700;23667261900;57032298400;57203148908;,Evaluation and application of gas chromatography - vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy for drug- and explosive precursors and examination of non-negative matrix factorization for deconvolution,2019,Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy,219,,,129,134,NA,18,10.1016/j.saa.2019.04.032,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064707410&doi=10.1016%2fj.saa.2019.04.032&partnerID=40&md5=24be94f608251af3787de5977741ae59,"Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, University of Rostock, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Rostock, 18059, Germany; Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Comprehensive Molecular Analytics, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Ingolstädter Landstr. 1, Neuherberg, 85764, Germany","Reiss, R., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, University of Rostock, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Rostock, 18059, Germany; Gruber, B., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Comprehensive Molecular Analytics, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Ingolstädter Landstr. 1, Neuherberg, 85764, Germany; Klingbeil, S., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, University of Rostock, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Rostock, 18059, Germany; Gröger, T., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Comprehensive Molecular Analytics, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Ingolstädter Landstr. 1, Neuherberg, 85764, Germany; Ehlert, S., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, University of Rostock, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Rostock, 18059, Germany; Zimmermann, R., Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, University of Rostock, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Rostock, 18059, Germany, Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Comprehensive Molecular Analytics, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Ingolstädter Landstr. 1, Neuherberg, 85764, Germany",Deconvolution; Drugs; Forensic chemistry; Isomeric separation; Precursor; VUV,"Absorption spectroscopy; Chemical warfare; Deconvolution; Explosives; Factorization; Gas chromatography; Isomers; Oil field equipment; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Deconvolution approach; Drugs; Isomeric separation; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Precursor; Spectral libraries; Vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy; Vacuum ultraviolets; Matrix algebra; chemical warfare agent; drug; explosive; gas chromatography; isomerism; procedures; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; vacuum; Chemical Warfare Agents; Chromatography, Gas; Explosive Agents; Isomerism; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Vacuum","Ehlert, S.; Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Dr.-Lorenz-Weg 2, Germany; email: sven.ehlert@uni-rostock.de",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

This explosive is a complex mixture of 95–96% ammonium nitrate (AN) and 4–5% liquid hydrocarbons (fuel oil). In this study, we analyze a variety of ANFO explosive mixtures in order to classify their different sources of origin by observing the difference in fuel components. The study was performed by mixing ammonium nitrate with eight different diesel brands collected in Lincoln, UK in two seasons (winter and summer). The samples were extracted using appropriate solvent and extracts were subsequently analyzed in sextuplicate by gas chromatography―mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A classification model was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Lineal Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In this study, four fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents were observed by GC–MS in all summer samples but found lack in some winter sample resulting in seasonal variation effect. The classification of pre-blast ANFO samples was achieved using GC–MS and FTIR in a combination with PCA/LDA. The results significantly showed the variation of specific diesel components and providing different classification performance among ANFO samples with high classification performance. Therefore, this study can be beneficial in forensic investigation that the use of diesel components are able to classify among different ANFO samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Suppajariyawat P., Elie M., Baron M., Gonzalez-Rodriguez J.",35732769900;23491793600;7202116566;7004803809;,Classification of ANFO samples based on their fuel composition by GC–MS and FTIR combined with chemometrics,2019,Forensic Science International,301,,,415,425,NA,19,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.06.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067405790&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2019.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=c2940e5fd5c6b86de5b8c9bbba5d49ac,"School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories, Green Lane, Lincoln, Lincolnshire  LN6 7DL, United Kingdom; Central Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, 499 Sukpraprute Building 16th Floor, Prachachuen Rd., Bang-Sue, Bangkok, 10800, Thailand","Suppajariyawat, P., School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories, Green Lane, Lincoln, Lincolnshire  LN6 7DL, United Kingdom, Central Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, 499 Sukpraprute Building 16th Floor, Prachachuen Rd., Bang-Sue, Bangkok, 10800, Thailand; Elie, M., School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories, Green Lane, Lincoln, Lincolnshire  LN6 7DL, United Kingdom; Baron, M., School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories, Green Lane, Lincoln, Lincolnshire  LN6 7DL, United Kingdom; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, J., School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories, Green Lane, Lincoln, Lincolnshire  LN6 7DL, United Kingdom",ANFO explosives; Chemometrics; Diesel; FAMEs; FTIR; GCMS,ammonium nitrate; diesel fuel; fatty acid ester; fuel oil; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemometrics; classification; controlled study; extraction; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; mass fragmentography; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; United Kingdom; winter,"Gonzalez-Rodriguez, J.; School of Chemistry, Green Lane, United Kingdom; email: jgonzalezrodriguez@lincoln.ac.uk",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

In the present study, CL-20/HMX co-crystals with high purity, uniform morphology, well-proportioned size distribution, compact internal structure and reduced sensitivity were fabricated by a solvent-induced self-assembling approach using corresponding nanoparticles as the basic units. Such a CL-20/HMX co-crystal based on the self-assembly of a nano-explosive has been reported for the first time, providing a novel, high-yield, general and easily scaled-up method for the fabrication of energetic co-crystals. Notably, the formation processes of the as-synthesized co-crystals were determined as interfacial self-assembly at nanoparticle scale instead of the complete dissolution and nucleation process at the molecular level as observed with the traditional recrystallization technique. The completely formed CL-20/HMX co-crystal structure with few separate-assembled CL-20 or HMX crystals was charecterized by PXRD, TG-DSC, Raman, FT-IR, DG and SCXRD analyses. Additionally, the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds was confirmed by Terahertz (THz) analysis. The typical Avrami equation was constructed for modeling the kinetics of the assembly of CL-20/HMX co-crystals, and the self-assembly process can be generally summarized as the induction of nano-particles, oriented aggregation, surface integration and single co-crystal formation. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Zhang M., Tan Y., Zhao X., Zhang J., Huang S., Zhai Z., Liu Y., Yang Z.",57212449298;7402140081;56925673300;54582023700;55998492900;56426789000;27171434100;55507724500;,Seeking a novel energetic co-crystal strategy through the interfacial self-assembly of CL-20 and HMX nanocrystals,2019,CrystEngComm,22,1,,61,67,NA,26,10.1039/c9ce01447k,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076700811&doi=10.1039%2fc9ce01447k&partnerID=40&md5=82dcca3816178fd8641a7b7f6d1d594d,"School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Institute of Fluid Physic and Microsystem, Terahertz Research Center, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China","Zhang, M., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China, Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Tan, Y., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Zhao, X., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhang, J., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Huang, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhai, Z., Institute of Fluid Physic and Microsystem, Terahertz Research Center, CAEP, Mianyang, 621900, China; Liu, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Yang, Z., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China",,Explosives; Hydrogen bonds; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Particle size analysis; Self assembly; Synthesis (chemical); Co-crystal formation; Cocrystal structure; Complete dissolution; Interfacial self assemblies; Intermolecular hydrogen bonds; Oriented aggregation; Reduced sensitivity; Self assembly process; Crystal structure,"Liu, Y.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: liuyu307@caep.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

This study was intended to determine the basic physicochemical properties of MeNQ as well as potential environmental fate pathways. The solubility of MeNQ was determined to be 12.92±0.52 g/L and aqueous photolysis was found to efficiently degrade the munition, where its quantum yield and half-life were found to be 0.009 and 0.59 days, respectively. Hydrolysis was an insignificant degradation pathway resulting in 8.1 % degradation at pH 4, 2.6 % at pH 7, and 6.2 % at pH 9 after five days at an elevated temperature. Volatilization at environmentally relevant conditions was found to be insignificant as the molecule thermally degrades, leading to an inability to calculate Henry's Constant for volatilization from water.

2-s2.0-85102775548,"Mitigation of the peroxide explosive threat, specifically triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), is a priority among the law enforcement community, as scientists and canine (K9) units are constantly working to improve detection. We propose the use of paper spray ionization–high-resolution mass spectrometry (PSI-HRMS) for detection of peroxide explosives in biological matrices. Occurrence of peroxide explosives and/or their metabolites in biological samples, obtained from urine or blood tests, give scientific evidence of peroxide explosives exposure. PSI-HRMS promote analysis of samples in situ by eliminating laborious sample preparation steps. However, it increases matrix background issues, which were overcome by the formation of multiple alkali metal adducts with the peroxide explosives. Multiple ion formation increases confidence when identifying these peroxide explosives in direct sample analysis. Our previous work examined aspects of TATP metabolism. Herein, we investigate the excretion of a TATP glucuronide conjugate in the urine of bomb-sniffing dogs and demonstrate its detection using PSI from the in vivo sample.

2-s2.0-85126632973,"This paper describes an offline low-temperature derivatization method combined with gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) to enable compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of C and N in the explosive compound 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one (NTO). NTO is being used widely as a component of insensitive munition (IM) composites such as IMX-101, a formulation that is being used to replace the more shock sensitive TNT in artillery shells. The alkylation of NTO with methyl iodide (MeI) as the derivatization reagent was performed in acetone solution at room temperature using triethylamine (Et3N) as a base catalyst. The methylated product of NTO derivatization was identified as 4-methyl-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (MNTO). Accurate and reproducible results were achieved by systematic optimization of MeI and Et3N concentrations and reaction time. Isotopic values of MNTO obtained by GC-IRMS were normalized against those of two 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) in-house reference materials that had been calibrated with isotopic standard reference materials, USGS40 and USGS41a. The resulting method detection limit for derivatization/GC-IRMS of NTO was 788 ng of NTO, yielding a precision of ±0.3‰ for both δ13C and δ15N values in good agreement with δ13C and δ15N values for NTO determined by elemental analyzer-IRMS. © 2021 The Authors","Wang C., Heraty L.J., Li H., Fuller M.E., Hatzinger P.B., Sturchio N.C.",57195244044;57200159919;57506814100;7202312330;6602124610;7004475068;,"Method for derivatization and isotopic analysis of the insensitive munition compound 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO)",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials Letters,2,,100044,,,NA,1,10.1016/j.hazl.2021.100044,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126632973&doi=10.1016%2fj.hazl.2021.100044&partnerID=40&md5=cbeca8d15d3de100805bb3941a2660fe,"Department of Earth Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE  19716, United States; Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA  24061, United States; Aptim Federal Services, LLC, Lawrenceville, NJ  08648, United States","Wang, C., Department of Earth Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE  19716, United States; Heraty, L.J., Department of Earth Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE  19716, United States; Li, H., Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA  24061, United States; Fuller, M.E., Aptim Federal Services, LLC, Lawrenceville, NJ  08648, United States; Hatzinger, P.B., Aptim Federal Services, LLC, Lawrenceville, NJ  08648, United States; Sturchio, N.C., Department of Earth Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE  19716, United States","3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO); Derivatization; GC-IRMS; Insensitive munitions; Stable isotopes",,"Sturchio, N.C.; 255 Academy StreetUnited States; email: sturchio@udel.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85115746932,"Stable-isotope analysis of ammonium nitrate (AN) plays an important role for comparing and tracing the sources of AN samples. Numerous studies have reported the application of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for the stable-isotope analysis of AN. However, in real cases, AN is often mixed with liquid hydrocarbons, organic explosives, wood flour, and sodium chloride. Therefore, the purification of AN samples prior to IRMS analysis is essential. Based on the different solubilities of AN at different temperatures, AN samples were purified by recrystallization. The results show that recrystallization can effectively purify AN, and the isotope fractionation effect caused by recrystallization increases the stable-isotope ratio (δ15N increased by 0.07–0.14‰, δ18O increased by 0.15–0.33‰, and δ2H increased by 4.61–18.16‰). The change of δ15N and δ18O were close to the standard deviation values, and did not affect the differentiation of AN. δ2H was deemed unsuitable for AN differentiation, owing to isotopic exchange during recrystallization. Eight AN samples from different cities and four AN samples produced in different years and batches from the same manufacturer in China were analyzed after recrystallization. Both groups of AN samples could be distinguished by combining the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. Therefore, recrystallization can be used as a means of AN purification for the accurate determination of AN in ammonium nitrate fuel oil and explosive residues. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hu C., Mei H., Guo H., Yu Z., Zhu J.",57193389529;57217372863;55468662100;57273859900;57213066924;,Purification of ammonium nitrate via recrystallization for isotopic profiling using isotope ratio mass spectrometry,2021,Forensic Science International,328,,111009,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.111009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115746932&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2021.111009&partnerID=40&md5=68e90640d809b5c432d6979b2849b943,"Insititute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, China; Peoples’ Public Security University of China, China","Hu, C., Insititute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, China; Mei, H., Insititute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, China; Guo, H., Insititute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, China; Yu, Z., Peoples’ Public Security University of China, China; Zhu, J., Insititute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, China",Ammonium nitrate; Isotope ratio mass spectrometry; Purification; Recrystallization,ammonium nitrate; deuterium; explosive; fuel oil; nitrogen 15; oxygen 18; stable isotope; Article; China; controlled study; crystallization; feasibility study; fractionation; isotope analysis; isotope ratio mass spectrometry; isotope tracing; mass spectrometry; purification; solubility; temperature,"Zhu, J.; Insititute of Forensic Science, China; email: zhujun001cn@126.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The predominant experimental factors such as type and amount of deep eutectic solvent, extraction time, salt concentration and temperature that affect the extraction efficiency of nitroaromatic explosives were considered and optimized. By performing the process in optimal conditions, the calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.6–200 µg/L for 2,4,6-trinitrotolouene (TNT), 0.5–200 µg/L for 2,4-dinitrotolouene (2,4-DNT) and 0.5–200 µg/L for 2,6-dinitrotolouene (2,6-DNT). The limits of detection were 0.19, 0.16 and 0.14 µg/L for TNT, 2,4-DNT and 2.6-DNT, respectively. The relative standard deviations were between 4.8–6.4% (n = 6). The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of soil and water samples. At the different spiking levels recovery values ranged between 89 to 102% for soil and water samples, which indicates the negligible effect of the matrix on the extraction process. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Moazzen S., Zarei A.R., Mardi K.",57345299200;6603366767;55073168500;,Green Sample Preparation Based on Directly Suspended Droplet Microextraction using Deep Eutectic Solvent for Ultra-Trace Quantification of Nitroaromatic Explosives by High Performance Liquid Chromatography,2021,Journal of Analytical Chemistry,76,11,,1296,1304,NA,4,10.1134/S1061934821110083,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119323150&doi=10.1134%2fS1061934821110083&partnerID=40&md5=cf807e7d22a5cfdc329bf19d00ec1383,"Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, 15875-1774, Iran","Moazzen, S., Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, 15875-1774, Iran; Zarei, A.R., Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, 15875-1774, Iran; Mardi, K., Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, 15875-1774, Iran",deep eutectic solvent; directly suspended droplet microextraction; nitroaromatic explosive,Aromatic compounds; Drops; Eutectics; Explosives; Solvent extraction; Solvents; Deep eutectic solvents; Directly suspended droplet microextraction; Green samples; High-performance liquid chromatography; Nitroaromatic explosives; Sample preparation; Soil and water; Soil sample; Ultratraces; Water samples; High performance liquid chromatography,"Zarei, A.R.; Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Iran; email: zarei1349@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Landmines emit a chemical flux over time, and honeybees can collect the trace residues of explosives (as particles or as vapour) on their body hairs. This capability was exploited using a passive method allowing the honeybees to freely forage in a mined area, where trace explosives present in the environment stuck to the honeybee body, which were subsequently transferred onto an adsorbent material for analysis by a fluorescent polymer sensor. Potential false positive sources were investigated, namely common bee pheromones, the anti-varroa pesticide Amitraz, and the environment around a clean apiary, and no significant response was found to any from the sensor. The mined site gave a substantial response in the optical sensor films, with quenching efficiencies of up to 38%.

2-s2.0-85103668384,"The particle size of explosives plays a key role in the short-duration pulse shock initiation, and explosives with small grain size and large specific surface area (SSA) generally have preferable sensitivity properties. We have constructed a high-throughput microfluidic recrystallization platform, aiming to prepare ultrafine pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, C(CH2NO3)4) via a precisely controllable solvent/nonsolvent recrystallization process. Through this platform, the recrystallized PETN was produced with a particle size of about 2 μm, and its SSA was above 70-fold that of the raw PETN. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that the raw and microcrystalline PETN had a similar diffraction spectrum. The thermal analysis demonstrated that compared with the raw PETN, the microcrystalline PETN revealed better decomposition performances. Importantly, the short-duration pulse shock initiation sensitivity of microcrystalline PETN pellets was evaluated when subjected to an exploding foil initiator. The shock initiation threshold results were as follows: 50 % initiation voltage U (50 %)=1332 V, the corresponding capacitor storage energy was 195.2 mJ. Furthermore, the calculated shock pressure and shock duration imparting to the pellets were 9.61 GPa and 12.53 ns respectively, corresponding to the 3162 m/s threshold velocity. Finally, the enhanced sensitivity during the shock-to-detonation transition was further explained with the hot spot-based mechanism. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Yang Z., Zhu P., Zhang Q., Shi J.-Y., Wang K., Shen R.-Q.",57206915819;12781408400;57208187319;58361008400;57208190354;7202935837;,Microcrystalline PETN Prepared Using Microfluidic Recrystallization Platform and Its Performance Characterization,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,7,,1097,1106,NA,7,10.1002/prep.202000298,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103668384&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000298&partnerID=40&md5=1a0d503ab10773504ed2b5326912b521,"School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Xiaolingwei Street 200, Xuanwu District, Nanjing, 210094, China;

2-s2.0-85113986414,"In this study, we have developed a variable pressure operating hollow cathode discharge (HCD) ion source to investigate the gas phase ion-molecule reactions of nitroaromatic explosive compounds. The developed HCD ion source coupled MS system has also been validated as an analytical method to analyze explosives at trace levels. The ion source was designed in such a way that the plasma can be generated alternatively at high pressure (~30 Torr), medium pressure (~5 Torr) and low pressure (~1 Torr) regions. The plasma contains a sufficient amount of reactant ions, electrons and excited species, thus the gaseous analyte molecules were efficiently ionized when they passed through the plasma. In the ion-molecule reactions of the nitroaromatic explosives, the discharge products of NOx− (x = 2,3), O3 and HNO3 originating from the plasma-excited air were suggested to contribute to the formation of mostly [M − H]-, [M − NO]-, [M+NO3–HNO2]- and [M-NO+HNO3]- adduct ions at the higher ion source pressures (~5 and 28 Torr) while the electron rich plasma leads to the formation of molecular ion, M−•, at the lower ion source pressure (~1 Torr). Formation of the hydride-adduct ions of the nitroaromatic compounds reveals the surface-assisted Birch type reduction in the HCD plasma. The variety of spectral patterns in the air-assisted glow discharge would be useful for high through-put detection of TNT and TNT-related explosives. An ambient helium dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) ion source was also used and gave identical mass spectra of the nitroaromatic explosive compounds to those observed by the HCD ion source, but did not give any hydride-adduct ions of the explosive compounds.

2-s2.0-85115400359,"The shock initiation process of a pressed trinitrotoluene (TNT) at density of 1.563 g cm−3 was studied by manganese-copper gauge measurement experiments as well as numerical simulation for assessing the performance and detonation growth characteristics in such pressed samples. Through gap test, the shock pressure histories at different inner positions of the target TNT charges were measured. The parameterization on shock initiation model proposed by Lee & Tarver for numerical simulation were accomplished. The equation of state for unreacted explosive in the model was obtained by fitting Hugoniot data calculated from molecular dynamic simulation and shock temperature based on Walsh's solution. The equation of state for the detonation products was theoretically predicted by EXPLO5. Combining those procedures, the ignition and growth model for a pressed TNT was accurately parameterized together with experimental pressure history data. Experiment and simulation indicate that when the input pressures are 6.13 GPa and 8.67 GPa, respectively, the corresponding run distances to detonation are >9 mm and 6 mm. The calculated pressure growth histories at different inner positions of the pressed TNT sample can well reproduce the correspondingly measured values.

2-s2.0-85117372096,"Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosives, a popular choice for terrorists, have been used in many violent terrorist attacks all over the world. However, simple, rapid, and on-site detection methods of TATP are still lacking. Herein, we present a visual colorimetric method for on-site and rapid detection of TATP based on a Fe(ii)-promoted thermal decomposition process of TATP. We discovered that TATP can be decomposed into H2O2 under heating conditions, and it reacts with Fe2+ to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH) and Fe3+via the Fenton reaction. The resulting OH and Fe3+ further oxidize colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a yellow oxidized product (oxTMB). These reaction processes remarkably promote the chemical equilibrium shift and decrease the activation energy. Using the TATP-Fe2+-TMB ternary chromogenic system, the present colorimetric assay for TATP shows a dynamic range of 0.5-30 μM with a low detection limit of 0.12 μM. Additionally, common substances (e.g., inorganic salts, small organic substances, and polymers) do not interfere with TATP detection. This assay can be used for analyzing TATP in real water and camouflage samples. Furthermore, a test-paper-based method was also successfully developed for visual, rapid and on-site detection of TATP.

2-s2.0-85106495848,"Measuring of heat flow curves at temperatures near the in-service range have become a standard for stability and compatibility assessments of nitrocellulose (NC)-based energetic materials. The typical technique to realise this demand is heat flow microcalorimetry. The heat flow curves are the summarized effect of the rates of all the reaction heats in the mixture. The propellant composition has a significant influence on the shapes of the heat flow curves. To assess the stability on a firmer base, it is of interest to know what contributions to the total heat flow the individual reactions have from the NC decomposition and from the stabilizer reactions. This needs the simulation of the heat flow curves based on the individual reactions with their thermochemical data and their reaction rates. For this, the reaction enthalpies of all relevant reactions must be known. On these prerequisites was reported in part 1. With the data from there, the simulation of the heat flow curve of the ball powder propellant type K6210 was undertaken, using a reaction scheme for the nitrate ester decomposition and the DPA reactions.

2-s2.0-85102261071,"The detonation of a metalized explosive generates a fireball that has a spatially non-uniform distribution of particle concentration and gas temperature. The transient gas temperature field must be probed with ruggedized spatially- and temporally-resolved diagnostics. The use of in-situ thermocouples for temperature measurements within multiphase fireballs is demonstrated. Although the thermocouple temperature lags behind the local gas temperature, the transient gas temperature is assessed by modeling the sensor assuming first-order response and using two analysis methods: (1) when the thermocouple temperature trace reaches a local extrema, the thermocouple temperature is instantaneously equal to the local gas temperature, and (2) reconstructing the gas temperature trace using multiple co-located thermocouples of different lag responses. The temperature history within the fireball at various distances is presented for charges consisting of packed beds of particles saturated with liquid nitromethane. The results for reactive particles (Al, Ti, Zr) are compared with non-reactive particles (Fe), as well as homogeneous NM charges. For NM charges, a maximum gas temperature of about 1100 K occurs at times on the order of 100’s of milliseconds, less than the temperature of the burning soot in the fireball (∼1900 K). With Al particles, the gas temperature is spatially non-uniform due to particle jetting and non-uniform particle combustion, but gas temperatures up to about 1800 K are recorded for times up to 0.5 s, less than the temperature of the burning particles (∼2700 K). Inert particles act as a heat sink and the thermocouple temperatures recorded did not exceed 400 K. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Frost D.L., Clemenson J.-M., Goroshin S., Zhang F., Soo M.",7101949362;57203417028;6602503996;57223747432;55548106300;,Thermocouple Temperature Measurements in Metalized Explosive Fireballs,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,6,,899,911,NA,8,10.1002/prep.202000328,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102261071&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000328&partnerID=40&md5=029d988387879abb40f8eb0a6cd61716,"Dep't. of Mech.

2-s2.0-85114895908,"Neutron radiography (NR) can be used for the detection and characterisation of explosives having different macroscopic attenuation cross sections. However, if the explosives have similar macroscopic cross sections to neutrons, characterising them is not possible. In this investigation, an attempt is made to distinguish various explosives based on the attenuation cross section of these compounds to neutrons. A correlation between the grey level achieved in neutron image of each explosive taken in a thin walled shell and their corresponding macroscopic attenuation cross section is carried out. An attempt is made to study the possibility of detection of some low dense compounds kept inside pyro metallic cases using cone beam X-ray 3D computed tomography. X-ray CT sliced images of samples filled with calcium carbonate and epoxy can be easily distinguished from empty samples. Samples were tested in NR and X-ray CT facility to compare the results. It is observed that low dense compounds of small volume positioned inside a bulk volume of SS metal of a pyro element used in this study are giving sufficient contrast that makes it detectable in CT cross-sectional image. The study points towards usage of X-ray CT as an alternative tool for detecting the presence of explosives in pyro devices wherever NR imaging cannot be carried out due to wall thickness constraints. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Namboodiri G.N., Joseph M., Kumar M.C.S., Nallaperumal M., Moideenkutty K.K., Arumugam M., Kumar L.M., Jayaprakash J.",57208116614;57226572816;6602954979;57214684466;57226561885;57226563627;57210930149;57848518800;,X-ray computed tomography and thermal neutron radiography for detection of low dense compounds inside pyro elements used in space applications,2021,European Physical Journal Plus,136,9,945,,,NA,1,10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01910-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114895908&doi=10.1140%2fepjp%2fs13360-021-01910-1&partnerID=40&md5=a41d0aa7437a53daf73649c2e836d4a4,"Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; National Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli, 620015, India","Namboodiri, G.N., Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India, National Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli, 620015, India; Joseph, M., Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Kumar, M.C.S., National Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli, 620015, India; Nallaperumal, M., Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Moideenkutty, K.K., Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Arumugam, M., Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Kumar, L.M., Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India; Jayaprakash, J., Rocket Propellant Plant, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695022, India",,,"Namboodiri, G.N.; Rocket Propellant Plant, India; email: girish_nn@vssc.gov.in

The optical active method (OAM), based on PMMA optical fibers (250 μm diameter) and their radiation transmission loss when shocked, was used to characterize the detonation wave (DW) and shock wave (SW) in inert barriers and applied to measure the detonation pressure in condensed explosives. The detonation velocity and detonation pressure of a PBX based on PETN (86 % PETN, 14 % Sylgard), known as Seismoplast were measured. The OAM with protected optical probes (POP) was used to determine the mean detonation velocity (7337 m s−1), whereas the OAM with bare optical probes (BOP) was used to measure the induced shock velocities generated by Seismoplast on different thicknesses of PMMA (1–9 mm), aluminum and copper (1–7 mm).

2-s2.0-85113780848,"The detection of trace amounts of explosive materials is critical to the security at mass transit centers (e.g., airports and railway stations). In a typical screening process, a trap is used to probe a surface of interest to collect and transfer particulate residue to a detector for analysis. The collection of residues from the surface being probed is widely viewed as the limiting step in this process. A multi-institutional study was performed to establish a methodology for the evaluation of sampling media collection efficiencies. Dry deposited residues of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), C-4 (an RDX-based explosive), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were harvested from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic, ballistic nylon (NYL), and uncoated aluminum surfaces using muslin, Texwipe cotton, and stainless-steel mesh traps. Transfer and collection efficiencies of the sample media were calculated based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Dry transfer efficiencies (DTE%) to all tested surfaces were greater than 75%, with transfer to ABS plastic being the lowest. Collection efficiency (CE%) varied significantly across the traps and the surfaces, yet some conclusions can be drawn; nylon had the lowest CE% for all cases (∼10%), and the stainless steel mesh had the lowest CE% for the evaluated traps (∼20%). Though the testing parameters have been standardized among the participants to establish a framework for an independent comparison of contact sampling media and surfaces, substantial variations in the DTE% and the CE% were observed, suggesting that other variables can affect contact sampling.

According to the relationship between load and time, displacement was deduced. The correctness and reliability of the displacement were confirmed by comparing it with the displacement by the digital image correlation method (DIC). Combined with a high-speed camera, the impact process image was collected, and the initial fracture point was determined by the load-displacement curve. Then the impact absorbing energy corresponding to the initial fracture point was obtained by integrating the displacement with a load. The transverse impact strength of the propellant can be acquired based on the initial cross-sectional area of the sample. By comparison, it is found that the coefficient of variation and dispersion degree of the measurement results by the proposed method at low and room temperature are significantly less than those by the traditional pendulum test. That is, the consistency and repeatability of the proposed method are better.

The MMP model is based on the accumulation of decomposition gases at nucleation sites that load the surrounding TATB crystals and binder. This is the first cookoff model to use an analytical mechanics solution for compressibility and thermal expansion to describe internal pressurization caused by both temperature and decomposition occurring within closed-pore explosives. This approach produces more accurate predictions of ignition time and pressurization within high-density explosives than simple equation-of-state models. The current paper gives details of the reaction chemistry, model parameters, predicted uncertainty, and validation using experiments from multiple laboratories with errors less than 6 %.

The incorporation and anchoring of the chlorin to a nanostructured porous TiO2 matrix is achieved and optimized for its use as a fluorescent sensor.

Since, no approved remote detection methods were reported in current literature for this material, we performed hyper-spectral imaging and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) to a BCHMX sample under low laser fluence for determining the optimum laser wavelength used in any future BCHMX-LIF based remote detection systems. For this purpose, an experimental setup consisted of a sun spectrum lamp and hyper-spectral camera was built to illuminate and image white powder samples of BCHMX in comparison with the traditional explosives, HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane), RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane), PETN (2,2-Bis[(nitroxy)methyl]propane-1,3-diyldinitrate). The imaging reveals strong BCHMX sample absorption contrast among other samples at wavelength ranging from 400 to 410 nm. When light source was replaced by a 405 nm laser diode illuminator, a strong BCHMX sample LIF at the spectral range from 425 to 700 nm was observed under low laser fluence condition of 0.1 mJ/cm2. Finally, we demonstrated successfully the ability of the 405 nm LIF and the hyperspectral imaging technique to detect finger print traces of BCHMX on white cellulose fabric from a distance of 15 m and a detection limit of 1 μg/cm2. © 2020 The Authors","Ayoub H.S., El-Sherif A.F., Elbeih A.",57195549703;7005034384;37079089600;,"Hyperspectral imaging and remote trace detection of cis-1,3,4,6-tetranitrooctahydroimidazo-[4,5 d] imidazole (BCHMX) compared with traditional explosives using laser induced fluorescence",2021,Defence Technology,17,5,,1609,1616,NA,3,10.1016/j.dt.2020.09.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091501217&doi=10.1016%2fj.dt.2020.09.008&partnerID=40&md5=0c8cfbf94e0fe4cf26b521847874dc80,"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Egypt; Laser Photonics Research Center, Engineering Physics Department, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Explosives Department, Military Technical College, Kobry Elkobbah, Cairo, Egypt","Ayoub, H.S., Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Egypt; El-Sherif, A.F., Laser Photonics Research Center, Engineering Physics Department, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Elbeih, A., Explosives Department, Military Technical College, Kobry Elkobbah, Cairo, Egypt",BCHMX; Hyperspectral imaging; Laser induced fluorescence; Remote trace detection,"Explosives; Explosives detection; Fluorescence; Laser optics; Laser produced plasmas; Light sources; Plants (botany); Spectroscopy; Trace analysis; 1 ,3 ,5-trinitro-1 ,3 ,5-triazacyclohexane; Detection limits; Energetic compounds; Hyper-spectral cameras; Laser induced fluorescence; Laser wavelength; Remote detection; Trace detection; Hyperspectral imaging; Detection; Distance; Explosives; Fluorescence; Light Sources; Powder; Samples; Spectroscopy","Elbeih, A.; Explosives Department, Kobry Elkobbah, Egypt; email: elbeih.czech@gmail.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

This is a very important issue as it keeps the propellant as well as the surrounding safe from any possible mishap. Therefore, the determination of residual DPA/DPA derivatives in the propellant is of utmost importance. Various attempts have been made to determine residual DPA/derivatives content in the propellant. In this review the detection methods have been compiled and analysed for their implications, detection limit and standard deviation. The methods attempted for detection comprise volumetric, chromatographic, electroanalytical, spectroscopic and thermoanalytical techniques. The volumetric method was tried in the initial attempts by adopting chemical reactions. Chromatographic methods were reported by adopting different procedures and variations. These have been discussed in details. Electroanalytical methods have become one of the important techniques to determine the residual DPA that has been discussed in detail with incorporation of various modifications. Spectroscopic methods were also deployed to determine the DPA content in the propellant. The methods, being very straight forward and clean, have been considered effective in determination.

One of the most significant advantages of the statistical model is that it predicts well the influence of mesoscopic void size distribution and critical size of activated hot spots on the shock initiation and detonation growth of PBXs. The calculated pressure histories in both TATB-based LX-17 and HMX-based PBX9501 are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the shock initiation behavior of the HMX-based PBX is mainly controlled by the number density of hot spots and shows an accelerated reaction characteristic and that of the TATB-based PBX is determined by the combustion reaction process, which featured by a stable reaction characteristic. It is also found that the void size inside the explosive should be restricted as small as possible to effectively reduce the initiation sensitivity.

The thermal safety model not only considers the geometrical parameters of diamond tool and process parameters, but also integrates the kinetic law of friction-induced chemical reaction of PBXs chips. Moreover, the Arrhenius thermal decomposition of PBXs chips and its turning Logistic retardation growth model were also unified successfully, and the temperature measurement tool, thermal analysis tests and surrogate face cutting experiments were implemented separately. According to the controllable self-acceleration safe cutting criterion, this novel model reliably predicts the safe cutting zone of HMX-based PBXs. Finally, the turning experiments of PBXs validated that: (1) The combination of high cutting velocity and cutting temperature can induce a sufficient amount of PBXs chips to release uncontrollable chemical energy; (2) The frictional heating interface between the HMX crystal and the diamond tool tip is the most hazardous zone; (3) A reliable evaluation for the turning safety of PBXs requires detailed analyses on the cutting energy, friction time and hot spot distribution, which can be characterized by the theoretical model and cutting curve of T-v. © 2021 The Authors","Cao Z.M., Zong W.J., He C.L., Huang J.H., Liu W., Wei Z.Y.",58325443300;8272982700;56645418900;9638861800;55385834500;36603655100;,Thermal safety model of HMX-based explosives in diamond turning,2021,Materials and Design,205,,109698,,,NA,7,10.1016/j.matdes.2021.109698,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104279465&doi=10.1016%2fj.matdes.2021.109698&partnerID=40&md5=ee1e00af4dd0430b96bb38db56b7bf54,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Center for Precision Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150001, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Equipment Design and Manufacturing Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 30054, China","Cao, Z.M., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China, Center for Precision Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150001, China; Zong, W.J., Center for Precision Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150001, China; He, C.L., Tianjin Key Laboratory of Equipment Design and Manufacturing Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 30054, China; Huang, J.H., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Liu, W., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Wei, Z.Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China",Cutting temperature; Diamond turning; Explosives; Safe machining; Thermal safety,Decomposition; Diamonds; Explosives; Friction; Geometry; Temperature measurement; Comprehensive modeling; Cutting temperature; Diamond tool; Diamond turning; Polymer bonded explosives; Safe machining; Safety models; Thermal; Thermal safety; Tool parameter; Turning,"Zong, W.J.; P.O.

2-s2.0-85105880329,"Based on the experimental method of projectile penetration into the concrete target, different excitation by deceleration of polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) was achieved by controlling the length of steel pillars behind PBXs. A series of impact tests were conducted to study the mechanical response of PBXs with different initial densities under different excitation by deceleration. A physical model was developed to describe the viscoelastic-plastic deformation of PBXs. The plastic part was added on the basis of the viscoelastic statistical crack mechanical model (Visco-SCRAM) model, and the compaction behavior of charge in different environments was characterized based on the Heckel compaction equation. The model was implemented in LS-DYNA, and the simulation results were verified by the experiments. The dynamic mechanical behavior of PBXs under different excitation by deceleration was studied from the macroscopic and mesoscale aspects.

2-s2.0-85100679127,"Explosives are often used in industry, geology, mining, and other applications, but it is not always clear what remains after a detonation or the fate and transport of any residual material. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent intact molecules of high explosive (HE) compounds are detectable and quantifiable from post-detonation dust and particulates in a field experiment with varied topography. We focused on HMX (1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), which is less studied in field detonation literature, as the primary explosive material and RDX (1,3,5-Trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine) as the secondary material. The experiment was conducted at Site 300, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Experimental Test Site, in California, USA. Two 20.4 kg and one 40.8 kg above ground explosions (primarily comprised of LX-14, an HMX-based polymer-bonded high explosive) were detonated on an open-air firing area on separate days. The complex terrain of the firing area (e.g., buildings, berm, low-height obstacles) was advantageous to study HE deposition in relation to plume dynamics. Three types of samples were collected up to 100 m away from each shot: surface swipes of aluminum plates, surface swipes of fixed objects, and filters from air samples. We used atmospheric flow tube-mass spectrometry (AFT-MS) to quantify picogram levels of molecular residue of HE material in the post-detonation dust. An aliquot of sample extract in methanol (e.g., 1 μL of 0.5 mL) was placed onto a resistive material and then thermally desorbed into the AFT-MS. We successfully detected and quantified both HMX and RDX in many of the samples. Based on mass (pg) detected and solution dilution, we back-calculated the mass collected on the swipe or filter (ng per sample). The aerial distribution of molecular residue was consistent with the path of the plume, which was strongly determined by wind speed and direction at the time of each shot. The quantity of material detected appeared to correlate more with distance from the shot and the wind conditions than with shot size. This study demonstrates that the picogram detection levels of AFT-MS are well-suited for quantification of analytes (e.g., HMX and RDX) in environmental samples. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Denis E.H., Morrison K.A., Wharton S., Phillips S., Myers S.C., Foxe M.P., Ewing R.G.",55261283200;57183724800;8525944000;57221942807;7402640619;26655462700;55425711200;,Trace explosive residue detection of HMX and RDX in post-detonation dust from an open-air environment,2021,Talanta,227,,122124,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122124,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100679127&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2021.122124&partnerID=40&md5=f75711e6491472355ae0e819e23291ec,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, United States; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States","Denis, E.H., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, United States; Morrison, K.A., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, United States; Wharton, S., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Phillips, S., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Myers, S.C., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Foxe, M.P., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, United States; Ewing, R.G., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, United States",Environment; Explosive; HMX; RDX; Residue; Trace detection,Air quality; Antennas; Dust; Explosives detection; Filtration; Mass spectrometry; Topography; Wind; Aerial distribution; Environmental sample; Explosive residues; Fate and transport; Lawrence livermore national laboratories; Residual materials; Secondary materials; Wind speed and directions; Detonation,"Denis, E.H.; Pacific Northwest National LaboratoryUnited States; email: elizabeth.denis@pnnl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85114990529,"Background: Blast related deaths are often shrouded by diagnostic and medicolegal complexities requiring multidisciplinary expertise in order to gauge accurate identification of the victims and document scientific investigations comprehensively. In the advent of more sophisticated technology, anthropologic methods can now be applied into post mortem imaging interpretation. The traditional imaging roles of characterizing osseous fragmentation, detecting and localizing foreign bodies can be expanded to simulate and support physical anthropologic examination to assist in documentation for court proceedings. Case presentation: An assemblage of unidentified, incomplete, highly fragmented skeletal remains were found scattered on a bare area of land in a forest. There was evidence of an explosion given the pattern of scattered evidentiary material of explosive and ballistic nature. Laboratory analysis of white powder found within the explosive material confirmed the presence of high impact C4-explosive trace containing cyclotrimethylene trinitramin [Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX)] & pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). It took meticulous multidisciplinary efforts to confirm the identity of the victim that was marred by the severe fragmentation and skeletalization of the remains. The initial radiologic interpretation focused more on identification of foreign bodies and supporting documentation of fragmentation. With the current availability of post computed tomography (PMCT) in our center, we reexamined the value and potential of PMXR and PMCT as an adjunctive tool for biological profiling. Conclusion: This was the first case of C4-blast related death reported in Malaysia. The multidisciplinary approach in efforts to identify the victim may serve as a guide in managing, coordinating and maximizing the expertise of different forensic specialists, with emphasis on anthropologic and radiologic collaboration. © 2021","Wong Y.-L., Khoo L.S., Ibrahim M.A., Mohamad Noor M.H., Mahmood M.S.",57260639900;57189043272;55358169200;57205754941;37093426500;,The first case of C4-Blast related death in Malaysia: A multidisciplinary approach illustrated with emphasis on conjoint anthropologic and radiologic expertise in forensic identification of skeletal remains,2021,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,83,,102253,,,NA,1,10.1016/j.jflm.2021.102253,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114990529&doi=10.1016%2fj.jflm.2021.102253&partnerID=40&md5=59b1fc5af62e3386a9861d546bf35f34,"Department of Radiology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia; National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM), Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia","Wong, Y.-L., Department of Radiology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia; Khoo, L.S., National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM), Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia; Ibrahim, M.A., National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM), Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia; Mohamad Noor, M.H., Department of Radiology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia; Mahmood, M.S., National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM), Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Malaysia",Anthropology; Biological profiling; Blast related injury; Forensic identification; Post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT); Post-mortem radiograph (PMXR),"cyclonite; explosive; pentaerythrityl tetranitrate; explosive; Article; ballistics; blast injury; body remains; bone radiography; case report; clinical article; court; disease simulation; explosion; female; foreign body; forensic anthropology; forensic identification; forensic medicine; forest; human; human tissue; laboratory test; Malaysia; male; medical documentation; physical examination; postmortem computed tomography; powder; victim; adult; anatomy and histology; body remains; bone; bone age determination; diagnostic imaging; forensic anthropology; forensic science; injury; procedures; radiography; sex determination; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Age Determination by Skeleton; Blast Injuries; Body Remains; Bone and Bones; Explosive Agents; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Malaysia; Radiography; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Khoo, L.S.; National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Jalan Pahang, Malaysia; email: khoolaysee@yahoo.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Both phlegmatized peroxides passed the Koenen Tube and Thermal Stability Test according to the UN recommendation on the transport of dangerous goods test manual.

2-s2.0-85110169046,"Ammonium perchlorate (AP) occupies an important position in solid propellants. However, the increase of moisture content in AP will seriously affect its combustion performance and mechanical properties, resulting in the abnormal use of solid propellants, which may bring serious security risks. There are very few studies on the accurate measurement of AP moisture content, which makes this study of great value and significance. In this paper, the optical parameters of aqueous AP samples were measured by terahertz time domain spectroscopy. Combined with chemometrics, five quantitative prediction models were constructed.

The diffusion study of labile chemical species in HTPB and HTPB-XT propellants (with low and high viscosity hydrocarbon oils) was carried out. Analog cartons simulating the propellant of the main motor were cast with 120 kg mix level propellant and subjected to an aging study at room temperature and an accelerated condition at different intervals over a period of 100 days. Samples from the cartons were subjected to Soxhlet extraction and analyzed for concentration of chemical species in insulation rubber as well as in propellant. The change in concentration of species from the insulation to interior propellant was also studied and compared with HTPB propellant. The diffusion of the other chemicals along with plasticizer was also observed in these studies. Nonax-D, a solid ingredient also migrated due to its solubility in the propellant matrix but not due to the movement of solid particles. Due to the migration of propellant chemicals into insulation, there was a significant reduction in their initial concentrations in the propellant regions adjacent to the insulation surface.

2-s2.0-85103654694,"The block copolymer of 3,3’-bis(azidomethy) oxetane and glycidyl azide polymer (p(BAMO)-b-GAP) is an ideal energetic binder for solid propellants. In this work, the enthalpy of formation of p(BAMO)-b-GAP was first investigated by the heat of combustion experimental method and group additivity method. Meanwhile, the energetic characteristics of solid propellants based on the copolymer were systematically calculated. The results proved that the ΔfH of p(BAMO)-b-GAP could be estimated accurately by two methods and the positive ΔfH values were obtained. Dual-oxidant formulas were designed in which AP was replaced gradually by some chlorine-free high-energy materials. The calculation results showed when AP was gradually replaced by RDX or HMX, the energy level of propellants based on p(BAMO)-b-GAP was improved first but then decreased with AP content further decreased, indicating there was an optimum ratio between AP and its alternative. However, when AP was replaced by CL-20 or ADN, the values of Isp were improved steadily. When less than 40 % AP was replaced, the contribution to the energy level of propellant by RDX or HMX was even more than that by CL-20. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Xu R., Li Z., Chen Y., Pei J., Zhang J.",35308110700;35203438200;35209684900;55272381100;57189999102;,Enthalpy of Formation of p(BAMO)-b-GAP and Energetic Characteristics of Solid Propellants Based on the Copolymer,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,6,,969,974,NA,7,10.1002/prep.202000244,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103654694&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000244&partnerID=40&md5=ea685ae1d979342c6ee064ad81258cae,"Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710072, China; Sichuan University, Chengdu, Chengdu, Sichuan  610065, China; Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710065, China","Xu, R., Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710072, China; Li, Z., Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710072, China, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Chengdu, Sichuan  610065, China; Chen, Y., Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710072, China; Pei, J., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710065, China; Zhang, J., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, Shaanxi  710065, China",copolymer; energetic characteristics; enthalpy of formation; p(BAMO)-b-GAP; propellant,Block copolymers; Enthalpy; Explosives; Calculation results; Energetic characteristics; Enthalpy of formation; Experimental methods; Glycidyl azide polymer; Group additivity methods; Heat of combustion; High energy materials; Solid propellants,"Xu, R.; Northwestern Polytechnical UniversityChina; email: nutar@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85089443691,"This study aimed to develop a fast and reliable protocol for Trinitrophenol-Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TNP-Tris) detection applying a β-lactamase-fusion protein of choice, the natural product-based immunoreagent tool of competitive sensitivity developed herein for the first time. Since the fusion protein 11B3-scFv-β-lactamase is constructed from a scFv-antibody (11B3) linked to an enzyme (β-lactamase), the step related to the use of secondary antibody in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is completely omitted. Indeed, this fusion protein itself serves both as binding mean of the antigen model and detecting agent, due to the presence of the naturally occurring enzyme. In such a way, it actually affords the one-step TNP-Tris detection reaching a promising LOD value of 45 ± 2 fmol or 157 ± 6 pg/mL. Taken all together, the current protocol does represent much cheaper and significantly less-time consuming alternative compared both to the recombinant antibodies and recombinant phages, previously designed means in our labs for the same purpose. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Simonovic M., Ostojic S., Micic D., Bisercic-Savic M., Mix T., Glumac M., Pejin B.",55905081300;56264311500;55811261600;57209110658;6602529227;57190438558;24336239400;,A novel and effective natural product-based immunodetection tool for TNT-like compounds,2022,Natural Product Research,36,3,,857,861,NA,2,10.1080/14786419.2020.1806269,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089443691&doi=10.1080%2f14786419.2020.1806269&partnerID=40&md5=efd09e1d75c829cb51b6b595119cb53c,"Institute of General and Physical Chemistry, IOFH, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Nuclear Sciences “Vinca”, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; School of Food Science and Biotechnology–SFSB, Food Oral Processing Laboratory, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute for Multidisciplinary Research–IMSI, Department of Life Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia","Simonovic, M., Institute of General and Physical Chemistry, IOFH, Belgrade, Serbia; Ostojic, S., Institute of General and Physical Chemistry, IOFH, Belgrade, Serbia; Micic, D., Institute of General and Physical Chemistry, IOFH, Belgrade, Serbia; Bisercic-Savic, M., Institute of Nuclear Sciences “Vinca”, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Mix, T., Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Glumac, M., School of Food Science and Biotechnology–SFSB, Food Oral Processing Laboratory, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China; Pejin, B., Institute for Multidisciplinary Research–IMSI, Department of Life Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",11B3-scFv-antibody; 11B3-scFv-β-lactamase; TNP-Tris; β-lactamase,beta lactamase; fusion protein; natural product; single chain fragment variable antibody; trinitrotoluene; biological product; antigen binding; Article; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunodetection; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; sensitivity analysis; Biological Products; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Trinitrotoluene,"Glumac, M.; School of Food Science and Biotechnology–SFSB, China; email: mladensimonovic@gmail.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

In this study, we introduce a fluorescent biosensor based on porous biocompatible microspheres loaded with a bioreporter for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microbeads were designed as biosensors embedded with the bacterial bioreporters. The genetically engineered bacterial bioreporter can express a green fluorescent protein in response to nitroaromatic compounds (e.g., trinitrotoluene and dinitrotoluene). The modified surface structure in microbeads provides a large surface area, as well as easy penetration, and increases the number of attached bioreporters for enhanced fluorescent signals of biosensors. Moreover, the addition of the M13 bacteriophage in open porous microbeads significantly amplified the fluorescence signal for detection by the π-π interaction between peptides in the M13 bacteriophage and nitroaromatic compounds. The modification of the surface morphology, as well as the genetically engineered M13 phage, significantly amplifies the fluorescence signal, which makes the detection of explosives easier, and has great potential for the stand-off remote sensing of TNT buried in the field. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Qiao T., Kim S., Lee W., Lee H.",57207818874;57927675200;7407086982;57192499672;,An enhanced fluorescence detection of a nitroaromatic compound using bacteria embedded in porous poly lactic-: Co -glycolic acid microbeads,2021,Analyst,146,14,,4615,4621,NA,5,10.1039/d1an00510c,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110060941&doi=10.1039%2fd1an00510c&partnerID=40&md5=0aaa06f3afb000b9d80e20492f8edace,"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kookmin Univ., 77 Jeongneung-ro Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Department of Chemistry, Sejong Univ., Neungdong-ro 209 Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, 143747, South Korea","Qiao, T., Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kookmin Univ., 77 Jeongneung-ro Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Kim, S., Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kookmin Univ., 77 Jeongneung-ro Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Lee, W., Department of Chemistry, Sejong Univ., Neungdong-ro 209 Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, 143747, South Korea; Lee, H., Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kookmin Univ., 77 Jeongneung-ro Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea",,Aromatic compounds; Bacteriophages; Biocompatibility; Biosensors; Cobalt; Explosives; Explosives detection; Genetic engineering; Microbeads; Morphology; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Surface morphology; Detection of explosives; Enhanced fluorescence; Fluorescence signals; Fluorescent signals; Green fluorescent protein; Large surface area; Nitroaromatic compound; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Fluorescence; explosive; glycol; glycolic acid; microsphere; trinitrotoluene; bacterium; human; porosity; Bacteria; Explosive Agents; Glycolates; Glycols; Humans; Microspheres; Porosity; Trinitrotoluene,"Lee, H.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, 77 Jeongneung-ro Seongbuk-gu, South Korea; email: hyunjung@kookmin.ac.kr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85105867522,"In recent times, studies about remote-sensing methods have focused on improving variables like sensing distance, sensitivity, and power consumption of available remote-sensing methods. The main target of this study is to improve these variables for the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) method, in addition to determining upper surface geometry of the sheath with the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to allow detection of buried ferromagnetic-sheathed explosives, minimize the number of false alarms, and thus shorten the scanning time. The classification process with the SVM algorithm separates this study from others. In line with this, instead of an external magnetic field source, in this study, the Earth's magnetic field was used with a TE100 fluxgate sensor, which has very low power consumption, used as a magnetic sensor to develop a highly sensitive new magnetic measurement and detection system. The system identifies anomalies in the vertical component of the Earth's magnetic field due to the magnetic characteristics of the buried sample in order to determine both the coordinates of the buried object within the scanning field and the upper surface geometry. The system is formed using a five-axis movement CNC platform including sensors and camera. Software was developed using python programming language with a QT graphical user interface (GUI) in order to control the CNC platform, take photographs of the soil, and process sensor data to ensure identification of the upper surface shape of the object under the soil. After obtaining all data for a 30×30 cm2 scanning area, the software colors the data from blue to red and visualizes this transparently above a photograph of the soil on the monitor. After this stage, a model is created using thresholding, selective search algorithm, and SVM in order to identify the location and upper surface shape of the sample located within the measurement region. Tests performed after SVM training determined the system can classify the upper surface geometry of buried samples with 88% success.  © 1965-2012 IEEE.","Gunes H., Bicakci S., Citak H., Coramik M., Ege Y.",57189074598;56133519500;55767066200;56578472900;19638410900;,Buried Magnetic Material Detection System: An SVM Algorithm Application,2021,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,57,7,9424626,,,NA,1,10.1109/TMAG.2021.3077864,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105867522&doi=10.1109%2fTMAG.2021.3077864&partnerID=40&md5=234709c3173e6b4791d4d3393905b373,"Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Balikesir Vocational High School, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Department of Physics, Necatibey Faculty of Education, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey","Gunes, H., Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Bicakci, S., Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Citak, H., Balikesir Vocational High School, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Coramik, M., Department of Physics, Necatibey Faculty of Education, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey; Ege, Y., Department of Physics, Necatibey Faculty of Education, Balikesir University, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey",Buried material; ferromagnetic sheath; fluxgate sensor; magnetic anomaly; remote sensing,Anomaly detection; Computer programming; Computer software; Electric power utilization; Explosives detection; Geometry; Graphical user interfaces; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Photography; Remote sensing; Scanning; Soils; Classification process; External magnetic field; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Magnetic anomaly detection; Magnetic characteristic; Number of false alarms; Python programming language; Support vector machines algorithms; Support vector machines,"Ege, Y.; Department of Physics, Turkey; email: yavuzege@gmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85120604872,"Introduction The objective was to report on the experience of the French Army Health Service in the management of blast injury of the hands related to warfare explosive devices. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in the Percy Military Hospital (role 4 medical treatment facility) among French soldiers who presented with a combat-related blast injury of the hand between 2002 and 2018. The functional result was assessed by the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) and the Orthotics and Prosthetics User Survey (OPUS, upper extremity functional status) scores. Proximal amputations (PAs) and distal amputations (DAs) were distinguished for the analysis. Results Fifteen patients with a mean age of 31±8 years were included. They totalised 20 blasted hands. There were 16 traumatic amputations: 8 in each of the PA and DA groups. Twelve patients had additional injuries, four of which were polytraumatic. Skin closure time and flap use were higher in the DA group. Only one thumb reconstruction was performed. At a mean follow-up of 6.5±4 years, the number of amputees wearing a prosthesis was higher in the PA group. The mean DASH and OPUS scores were 35.5%±24.0% and 64.0%±19.0%, respectively, with no difference between the two groups. Conclusion The severity of hand blasts related to warfare explosive devices requires the systematic application of damage control surgery. PAs are frequent and secondary reconstruction options are limited. The functional result is poor and similar between proximal and distal amputees.  © 2021 Authors","Pfister G., Murison J.-C., Grosset A., Duhoux A., Lapeyre E., Bauer B., Mathieu L.",57205695755;56971195200;57193867457;54419851700;14323345200;7202816365;16203760400;,Blast injury of the hand related to warfare explosive devices: Experience from the French Military Health Service,2021,BMJ Military Health,167,6,,393,397,NA,3,10.1136/jramc-2019-001326,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120604872&doi=10.1136%2fjramc-2019-001326&partnerID=40&md5=267a5c5edb0277459c4242625c5d8844,"Hopital d'Instruction des Armees Percy, Clamart, France; Department of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Antony Private Hospital, Antony, France","Pfister, G., Hopital d'Instruction des Armees Percy, Clamart, France; Murison, J.-C., Department of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Grosset, A., Department of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Duhoux, A., Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Lapeyre, E., Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France; Bauer, B., Antony Private Hospital, Antony, France; Mathieu, L., Department of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, Percy Military Hospital, Clamart, France",blast injury; damage control; hand; military; prosthetic fitting; surgery,"adult; amputee; Article; battle injury; blast injury; bomb; brachial plexus injury; clinical article; debridement; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); disarticulation; follow up; fracture fixation; France; free tissue graft; gunshot injury; hand amputation; hand injury; hemorrhagic shock; human; index finger; inguinal flap; injury severity; microsurgery; middle aged; military health service; military hospital; multiple trauma; neuropathic pain; open fracture; pedicled skin flap; priority journal; prosthetic fitting; retrospective study; thumb reconstruction; tissue flap; traumatic amputation; young adult; blast injury; warfare; explosive; Adult; Blast Injuries; Explosive Agents; Humans; Military Health Services; Retrospective Studies; Warfare; Young Adult","Pfister, G.; Hopital d'Instruction des Armees PercyFrance; email: georgespfister@hotmail.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85117267306,"To have a deep understanding of the effects of surface wettability on the mechanical sensitivity and rheological characteristics of PBX slurry, CL-20 particles with hydrophilic property was prepared through a polymerization process of dopamine, and CL-20 particles with hydrophobic property were prepared through a condensation polymerization process of hexadecyltrimethoxylsilane. The morphology, surface element content and surface wettability of CL-20 crystals before and after modification were characterized by scanning electronic microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle test. The rheological characteristics of CL-20 based PBX slurry showed that the interaction between explosive particles and binder was changed with different surface wettability of CL-20. The weaker interaction between CL-20@hydrophobic and binder lead to weaker solid-liquid friction, resulted in lower apparent viscosities of CL-20@hydrophobic based PBX slurry at high shear rate. The mechanical sensitivity of wax coated CL-20 with different surface wettability was tested. CL-20@hydrophobic-wax exhibited better mechanical stability compared to CL-20-wax and CL-20@hydrophilic-wax, probably owning to the weaker interaction between CL-20@hydrophobic surface and wax. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Duan S., Ding F., Sun H., Xiao C., Li S., Zhu Q.",57193498607;57298936600;57299852000;57190401846;12141531700;57190406414;,Construction of CL-20 Surface Layer with Different Wetting Properties and its Effect on Slurry Rheological Behavior and Mechanical Sensitivities,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,12,,1837,1843,NA,3,10.1002/prep.202100129,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117267306&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202100129&partnerID=40&md5=75919fc619a4b24ef234025d40da937c,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China","Duan, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Ding, F., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Sun, H., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Xiao, C., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Li, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China; Zhu, Q., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Sichuan, Mianyang, 621999, China",CL-20; Interfacial performance; Mechanical sensitivities; Wettability properties,Amines; Contact angle; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Mechanical stability; Morphology; Polycondensation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; CL-20; Hydrophobics; Interfacial performance; Mechanical sensitivity; Polymerization process; Property; Rheological characteristics; Surface wettability; Weak interactions; Wettability property; Wetting,"Zhu, Q.; Institute of Chemical Materials, Sichuan, China; email: zhuqing@caep.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85122810835,"The aim of this study was to investigate the preparation of urea nitrate (UN) using a range of urea sources followed by characterisation with analytical techniques routine to explosive analysis. The UN was prepared from lab grade urea, fertiliser urea, urea cold packs, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and Osmocote plant feed, resulting in six samples of UN as the Osmocote plant feed produced a blue and yellow product due to variation between products purchased at different times. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy revealed no notable differences between the samples apart from the blue UN product, which had a distinct peak in the IR spectra at 1150 cm−1. The Osmocote products could be discriminated by scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and ion chromatography (IC), as bulk samples contained a range of trace metals and ions. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) found 9 elements present at varying concentrations throughout the samples. The Osmocote products could be identified by the concentration of manganese, copper, and molybdenum while the DEF product could be discriminated as it contained a high concentration of nickel compared to other samples. ICP-MS has potential to further discriminate between the lab grade, fertiliser and cold pack samples, however, additional statistical and chemometric analysis is necessary.

Methods: Of the 82 injured cases admitted to the emergency department within the first six hours after the explosion, those who were radiologically evaluated were included in this retrospective and descriptive study. To analyze and identify the distribution of primary, secondary, and tertiary injuries, they were classified according to the body areas as head-neck, thorax, abdominopelvic, extremity, and vertebra. Results: The mean age (mean ± SD) of 63 patients included in the study was 28.6 ± 10.2 years. Twenty-four (38.1%) of the injured patients were female and 39 (61.9%) were male. Secondary blast injury was the most common type of injury in the study group with a rate of 39/63 (62%). The total number of bomb fragments was 235, of which 113 (47.8%) were seen in the head and neck region, followed by 86 (36.5%) in the extremities. There were 10 patients (15.9%) with lung injury and 13 (20.6%) with tympanic membrane perforation due to the primary blast mechanism.

On the basis of previous studies, chemical reaction equations, Hess’ law and Avogadro’s law were all incorporated in this process because of the non-ideal detonations of aluminized explosives. The EOS parameters were determined for explosive formulations comprising pure CL-20 as well as aluminized versions and compared to literature reports. Calculated pressure-specific volume curves were in good agreement with prior studies. A 50 mm cylinder test using a CL-20/Al/wax composition with a 75/20/5 mass ratio was conducted and the calculated EOS parameters were used to simulate the expansion of the cylinder wall. The experimental and simulation plots were found to agree within 5%, which confirms the validity of this method with regard to engineering analyses. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Mao X., Zheng Y., Shen F., Wang Y., Wang X., Li Y.",57201723516;57192651843;57204529717;57219364379;56013475600;57193320302;,A Method for Calculating the JWL Equation of State Parameters for the Detonation Products of CL-20-Based Aluminized Explosives,2022,Journal of Energetic Materials,40,2,,182,205,NA,7,10.1080/07370652.2020.1854370,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097615393&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2020.1854370&partnerID=40&md5=6551cf257a17a12ed73099024bb206a8,"School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; ZNDY Ministerial Key Laboratory, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi’an, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Mao, X., School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Zheng, Y., ZNDY Ministerial Key Laboratory, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Shen, F., Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi’an, China; Wang, Y., School of Energy and Power Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Wang, X., School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Li, Y., School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China",aluminized explosives; CL-20; cylinder test; JWL equation of state; LS-DYNA simulation,,"Zheng, Y.; ZNDY Ministerial Key Laboratory, Jiangsu Province, China; email: zhengyu@njust.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85103791526,"The article claims that to those affected, disaster is an existential experience. For them, it is an unexpected existential ‘event’ clearly separating a ‘before’ from an ‘after’. In the academic disaster domain however the ‘disaster as event’ is being eroded both by complexity approaches and critical approaches, which both, if for different reasons, consider disaster ‘normal’. By the example of the Enschede, the Netherlands, urban fireworks explosion of 2000 I argue that we should not only celebrate community resilience but take much more seriously how disasters may paralyse and traumatize individuals and communities. The application of Giddens' ‘ontological security’ to urban disaster foregrounds the importance for the disaster-affected population of regaining a sense of continuity and trust in the living and regulatory environment. Retaining (cultural) memory, also mediated through the arts, supports long-term rehabilitation. In the case under scrutiny, the municipal government indeed proved responsive to a desire to preserve disaster memory rather than just look ahead, yet unresolved forensic puzzles and lack of accountability may have slowed psychological closure. © 2021 The Author(s)",Warner J.,12139952400;,Enschede cries – Restoring ontological security after a fireworks disaster,2021,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,59,,102171,,,NA,4,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102171,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103791526&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijdrr.2021.102171&partnerID=40&md5=c4cbd66e8c01181cf32e4be5fe9da1fd,"Social Sciences Group, Wageningen University, Netherlands","Warner, J., Social Sciences Group, Wageningen University, Netherlands",Cultural memory; Emotional turn in disaster studies; Enschede; Fireworks disaster; Ontological security; The Netherlands,,,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85103900210,"Rationale: This study aimed to develop methods to determine the identity and trace the origin of propellants used in shotshells. Specifically, the use of organic component and stable isotope analysis techniques, such as bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA) and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) techniques, for the study of shotshell propellants was investigated. Methods: Nine samples of shotshell propellants from different manufacturing countries and brands were analyzed for explosive and additive components by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography. BSIA of the propellants was achieved using elemental analysis/isotope ratio mass spectrometry without a pretreatment process. For the CSIA of nitroglycerin, double-base powder propellants were extracted with ether, and the isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Results: Nine samples drawn from seven brands in four countries were classified into five groups by organic component analysis, while eight classification groups were identified by BSIA. Thus, two samples could not be distinguished from each other by either BSIA or organic component analysis. Subsequently, with the use of results obtained with CSIA for nitroglycerin, all the samples could be classified into different groups. These findings suggest that the nine propellant samples were all composed of different ingredients or raw materials from different sources. Conclusions: Stable isotope ratio analyses were performed for propellant discrimination. The combined BSIA, CSIA and organic component analysis techniques were able to successfully distinguish the nine shotshell propellants from seven brands sourced from four different countries, and the results suggested that the samples contained different ingredients or raw materials from different sources. We therefore can conclude that reliable results can be obtained using combined isotope analysis methods such as CSIA and BSIA for origin tracing and identity determination. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Kim N.Y., Song B.-Y., Kim D.-H., Jung M.-J.",57200313920;55415779100;57222733259;57200313372;,Preliminary stable isotope analyses for propellant discrimination in shotshells,2021,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,35,9,e9072,,,NA,3,10.1002/rcm.9072,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103900210&doi=10.1002%2frcm.9072&partnerID=40&md5=0aacc7123abfb68ebd9bf7e60cd90eff,"National Forensic Service, Gwangju InstituteJeonnam  57248, South Korea; Forensic Chemistry Division, National Forensic Service, Wonju, 26460, South Korea; Forensic Physical Division, National Forensic Service, Wonju, 26460, South Korea; Graduate School of Analytical Science & Technology, Daejeon, 34134, South Korea","Kim, N.Y., National Forensic Service, Gwangju InstituteJeonnam  57248, South Korea; Song, B.-Y., Forensic Chemistry Division, National Forensic Service, Wonju, 26460, South Korea; Kim, D.-H., Forensic Physical Division, National Forensic Service, Wonju, 26460, South Korea; Jung, M.-J., Graduate School of Analytical Science & Technology, Daejeon, 34134, South Korea",,Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; Propellants; Thin layer chromatography; Classifieds; Component analysis; Compound specific isotope analysis; Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry; Isotope analysis technique; Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry; Organic components; Pretreatment process; Stable-isotope analysis; Thin-layer chromatography; Gas chromatography,"Kim, N.Y.; National Forensic Service, South Korea; email: nykim60@korea.kr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

A typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene (TPE) polymerizes into PTPE to increase the fluorescence intensity in the SAMs, and the phosphoric acid acts as the anchor group to form stable covalent bonds with the Al2O3 substrate. This design takes advantage of the high sensitivity and good stability of SAMs, and high fluorescence intensity, and “wire effect” of the conjugated polymers. The polymeric SAM sensors are prepared on the Al2O3 silicon wafer and testing paper. Both of them show good response speed, reversibility, selectivity, and sensitivity. The detection limits down to 0.07, 0.35, and 4.11 ppm for TNT, DNB, and NB, respectively, are achieved on the inorganic testing paper. Furthermore, due to the higher fluorescence intensity by interlacing and overlapping of fibers, the detection of the paper can be distinguished by naked eyes even with a low-power handheld UV lamp, which provides an experimental basis for the development of cheap and easy trace NAC explosive sensors. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Li M., Xie K., Wang G., Zheng J., Cao Y., Cheng X., Li Z., Wei F., Tu H., Tang J.",57193239413;26868316100;57213606185;57194511106;57223924031;57221782039;55869570100;57199734944;7102363501;12791614900;,An AIE-Active Ultrathin Polymeric Self-Assembled Monolayer Sensor for Trace Volatile Explosive Detection,2021,Macromolecular Rapid Communications,42,23,2100551,,,NA,7,10.1002/marc.202100551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117596323&doi=10.1002%2fmarc.202100551&partnerID=40&md5=040807f13de0cd64311410d7c9e16726,"Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, 730070, China; GRIMAT Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, Beijing, 101407, China; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials for Smart Sensing, General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, Beijing, 100088, China; College of Materials Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan  410082, China; State Key Laboratory of Synthetic Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong","Li, M., Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong; Xie, K., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, 730070, China; Wang, G., GRIMAT Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, Beijing, 101407, China, State Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials for Smart Sensing, General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, Beijing, 100088, China; Zheng, J., Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong; Cao, Y., Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong; Cheng, X., Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong; Li, Z., College of Materials Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan  410082, China; Wei, F., GRIMAT Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, Beijing, 101407, China, State Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials for Smart Sensing, General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, Beijing, 100088, China; Tu, H., GRIMAT Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, Beijing, 101407, China, State Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials for Smart Sensing, General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, Beijing, 100088, China; Tang, J., Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong, State Key Laboratory of Synthetic Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong999077, Hong Kong",aggregation-induced emission; explosive detection; fluorescence quenching; naked eye detection; polymeric self-assembled monolayers,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Aromatic compounds; Conjugated polymers; Explosives; Eye protection; Fluorescence quenching; Self assembled monolayers; Silicon wafers; Aggregation-induced emissions; Compound explosives; Explosive Detection; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence quenching; Naked-eye detection; Nitroaromatic compound; Polymeric self-assembled monolayer; Tetraphenylethene; Ultra-thin; Explosives detection; explosive; polymer; fluorescence; Explosive Agents; Fluorescence; Polymers,"Tang, J.; Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong; email: jinyao@hku.hk

2-s2.0-85111919156,"Computer vision (CV) algorithms are widely utilized in imaging processing for medical and personal electronics applications. In sensorics CV can provide a great potential to quantitate chemosensors' signals. Here we wish to describe a method for the CV-assisted spectrofluorometer-free detection of common nitro-explosive components,e.g.2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), by using polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH, PAH = 1-pyrenyl or 9-anthracenyl) - basedbola-type chemosensors. The PAH components of these chemicalbolasare able to form stable, bright emissive in a visual wavelength region excimers, which allows their use as extended matrices of the RGB colors after imaging and digital processing. In non-polar solvents, the excimers have poor chemosensing properties, while in aqueous solutions, due to the possible micellar formation, these excimers provide “turn-off” fluorescence detection of DNT and TNT in the sub-nanomolar concentrations. A combination of these PAH-based fluorescent chemosensors with the proposed CV-assisted algorithm offers a fast and convenient approach for on-site, real-time, multi-thread analyte detection without the use of fluorometers. Although we focus on the analysis of nitro-explosives, the presented method is a conceptual work describing a general use of CV for quantitative fluorescence detection of various analytes as a simpler alternative to spectrofluorometer-assisted methods. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Kovalev I.S., Sadieva L.K., Taniya O.S., Yurk V.M., Minin A.S., Santra S., Zyryanov G.V., Charushin V.N., Chupakhin O.N., Tsurkan M.V.",7102090085;57196004979;56540003300;57191333160;56845134300;42462292700;6701496404;7006350819;7006259116;9746053000;,Computer visionvs.spectrofluorometer-assisted detection of common nitro-explosive components withbola-type PAH-based chemosensors,2021,RSC Advances,11,42,,25850,25857,NA,5,10.1039/d1ra03108b,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111919156&doi=10.1039%2fd1ra03108b&partnerID=40&md5=ab1890a275bb378af8bddb77eea14436,"Ural Federal University named after the first President of Russia B.

2-s2.0-85101054579,"The TNT-RDX-Al Explosive is an aluminum-containing mixed explosive often used in civil and military equipment, but the decomposition mechanism has not been theoretically studied. In this paper, the reaction force field containing C/H/O/N/Al parameters was used to simulate the thermal decomposition of the TNT-RDX-Al Explosive by reaction kinetics simulation. And the results were compared with the thermal decomposition behaviors of the binary systems TNT/AlO RDX/AlO and TNT/RDX. The partially passivated nano-aluminum particles were constructed and then mixed with TNT supercell, RDX supercell, and the constructed TNT/RDX supercell. The obtained mixed systems were then heated to a high temperature, where the explosive was completely decomposed. The decomposition process of the TNT-RDX-Al Explosive can be divided into several stages: the adsorption of aluminum atoms on TNT molecules and RDX molecules, the diffusion of O atoms into nano aluminum particles, the decomposition of TNT molecules and RDX molecules, the diffusion of C, H, N atoms into the nano aluminum particles, the Al atoms in the center of the aluminum sphere diffuse outward, and the final stage is the formation of the final product. The results show that the aluminum nanoparticles in the ternary system are easier to diffuse and spreads more widely. The addition of RDX molecules advances the time to complete decomposition of TNT molecules, and promotes the time when TNT molecules is completely decomposed to be closer to the time when RDX molecules is completely decomposed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Meng J., Wang C., Cheng M., Zhang S., Gou R., Chen Y., Li Y.",57218585840;55674523700;57222031466;8963475600;6602406349;21933492200;57246772600;,The thermal decomposition behavior of the TNT-RDX-Al explosive by molecular kinetic simulation,2021,International Journal of Quantum Chemistry,121,11,e26635,,,NA,6,10.1002/qua.26635,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101054579&doi=10.1002%2fqua.26635&partnerID=40&md5=0179b7bc4ff497d320ac784403f379dc,"School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China; Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle, Beijing, China; New Technology Applications Institute of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, China","Meng, J., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China; Wang, C., Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle, Beijing, China; Cheng, M., New Technology Applications Institute of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, China; Zhang, S., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China; Gou, R., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China; Chen, Y., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China; Li, Y., School of Environment and Safety Engineering, North, University of China, Taiyuan, China",aluminum nano particle; clusters; thermal decomposition; TNT-RDX-Al explosive,Aluminum; Aluminum powder metallurgy; Atoms; Explosives; Molecules; Reaction kinetics; Thermolysis; Aluminum nanoparticles; Decomposition mechanism; Decomposition process; High temperature; Kinetics simulations; Molecular kinetics; Reaction forces; Thermal decomposition behavior; Decomposition,"Zhang, S.; School of Environment and Safety Engineering, China; email: zsh93y@nuc.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85103400822,"Rapid and onsite detection of nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is very crucial for the safety and security of human life as well as for the environment. In this present work, we demonstrate the feasibility for employing Folic Acid (FA) as a fluorescent as well as a colorimetric probe for the detection of TNT. This probe was synthesized by a simple one-step process. The developed probe shows an emission maximum at 490 nm upon excitation at 420 nm. On adding TNT, the fluorescence of the FA probe is quenched. Also, it shows a good selectivity towards TNT over other similar organic compounds such as 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) and picric acid (PA). The limit of detection (LoD) of TNT was found to be 1.9398 µM. Colorimetric detection was conducted and paper strip assay was developed for the practical applications.

2-s2.0-85119523138,"Introduction: Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) personnel who practice breaching with blast exposure are at risk for blast-related head trauma. We aimed to investigate the impact of low-level blast exposure on underlying white matter (WM) microstructure based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) in SWAT personnel before and after breacher training. Diffusion tensor imaging is an advanced MRI technique sensitive to underlying WM alterations. NODDI is a novel MRI technique emerged recently that acquires diffusion weighted data from multiple shells modeling for different compartments in the microstructural environment in the brain. We also aimed to evaluate the effect of a jugular vein compression collar device in mitigating the alteration of the diffusion properties in the WM as well as its role as a moderator on the association between the diffusion property changes and the blast exposure. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one SWAT personnel (10 non-collar and 11 collar) completed the breacher training and underwent MRI at both baseline and after blast exposure. Diffusion weighted data were acquired with two shells (b = 1,000, 2,000 s/mm2) on 3T Phillips scanners. Diffusion tensor imaging metrices, including fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, and NODDI metrics, including neurite density index (NDI), isotropic volume fraction (fiso), and orientation dispersion index, were calculated. Tract-based spatial statistics was used in the voxel-wise statistical analysis. Post hoc analyses were performed for the quantification of the pre- to post-blast exposure diffusion percentage change in the WM regions with significant group difference and for the assessment of the interaction of the relationship between blast exposure and diffusion alteration. Results: The non-collar group exhibited significant pre- to post-blast increase in NDI (corrected P <. 05) in the WM involving the right internal capsule, the right posterior corona radiation, the right posterior thalamic radiation, and the right sagittal stratum. A subset of these regions showed significantly greater alteration in NDI and fiso in the non-collar group when compared with those in the collar group (corrected P <. 05). In addition, collar wearing exhibited a significant moderating effect for the alteration of fiso for its association with average peak pulse pressure. Conclusions: Our data provided initial evidence of the impact of blast exposure on WM diffusion alteration based on both DTI and NODDI. The mitigating effect of WM diffusivity changes and the moderating effect of collar wearing suggest that the device may serve as a promising solution to protect WM against blast exposure.  © 2021.","Yuan W., Dudley J., Slutsky-Ganesh A.B., Leach J., Scheifele P., Altaye M., Barber Foss K.D., Diekfuss J.D., Rhea C.K., Myer G.D.",35305992600;55737270100;57219537139;56823049500;6507666838;6603241667;6507308390;56784267000;12240642400;6701852696;,White Matter Alteration following SWAT Explosive Breaching Training and the Moderating Effect of a Neck Collar Device: A DTI and NODDI Study,2021,Military Medicine,186,11-Dec,,1183,1190,NA,3,10.1093/milmed/usab168,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119523138&doi=10.1093%2fmilmed%2fusab168&partnerID=40&md5=b616bdd8c61fd56ffbaf91a20f55b4b4,"Pediatric Neuroimaging Research Consortium, Division of Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States; Department of Kinesiology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC  27412, United States; Department of Radiology, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45267, United States; Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Cincinnati, College of Allied Health Sciences, Cincinnati, OH  45219, United States; Department of Medical Education, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45219, United States; Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States; Emory Sports Performance and Research Center, Flowery Branch, GA  30542, United States; Department of Orthopaedics, Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA  30322, United States; Emory Sports Medicine Center, Atlanta, GA  30329, United States; Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention, Waltham, MA  02453, United States","Yuan, W., Pediatric Neuroimaging Research Consortium, Division of Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States, Department of Radiology, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45267, United States; Dudley, J., Pediatric Neuroimaging Research Consortium, Division of Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States; Slutsky-Ganesh, A.B., Department of Kinesiology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC  27412, United States; Leach, J., Department of Radiology, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45267, United States; Scheifele, P., Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Cincinnati, College of Allied Health Sciences, Cincinnati, OH  45219, United States, Department of Medical Education, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45219, United States; Altaye, M., Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH  45229, United States; Barber Foss, K.D., Emory Sports Performance and Research Center, Flowery Branch, GA  30542, United States; Diekfuss, J.D., Emory Sports Performance and Research Center, Flowery Branch, GA  30542, United States, Department of Orthopaedics, Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA  30322, United States; Rhea, C.K., Department of Kinesiology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC  27412, United States; Myer, G.D., Emory Sports Performance and Research Center, Flowery Branch, GA  30542, United States, Department of Orthopaedics, Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA  30322, United States, Emory Sports Medicine Center, Atlanta, GA  30329, United States, Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention, Waltham, MA  02453, United States",,article; capsula interna; compression; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; human; jugular vein; neurite; post hoc analysis; pulse pressure; radial diffusivity; thalamocortical tract; weapon; brain; diagnostic imaging; white matter; explosive; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Explosive Agents; Humans; Neurites; White Matter,,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The fluorescence light signal was quenched as MF resin, and was subjected to ammonium nitrate (the most common industrial explosive material). These novel optical properties could be ascribed to wired series of π bonds, and lone pairs of an electron, along the macromolecule chain.

2-s2.0-85101869378,"Polydopamine surface coating shows the capability to improve the adhesive properties as well as mechanical stabilities of energetic materials, which is highly desired for the development of insensitive munitions. However, the slow polymerization process of dopamine makes the coating process time-consuming and uneconomic. Herein, an oxidant-accelerated strategy was demonstrated to obtain fast polymerization kinetics of dopamine for the surface modification of HMX crystals. Upon the addition of oxidant, PDA was able to form surface layer of HMX particles within 5 min without changing the shape and polymorph of HMX crystals. The PDA coating showed the ability to improve the wettability of HMX, contributing to its abundant active groups. Moreover, the mechanical stability of PDA on HMX (HMX@PDA) samples was improved accompany with the increasing coating time, and the friction explosion probability and drop height of 300 s treated sample were 40 % and 64 cm, respectively. The detonation velocity was also measured, which showed that the effect of PDA coating on the detonation velocity of HMX was not significant. More importantly, our protocol showed the capability to fabricate HMX@PDA with different particle sizes on a large scale, satisfying the application demands of insensitive high explosives. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Duan S., Wang D., Jiang Q., Xiao C., Liu H., Guo Y., Li S., Zhu Q.",57193498607;57209502398;57192704039;57190401846;57191582230;57190177169;12141531700;57190406414;,Oxidant-Accelerated Polydopamine Modification Process for the Fast Fabrication of PDA on HMX with Improved Mechanical Stability,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,5,,751,757,NA,6,10.1002/prep.202000095,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101869378&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000095&partnerID=40&md5=d40ec1c1d3f723d5129520d6610ceff8,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China","Duan, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Wang, D., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Jiang, Q., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Xiao, C., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Liu, H., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Guo, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Li, S., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China; Zhu, Q., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan  621999, China",Fast kinetics; HMX particle; Insensitive; Large-scale fabrication; PDA coating,Adhesives; Amines; Coatings; Crystals; Detonation; Fabrication; Neurophysiology; Oxidants; Polymerization; Adhesive properties; Different particle sizes; Explosion probability; Fast polymerization; Insensitive high explosive; Insensitive munitions; Modification process; Polymerization process; Mechanical stability,"Li, S.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: caeplisb@163.com

Fine AP was prepared by this freeze-drying method. In this study, the emulsion was prepared with the premixer adopted dual-sonic technology and an attempt was made to prepare finer AP. By using a dual-sonic premixer, the emulsion was efficiently prepared, and therefore, a fine AP sample was obtained, compared with the homogenizer that is commonly used.

2-s2.0-85122917139,"Empirical studies evaluating the conditions under which the transfer of forensic materials occurs can provide contextual information and offer insight into how that material may have been transferred in a given scenario. Here, a reductionist approach was taken to assess the impact of force, time, and rotation on the transfer of an explosive compound. An Instron ElectroPuls E3000 material testing instrument was used to bring porous and non-porous surfaces adulterated with an ammonium nitrate into direct contact with a human skin analogue, controlling for the force of contact, duration of contact, and rotation applied during contact. Quantifiable amounts of ammonium nitrate were recovered from all of the recipient surfaces demonstrating that ammonium nitrate is readily transferred from one surface to another, even when contact occurs for a short duration with a relatively low force. More particulates were transferred from non-porous surfaces onto the human skin analogue, but the amount of ammonium nitrate transferred did not depend upon the force of contact, duration of contact, or the amount of rotation applied. However, when contact occurred and involved rotation, a greater transfer of ammonium nitrate was observed, compared to those contacts occurring without rotation being applied. This approach complements more commonly-used holistic experiments that test multiple interacting variables in a realistic setting by isolating these variables, allowing them to be examined individually. This can be utilised to better understand the individual impact that specific variables have on the transfer of trace evidence in relevant crime reconstruction contexts. © 2021 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","Amaral M.A., Hatten E., Gibson A.P., Morgan R.M.",57216917074;57197782784;57188584733;57194780985;,"The impact of force, time, and rotation on the transfer of ammonium nitrate: A reductionist approach to understanding evidence dynamics",2022,Science and Justice,62,2,,129,136,NA,2,10.1016/j.scijus.2021.12.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122917139&doi=10.1016%2fj.scijus.2021.12.006&partnerID=40&md5=e409a9d6c9da1b92063c6e0afdd1ce2d,"Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London, Central House, London, WC1E 0NN, United Kingdom","Amaral, M.A., Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Hatten, E., Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Gibson, A.P., Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London, Central House, London, WC1E 0NN, United Kingdom; Morgan, R.M., Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom",Crime reconstruction; Evidence dynamics; Experimental studies; Explosives; Forensic science; Instron ElectroPuls,ammonium nitrate; explosive; ammonium nitrate; nitric acid derivative; Article; contact time; controlled study; crime scene reconstruction; dynamics; force; forensic science; human; materials testing; rotation; simulation; surface area; surface property; time; torque; trace evidence (forensics); forensic medicine; rotation; Explosive Agents; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Nitrates; Rotation,"Amaral, M.A.; Department of Security and Crime Science, 35 Tavistock Square, United Kingdom; email: mark.amaral.14@ucl.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85106670072,"Porous silicon with sodium perchlorate oxidizer is hypothesized to be a detonable explosive, which is atypical for heterogenous fuel/oxidizer composites. The existence of detonation in energetic porous silicon remains contested and would theoretically feature several unique behaviors illustrated by this study. Calculations to predict detonation performance are performed using CHEETAH thermochemical code for silicon porosities of 45–85 % surrounding 69 %, which represents an experimentally typical case. Uniquely, e-PS detonation is predicted to produce low gas volume. At 69 % porosity, condensed detonation products comprise 78 % of the mass (varying from 86 % to 46 % for 45–85 % porosity), and therefore a low TNT equivalent mechanical energy of 0.429 (but 1.32 when comparing total detonation energy). The calculated pressure of detonation for 69 % porosity is 1.065 GPa, only about 4 % of that of typical military explosives but over 50 times greater than compression wave amplitudes estimated for fast-burning nanothermites, which are comparable heterogenous fuel/oxidizer composites. At porosities above 67 %, computed detonation velocities are shown to exceed estimates for the unreacted speed of sound and therefore a detonation structure consistent with classical CJ theory is proposed. Indeed, published maximum experimental propagation speeds for energetic porous silicon in this upper porosity range when pore size is optimal agree well with CHEETAH computations of detonation velocity, thereby supporting that detonation is possible. Below 66 % porosity, sound speed in unreacted material overtakes the calculated detonation velocities. Traditionally this precludes formation of a detonation wave since the shockwave would decay as energy propagates ahead acoustically into unreacted material. However, experimental agreement is still observed between 60–67 % porosity. By comparing computed detonation pressure with estimates for the strength of unreacted porous silicon, this range is proposed to be a transition zone in which a detonation-like structure could be maintained, despite the inverted sound speed comparison, by rapid catastrophic fracture of porous silicon at the detonation front. This hypothesis implies that a sonic precompression wave must precede the detonation wave since at least a minor fraction of shock energy would propagate ahead in unreacted material. Finally, comparisons are made with baseline primary explosives and nanothermites showing that among metal-based composite energetics on the basis of reaction rate and detonation pressure, energetic porous silicon currently exhibits the most promise for replacing primary explosives at reasonable densities in igniters and augmenting initiator formulations. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Guerieri P.M., Fuchs B., Churaman W.A.",56217392900;15131947300;24832738000;,Feasibility of Detonation in Porous Silicon Nanoenergetics,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,8,,1260,1275,NA,4,10.1002/prep.202000311,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106670072&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000311&partnerID=40&md5=0f859f9be01339f7579f3c1ca58a642e,"Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD  20783, United States; DEVCOM Armaments Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806, United States","Guerieri, P.M., Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD  20783, United States; Fuchs, B., DEVCOM Armaments Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806, United States; Churaman, W.A., Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD  20783, United States",Detonation; Energetic Materials; Initiation; Porous Silicon,Initiators (explosives); Inorganic compounds; Pore size; Porous silicon; Shock waves; Silicon compounds; Sodium compounds; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Catastrophic fracture; Detonation performance; Detonation pressure; Detonation structures; Detonation velocity; Mechanical energies; Military explosives; Sodium perchlorate; Detonation,"Guerieri, P.M.; Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate, United States; email: philip.m.guerieri.civ@mail.mil",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85100567382,"Modern polymer bonded explosives (PBX) are often characterized by a sensitive response to external thermomechanical insult that in some cases lead to accidental detonation. Current strategies for desensitizing PBXs come at the expense of a significant reduction in performance. A possible method for desensitizing PBX without adverse performance effects is the multifunctional tailoring of mechanical properties through strategic incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) directly into the binder phase. In this work, a fabrication method is presented that produces polymer bonded simulants (PBS) of PBX that incorporate MWCNTs into the binder phase, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). These materials were characterized via microscopy and unconfined quasi-static compression testing to determine the effects of MWCNTs. Quasi-static compression showed evidence of a MWCNT induced structural skeleton effect that provided the binder with an increased strength, load transfer, and a greater ability to resist strain localizations prior to failure. These enhancements demonstrate the potential of using MWCNTs to enhance energetic materials. © The Author(s) 2021.","Iglesias E.E., Rowe T., Fernandez K., Chocron S., Wilkerson J.",57220446344;55798508100;57209969405;55667311100;34979548800;,Mechanical response of carbon nanotube reinforced particulate composites with implications for polymer bonded explosives,2021,Journal of Composite Materials,55,19,,2577,2590,NA,4,10.1177/0021998321990863,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100567382&doi=10.1177%2f0021998321990863&partnerID=40&md5=327390996f2972bd2e557de34a4fb348,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, United States; Computational Mechanics Section, Engineering Dynamics Department, Southwest Research Institute, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas AM University, United States","Iglesias, E.E., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, United States; Rowe, T., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, United States; Fernandez, K., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, United States; Chocron, S., Computational Mechanics Section, Engineering Dynamics Department, Southwest Research Institute, United States; Wilkerson, J., Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas AM University, United States",nanocomposites; Particulate composites; shear band; softening; strain localization,Compression testing; Detonation; Nanotubes; Particle reinforced composites; Polybutadienes; Reinforcement; Hydroxyl terminated polybutadienes; Mechanical response; Particulate composites; Performance effect; Polymer bonded explosives; Quasi-static compression; Strain localizations; Structural skeletons; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN),"Wilkerson, J.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, United States; email: wilkerson@tamu.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Due to inherent nature of ingredients like aluminium metal powder, which has more combustible and the possibilities of dust explosion are merely high. Nowadays, the use of boron as a replacement of aluminium in firecracker mixtures is being researched upon. Hence, this paper aims at measuring the minimum ignition temperature (MIT) of existing and boron blended firework composition by using Godbert Greenwald furnace. Nowadays, many firework industries are employing automation. In such places, by limiting the level of oxygen supply with Nitrogen gas, the accidents can be avoided. Hence, the limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) is also measured.

Besides the developed method can be used for the analysis of gas mixtures (gases, vapors, natural, and thermal decomposition products) of various origins for many applications (biology, medicine, agricultural applications). © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Vaks V., Domracheva E., Chernyaeva M., Pripolzin S., Anfertev V., Yablokov A., Lukyanenko I., Sheikov Y.",7005400467;7003996334;8308388800;15064736600;56784351500;56784038700;57201802110;6504549177;,High-Resolution Terahertz Spectroscopy for Investigation of Energetic Materials during Their Thermal Decomposition,2021,IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology,11,4,9408427,443,453,NA,5,10.1109/TTHZ.2021.3074030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104571017&doi=10.1109%2fTTHZ.2021.3074030&partnerID=40&md5=a5664b7a0f6ee9f816dabdc51056028e,"Institute for Physics of Microstructures, Russian Academy of Sciences, Nizhny Novgorod, 603087, Russian Federation; Lobachevsky State University, Nizhny Novgorod, 603950, Russian Federation; Russian Federal Nuclear Center VNIIEF, Sarov, 607188, Russian Federation; Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University N.a.

2-s2.0-85124029719,"Biological detection is leveraged within the fields of security screening and criminal investigations. Military and law enforcement personnel utilize canine teams in a range of different applications to detect explosives and narcotics. Due to the ever-changing materials encountered during routine field operations, it is imperative to have an optimal training regimen reflective of current target odor needs. Hence, the chemical understanding of target odor concentrations and subsequent means of odor delivery are essential in canine team training. Using double base smokeless powder as the target odor, this study evaluates the feasibility of presenting an explosive odor using an olfactometer. Furthermore, this study bridges instrumental validation for confirmation and understanding of odor chemical composition as well as persistence of odor over time. Instrumental parameter optimization included analysis of optimal solid phase microextraction fiber chemistry of target odor as a function of peak area response using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Studies were conducted directly over the headspace of the target odor and using the olfactometer as the dynamic airflow device for comparison purposes. Previously established volatile organic compounds from smokeless powders were detected, and comparison between non-airflow vs. airflow sampling was achieved. Results indicate a polyacrylate (PA) SPME fiber is optimal for specific detection of diphenylamine when subjected to dynamic airflow. Furthermore, sampling of “blank” trials following an odor trial indicated no residual contamination via instrumental verification. Persistence of odor volatile over a nine-week period of active olfactometer sampling showed decrease concentration, thus the need for consistent monitoring for optimal canine use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Gallegos S.F., Aviles-Rosa E.O., Hall N.J., Prada-Tiedemann P.A.",57394126500;57209716523;48361546800;8863257700;,Headspace sampling of smokeless powder odor in a dynamic airflow context,2022,Forensic Chemistry,27,,100402,,,NA,2,10.1016/j.forc.2022.100402,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124029719&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2022.100402&partnerID=40&md5=3fb436a0aeca48b4f0726ad706d4fcf5,"Forensic Analytical Chemistry and Odor Profiling Laboratory, Department of Environmental Toxicology, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States; Department of Animal & Food Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States","Gallegos, S.F., Forensic Analytical Chemistry and Odor Profiling Laboratory, Department of Environmental Toxicology, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States; Aviles-Rosa, E.O., Department of Animal & Food Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States; Hall, N.J., Department of Animal & Food Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States; Prada-Tiedemann, P.A., Forensic Analytical Chemistry and Odor Profiling Laboratory, Department of Environmental Toxicology, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States",Biological detection; Dynamic airflow; Odor delivery; Olfactometer; Smokeless powder,,"Prada-Tiedemann, P.A.; Texas Tech University, 1207 S.

2-s2.0-85113187678,"Rapid screening for chemical traces of explosives and narcotics is widely used to support homeland security and law enforcement. These target compounds span a range of physicochemical properties from organic to inorganic, with preferential ionization pathways in both negative and positive mode operation. Nonvolatile inorganic oxidizers present in homemade fuel-oxidizer mixtures, pyrotechnics, and propellants create a unique challenge to traditional thermal desorption-based technologies. Developments in solid-liquid extraction techniques, specifically, open port sampling interface mass spectrometry (OPSI-MS) provide compelling capabilities to address these hurdles. In this proof of concept study, we investigated the trace detection of wipe-based (i.e., common swipe sampling collection method) explosives, oxidizers, and narcotics using an OPSI source and compact single quadrupole mass analyzer. The liquid dissolution and extraction capabilities of OPSI enabled detection of both traditional military-grade explosives and homemade explosive oxidizers. OPSI-MS sensitivities to a series of seven target compounds from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated fiberglass sampling wipes were on the order of several nanograms to sub-nanogram levels. Comparisons with direct solution-based sample analysis enabled quantification of wipe-based sample extraction effects. The system demonstrated quick temporal responses, polarity switching capabilities, and rapid signal decay with minimal carryover, all critical to high throughput screening applications. Coupling traditional swipe sampling with OPSI-MS offers a promising tool for contraband screening applications.

2-s2.0-85108083779,"Aluminum nanoparticles (ANP) are important components of modern energetic systems because of their excellent combustion performance. However, the underlying mechanism of ANP in energetic materials during ignition is unclear. Based on the ReaxFF-lg method, the oxidation mechanism of ANP in pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) was analyzed from an atomic perspective, and the evolution of ANP from single and multi-particle models during ignition were studied. Adding ANP increases the heat release and accelerates the decomposition of PETN. ANP inhibits CO2 emissions and increases H2O yields. Both particle size and passivated layer influence the oxidation mechanisms due to different surface effects. The oxidation mechanism of smaller ANP is dominated by Al atom diffusion, but the larger ANP involves O inward diffusion and Al outward diffusion at both solid and melting states. An important behavior of chained C/Al clusters accumulation was observed during the later combustion, which agrees with the earlier experiments. The lattice diffusion aggregation of ANP and the aggregations of O/Al and C/Al cluster were revealed during the reaction. The calculated temperature distribution revealed that the hot spots in aluminized PETN originate from the oxidation heat release of ANP.

2-s2.0-85114315262,"Legacy landmines in post-conflict areas are a non-discriminatory lethal hazard and can still be triggered decades after the conflict has ended. Efforts to detect these explosive devices are expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to humans and animals involved. While methods such as metal detectors and sniffer dogs have successfully been used in humanitarian demining, more tools are required for both site surveying and accurate mine detection. Honeybees have emerged in recent years as efficient bioaccumulation and biomonitoring animals. The system reported here uses two complementary landmine detection methods: passive sampling and active search. Passive sampling aims to confirm the presence of explosive materials in a mine-suspected area by the analysis of explosive material brought back to the colony on honeybee bodies returning from foraging trips. Analysis is performed by light-emitting chemical sensors detecting explosives thermally desorbed from a preconcentrator strip. The active search is intended to be able to pinpoint the place where individual landmines are most likely to be present. Used together, both methods are anticipated to be useful in an end-to-end process for area surveying, suspected hazardous area reduction, and post-clearing internal and external quality control in humanitarian demining. © 2021","Filipi J., Stojnić V., Muštra M., Gillanders R.N., Jovanović V., Gajić S., Turnbull G.A., Babić Z., Kezić N., Risojević V.",34881750400;57203204694;24766632600;7801607656;57188676356;57205643994;7102941540;8597226400;6602790561;6504241952;,Honeybee-based biohybrid system for landmine detection,2022,Science of the Total Environment,803,,150041,,,NA,4,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114315262&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.150041&partnerID=40&md5=6db19b56ee32f9a2ac78d46cca2ac7ee,"Department of Ecology, Agronomy and Aquaculture, University of Zadar, Trg Kneza Višeslava 9, Zadar, 23000, Croatia; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka, Patre 5, Banja Luka, 78000, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences, University of Zagreb, Vukelićeva 4, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia; Organic Semiconductor Centre, SUPA, School of Physics & Astronomy, University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland  KY16 9SS, United Kingdom; Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, SvetoÅ¡imunska Cesta 25, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia","Filipi, J., Department of Ecology, Agronomy and Aquaculture, University of Zadar, Trg Kneza Višeslava 9, Zadar, 23000, Croatia; Stojnić, V., Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka, Patre 5, Banja Luka, 78000, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Muštra, M., Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences, University of Zagreb, Vukelićeva 4, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia; Gillanders, R.N., Organic Semiconductor Centre, SUPA, School of Physics & Astronomy, University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland  KY16 9SS, United Kingdom; Jovanović, V., Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, SvetoÅ¡imunska Cesta 25, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia; Gajić, S., Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka, Patre 5, Banja Luka, 78000, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Turnbull, G.A., Organic Semiconductor Centre, SUPA, School of Physics & Astronomy, University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland  KY16 9SS, United Kingdom; Babić, Z., Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka, Patre 5, Banja Luka, 78000, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Kezić, N., Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, SvetoÅ¡imunska Cesta 25, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia; Risojević, V., Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka, Patre 5, Banja Luka, 78000, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Convolutional neural networks; Humanitarian demining; Organic semiconductors; REST sampling; Unmanned aerial vehicles,Animals; Biochemistry; Landmine detection; Neural networks; Quality control; Sampling; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Active searches; Aerial vehicle; Bio-hybrid systems; Convolutional neural network; Explosive materials; Humanitarian demining; Land mine; Organics; Passive sampling; REST sampling; Explosives; accuracy assessment; aerial survey; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; detection method; developing world; hazard assessment; hazard management; humanitarian aid; landmine; surveying; unmanned vehicle; Article; computer vision; controlled study; detection dog; foraging; honeybee; human; information processing; landmine; nonhuman; plume; quality control; unmanned aerial vehicle; videorecording; animal; bee; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; dog; questionnaire; specimen handling; Apis mellifera; explosive; Animals; Bees; Bioaccumulation; Biological Monitoring; Dogs; Explosive Agents; Specimen Handling; Surveys and Questionnaires,"Risojević, V.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Patre 5, Bosnia and Herzegovina; email: vladimir.risojevic@etf.unibl.org",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85118941782,"The prediction of the brisance performance of the aluminized explosive detonation, which involves complicated multiphase and multiphysics flow, is a difficult problem to tackle. In this paper, the detonation and brisance performance of aluminized HMX explosives is investigated using the density-adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics methodology. The ignition and growth model was incorporated in smoothed particle hydrodynamics to calculate the pressure generated by the detonation of aluminized explosive, and the after-burning combustion model was used to obtain the released energy caused by the combustion of aluminium particles. The elastic-perfectly plastic model and Tillotson equation of state were employed to predict the dynamic behavior of metal material. In addition, the density-adaptive method is employed to deal with the multiphase interface with a large density ratio. Firstly, the equations of state and constitutive models are verified by two benchmark cases, namely three-dimensional detonation of PBX 9501 explosive and three-dimensional aluminium-aluminium high-velocity impact. Subsequently, the detonation velocity and peak pressure of aluminized HMX with different mass fractions of aluminium powder are investigated. In the end, the interaction between the steel confiner and the detonation of aluminized explosive is conducted in order to study the brisance performance of aluminized explosive.

2-s2.0-85122778984,"Liquid chromatography (LC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) are powerful separation techniques for forensic science in the analysis of drugs, toxicology samples, trace evidence, and explosives. Combining LC and SFC with diode array detectors (DAD) can provide detection at a single wavelength or generate complete UV spectra. This advantageous pairing within forensic science allows distinguishing between classes and subclasses of compounds, discriminating positional isomers with benzene substitutions, and using library database comparison to enhance certainty of compound identification through statistical comparison. Additionally, employing DAD at single wavelengths and generation of UV spectra allow quantitation with excellent linearity, good linear range, and satisfactory limits of detection. Important for quantitation, the generation of UV spectra allows confirmation of compound identity and peak purity. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the qualitative and quantitative uses of LC, and SFC paired with scanning DAD within forensic science over the last ten years (2010–2020), including the analysis of seized drugs, toxicology samples, explosives, inks, and dyes.

Many studies have explored different supporting structures for RDX; however, the use of natural materials have rarely has been reported. Natural cellulose is widely known for its excellent compatibility and loading capacity. In this study, cellulose was used as a supporting structure and insensitive material for RDX composites. Cellulose/RDX composite aerogels (RCAs) were prepared using 1-allyl-3-methyl imidazole (AMIMCl) as the solvent, and their properties were characterized. The results show that the content of nitrogen in cellulose/RCAs was 34.5%, and the content of RDX was as high as 94.3%. Moreover, RDX particles were attached to the fibers inside the cellulose aerogels (CAs), forming a homogeneous protective layer on the surface of the cellulose matrix. Compared with the raw RDX material, the thermal stability of the cellulose/RDX energetic aerogels was greatly increased. The porosity of the CAs was reduced due to RDX particles growing inside the CAs.

This research examined canine detection proficiency to odor mixtures and the use of mixture training to improve said proficiency. Trained detection canines were tested on their ability to correctly locate their trained target odors, explosives or narcotics, in various mixtures from a series of blanks and distractor odors. After making base measurements, canines were trained on the target odor in mixtures using the Mixed Odor Delivery Device (MODD), which was previously developed to safely contain separated explosive components and deliver the mixed odor to a canine detector for training purposes. Headspace measurements, made using solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS), were also taken of mixture components in and out of the MODD to confirm that odor mixtures were accurately portrayed to the canines during MODD training. Following mixture training, canines were retested on the same mixtures. Results of the headspace analysis showed that the MODD did not alter the delivery of the odorants from the mixture components. As such, canines showed an improved proficiency in detection of target mixtures following mixture training, increasing the detection rate from 63% to 72% for pseudo cocaine mixtures and from 19% to 100% for explosive mixtures. © 2021","DeGreeff L.E., Peranich K.",36992911500;57193528459;,Canine olfactory detection of trained explosive and narcotic odors in mixtures using a Mixed Odor Delivery Device,2021,Forensic Science International,329,,111059,,,NA,6,10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.111059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117746942&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2021.111059&partnerID=40&md5=a9fd79bb07bdd6ae16a2460180dd1c60,"Formerly of the US Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6181, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C., 20375, United States; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, 3767 Strauss Ave #113, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States","DeGreeff, L.E., Formerly of the US Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6181, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C., 20375, United States; Peranich, K., Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, 3767 Strauss Ave #113, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States",Canine olfaction detection; Explosives detection; Headspace analysis; Narcotics detection; SPME-GC/MS,ammonium nitrate; cocaine; explosive; fragrance; narcotic agent; Article; bomb; Canis; chemical analysis; chromatography; comparative study; controlled study; mass fragmentography; narcotic odor; nonhuman; odor; olfactory receptor; olfactory system; process optimization; solid phase microextraction; trained explosive odor; animal; dog; odor; Animals; Dogs; Explosive Agents; Narcotics; Odorants; Smell; Solid Phase Microextraction,"Peranich, K.; Naval Surface Warfare Center, 3767 Strauss Ave #113, United States; email: kimberly.peranich@navy.mil",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Four parameters including the rate of cooling, mixing patterns, agitator speed, and surfactant were considered in cooling crystallization of ammonium perchlorate. Nine tests were carried out based on the Taguchi experimental design method. The morphology of the obtained crystals was analyzed by optical microscope and MIP 4 student software. The size distribution of the particles was modeled using the Rosin-Rammler method.

2-s2.0-85092364607,"The stability and performance of nitrate ester-based energetic materials may be compromised by their degradation, which is primarily promoted by the NOx. To overcome this issue, the typical approach is the addition of stabilizers to the original formulation of the energetic materials. However, this is not always suitable, particularly if pure materials are needed. Thus, this work presents a new method consisting of capturing the released NOx on activated carbons impregnated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The principle is to perform the oxidation of NOx to HNO3 by photocatalysis in presence of TiO2. Consequently, four different activated carbons are prepared by chemical activation with ZnCl2 and H3PO4 to achieve diverse textural and functional properties. They are subjected to impregnation with 1 wt. % of TiO2. Hence, they are thoroughly characterized by means of nitrogen sorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. Afterwards, their efficiency under different light conditions is assessed through the capture of NOx evolved from the accelerated degradation of nitrocellulose quantified by Bergmann-Junk test. The quantity of captured NOx is determined by ion chromatography. The results show that a combination of a micro and mesoporous material with low surface functions is the optimal criterion to achieve the desired deposition rate of TiO2. This is obtained by the heat-treated activated carbon synthetized using H3PO4. In addition, more than 60% of the released NOx are efficiently captured by the prepared materials under ultraviolet light, corresponding to 0.0723 mmol of NOx per gram of impregnated activated carbon. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bouriche R., Tazibet S., Boutillara Y., Melouki R., Benaliouche F., Boucheffa Y.",57219361443;55555746500;56888768900;57190003522;15724457000;6602393038;,Characterization of Titanium (IV) Oxide Nanoparticles Loaded onto Activated Carbon for the Adsorption of Nitrogen Oxides Produced from the Degradation of Nitrocellulose,2021,Analytical Letters,54,12,,1929,1942,NA,5,10.1080/00032719.2020.1829637,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092364607&doi=10.1080%2f00032719.2020.1829637&partnerID=40&md5=db991d479c398ae0d3cb508c027948e0,"Institut National de Criminologie et de Criminalistique, Bouchaoui, Algiers, Algeria; Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Laboratoire d’Etude Physico-chimique des Matériaux et Application à l’Environnement, Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene, Algeria El‑Alia, Bab‑Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria","Bouriche, R., Institut National de Criminologie et de Criminalistique, Bouchaoui, Algiers, Algeria, Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Tazibet, S., Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Boutillara, Y., Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Melouki, R., Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Benaliouche, F., Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria; Boucheffa, Y., Laboratoire d’Etude Physico-chimique des Matériaux et Application à l’Environnement, Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene, Algeria El‑Alia, Bab‑Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria",Activated carbons; Bergmann–Junk test; nitrocellulose; photocatalysis; TiO2,,"Boutillara, Y.; Unité d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Physico-chimie des Matériaux/Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, B.P 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algeria",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85099502337,"Detonators are explosive devices used for the initiation of secondary explosives in commercial and military applications. They are characterized by their initiating capability, which is a critical factor for their safe and effective use but challenging to assess accurately. In this two-part study, we employ numerical simulations to investigate the blast wave generated by detonators and examine their initiating capability. The first part, presented here, follows the European underwater test of initiating capability, which evaluates detonators in isolation (direct method) and the second part considers detonators placed within a receiving explosive charge (indirect method). In the underwater test, the detonator is ignited inside a water tank and the initiating capability is assessed through pressure measurements in the far field. We employ a multiphysics methodology that allows the use of distinct mathematical models for each component such as two-phase reactive materials, elastic-plastic solids, and inert fluids. The computational implementation is validated against underwater experiments and is employed for the simulation of the blast wave generated by different types of detonators. The initial focus is on the general characteristics of the blast wave and subsequently on the differences between detonators of different shell material and thickness. Results show that the blast wave in the near field is asymmetric and varies significantly between detonators, but these features do not persist in the far field. The underwater test considers only the far field and is thus unable to capture the near field differences, which have a significant impact on the initiation of secondary explosives. © 2021 Author(s).","Ioannou E., Nikiforakis N.",57197811173;6506052079;,Multiphysics modeling of the initiating capability of detonators.

2-s2.0-85109036572,"Improvised explosives can be, in most cases, prepared from relatively easily accessible matters. The preparation procedure is often simple and generally known, or the information can be looked up on the Internet. The spectrum of phases which can be met concerning these materials is extremely wide and until now no systematic attention has been paid to this fact. In the past years the attention of the Institute of Criminalistics and the University of Pardubice concentrated on preparation of selected groups of these matters, to experimental explosions and to analyses of primary phases and post blast residues using wide spectrum of analytical techniques. Last year the organic analysis was focused on the detection of amines. A simple and sensitive method for the determination of free aliphatic and aromatic amines using derivatives agents as a labelling reagent by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) has been developed. Derivatization conditions including reagent concentration, buffer pH, reaction time and temperature were optimized. A fluorescence derivatization-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, which enables the femtomole-level detection of analytes, is a powerful tool for the analysis with high sensitivity and selectivity. Inorganic microanalysis was concentrated on analysis of post-blast residues from experimental explosions of explosive pyrotechnical compositions based on potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and barium nitrate-fuel. All the information obtained is stored in a specialized software-database, which will be used by specialized security units.

2-s2.0-85089386273,"Rapid on-site detection of nitro-explosives (NEs) residues on surfaces is of great importance for security screening, especially at the public transit checkpoints. Past practices to recognize NEs generally rely on bulky and expensive instruments. Herein, the rapid on-site detection of 2,2′,4,4′,6,6′-hexanitrostilbene (HNS) on surfaces has been firstly reported together with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) via the naked eye-based visual method, in which a dual functional (sampling and sensing) cotton swab sensor was proposed. The flexible sensor (amino-swab) was prepared through a one-step soaking method. –NH2 was found to react with the NEs to form different amino-NEs complexes. Unlike TNT, there were two kinds of complexes in the amino-HNS system, and the reaction mechanism of that was explored for the first time. The above orange-like complexes could be identified by the naked eye. The lowest detectable amounts for HNS and TNT on the glass surface were ~89 and ~45 ng (contaminated area: ~1.76 cm2), respectively, while the whole analysis took less than 1 min. The sensor was successfully utilized for NEs detection on luggage and travel bag, suggesting good adaptability.

While terahertz spectroscopy is a sensitive tool that can be used to characterize its intermolecular forces. In this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is employed to investigate the polymorphic transformations of the explosive 2,2dinitroethylene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7) under a heating process. Solid-state density functional theory (DFT) uncovers the physical mechanisms that contribute to the polymorphic transformation. This is achieved by assessing the calculated spectra relative to the actual spectra from experiment. The results suggest that the THz spectral features that arise represent a redistribution of the intermolecular forces during the polymorphic transformations.

2-s2.0-85102959111,"Sampling hazardous compounds in the form of solids and liquids is a growing need in the fields of homeland security and forensics. Chemical analysis of particles and droplets under field conditions is crucial for various tasks carried out by counter-terrorism and law enforcement units. The use of simple, small and low cost means to achieve this goal is constantly pursued. In this work, an approach for rapid, continuous generation of vapors from liquid samples using sonic spray (SS) as the sample introduction technique, followed by analysis using hand-held ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) vapor analyzers is presented. Transfer of analytes is demonstrated from liquid state to the gas phase at the inlet of an IMS detector using a sonic spray apparatus that consists of a nebulizer, spraying solution, a source of compressed gas and an unheated transfer line tube to the detector inlet nozzle. This technique does not require any electrical, radiative or thermal energy. Analysis of several narcotic substances including cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine, and of an explosive compound, TNT, is demonstrated, using two commercial devices as analyzers. Two sampling configurations are presented: direct sampling of liquid, either from a vial or a spill (SS-IMS) and extraction of a substance collected with a swab by dipping it in the spray solvent (ESS-IMS), being suitable for both drops and particles. Limits of detection of the presented method are comparable to those obtained with thermal desorption sample introduction of the commercial device. Time traces of the IMS signals show a continuous and stable signal with a short rise time. This sampling technique may offer competitive performance to that of common thermal desorption techniques, with the advantages of coupling to simpler, smaller and cheaper vapor detectors, optimized for field use, and of a continuous, pulseless sample or object interrogation.

CL-20 is the only single compound having highest energy among all the organic substances. But polymorphic form α- of CL-20 is generally obtained during most of the synthetic processes which has low density and high sensitivity. Thus, there is requirement of further recrystallization to obtain most stable ϵ-polymorphic form. Owing to the highest density, superior thermal stability and better insensitivity of ϵ- polymorph over other three polymorphs (α-, β- and γ- form) which are highly sensitive towards impact, friction and shock, ϵ- CL-20 is most desirable for use in defence applications. The present work studies the effect of various variables which influence the crystallisation process like effect of moisture, nature of solvent/anti-solvent and time on the preparation of ϵ- form of CL-20. Ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate as solvents and toluene as anti-solvent resulted in the formation of desired ϵ- polymorphic form successfully.

Of particular interest is the possibility to estimate the velocity of metal liner driven by an explosive charge. We present a theoretical model for estimation of metal cylinder wall velocity profiles of non-ideal ANFO explosives. The model is based on thermochemical calculations using EXPLO5 code, expressing the Gurney energy in terms of JWL equation of state, and using hydro-code simulation. The Wood-Kirkwood detonation theory, incorporated in EXPLO5, is applied for calculation of detonation parameters of non-ideal ANFO explosives.

Explosives are electron deficient materials; the vicinity of explosives to fluorescent material can encounter electron migration. This study reports on facile synthesis of cerium (III)-melamine coordination polymer (CeM-CP) with exclusive optical properties. CeM-CP demonstrated novel spectral fluorescence properties over visible and infrared bands when stimulated with UVA LED source at 385 nm of 100 mW power. Stimulated CeM-CP demonstrated unique spectral fluorescence signal at 400, 700, and 785 nm. These fluorescent signals were correlated to cerium coordination with four nitrogen atoms; vacant orbital will be available for electron excitation migration. Spectral fluorescent signals were quenched as CeM-CP was subjected to TNT vapours. Hyperspectral imaging offered 3D plot of fluorescence signature. The main outcome is that complete fluorescence signal attenuation was achieved at 785 nm.

It is shown that, for ammonium nitrate in storage or in transport (as distinguished from manufacturing activities), there has been only one cause of explosions—uncontrolled fire. It is also identified that, given an uncontrolled fire impinging on a stock of ammonium nitrate, there is a 30% probability of explosion and a 15% probability of loss of life. These facts then clearly indicate that eliminating the potential for uncontrolled fires will eliminate the potential for explosion of ammonium nitrate in storage or in transport. It is shown that precluding the potential for fires is not difficult, given appropriate building construction and operating procedures.

2-s2.0-85091876021,"Aluminum (Al) powders are commonly used in improvised explosive devices as metallic fuels, a component of explosive mixtures. These powders can be obtained readily from industrial-scale and consumer products, and produced using unsophisticated “kitchen chemistry” techniques. This research demonstrates the potential of automated particle micromorphometry for comparisons between known source and questioned Al powders recovered from IEDs, as well as for insight into the method of Al powder manufacture. Al powder samples were obtained from legitimate manufacturers, and 56 samples were produced “in-house” from Al-containing spray paints and ball-milled Al foils. Transmitted light microscope images of Al powder particles were acquired using an automated stage with automated z-focus; 17 size and shape parameters were measured for all particles. Approximately 37,000–2,500,000 particles/sample were analyzed using an open-source statistical package with customized code. Dimensionality reduction was required for processing the large datasets: eight of the 17 measured variables were selected based on inspection of the correlation matrix. Data from four subsamples from each of the 56 samples produced using “in-house” methods were analyzed using ANOVA to assess the within- and between-sample variation. High within-sample variation was noted; however, ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) tests demonstrated that the between-sample variation was substantially larger than the within-sample variation. Each sample could be differentiated from all other samples in the test set. Future experiments will focus on ways to reduce the within-sample variation, and additional statistical and microanalytical methods to classify sources and confidently constrain the method of Al powder manufacture. © 2020 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

We developed two generations of this laser. The first generation has a high duty cycle and a tunable repetition rate. The second generation is optimized for maximum output power. We utilize these new lasers to measure ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra of many important chromophores that absorb in deep ultraviolet (UV). We demonstrate the utility of this excitation by measuring the 228-nm absolute differential Raman cross sections of explosives, peptides, aromatic amino acids, and DNA/RNA nucleotides. Deep UV excitation at 228 nm occurs within the π → π* electronic transitions of these molecules. The 228-nm resonance excitation enhances the Raman intensities of vibrations of NOx groups, peptide bonds, aromatic amino acid side chains, and DNA/RNA nucleotides. The measured 228-nm UVRR cross sections of these molecules are 103–104 fold greater than those excited in the visible spectral region.

Recycling or recovery of AP from demilitarization or outdated propellant items is a challenging task. Herein, we report the purchase of recycled crude AP from commercially, and then subsequently AP was purified through filtration with activated carbon and recrystallization. After recrystallization, the yield of AP was 85 %, and the resultant product was characterized by various techniques including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These results indicate that recrystallized AP had excellent purity and crystallinity compared to crude AP. In addition, purified AP was used as source material for the synthesis of lithium perchlorate (LP), which was characterized using various analytical techniques. This process provides a new avenue for recycled AP that could be effectively used as starting material for synthesis of LP. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Shim Y.-H., Ha S.-W., Yoo E.-S., Jang H.-R., Kim A.R., Ramakrishnan S., Yoo D.J.",58434451100;57197745568;56606816700;56606629300;7402063518;57211740334;7103242561;,Recovery of Ammonium Perchlorate from Obsolete Ammunition and Its Application in Synthesis of Lithium Perchlorate,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,4,,612,617,NA,5,10.1002/prep.202000235,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101041119&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000235&partnerID=40&md5=476b8a4b4f0985460f03cca23bf67db8,"R&D Center, JJPROTECH, Ham-An, Gyeognam, 637-833, South Korea; R&D Center, Materia-Nova Korea, Kyungkiodo, 16509, South Korea; Department of Chemistry, Kunsan National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Department of Life Science, Jeonbuk National University, Jeollabuk-do, 54896, South Korea","Shim, Y.-H., R&D Center, JJPROTECH, Ham-An, Gyeognam, 637-833, South Korea, R&D Center, Materia-Nova Korea, Kyungkiodo, 16509, South Korea; Ha, S.-W., R&D Center, JJPROTECH, Ham-An, Gyeognam, 637-833, South Korea, Department of Chemistry, Kunsan National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Yoo, E.-S., Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Jang, H.-R., Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Kim, A.R., Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea, Department of Life Science, Jeonbuk National University, Jeollabuk-do, 54896, South Korea; Ramakrishnan, S., Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea; Yoo, D.J., Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center, Jeonbuk National University, Gunsan-si, Jeonlabuk-do  54150, South Korea, Department of Life Science, Jeonbuk National University, Jeollabuk-do, 54896, South Korea",Ammonium perchlorate; Lithium perchlorate; Obsolete ammunition; Recycling inorganic salt,Crystallinity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Inorganic compounds; Mass spectrometry; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Propellants; Purchasing; Purification; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Ammonium perchlorates; Gun powder; ITS applications; Light signal; Lithium perchlorate; Solid oxidizers; Source material; Lithium compounds,"Kim, A.R.; Department of Energy Storage/Conversion Engineering of Graduate School, South Korea; email: kimaerhan@jbnu.ac.kr

2-s2.0-85088366567,"Hundreds of explosive-contaminated marine sites exist globally, many of which contain the common munitions constituent hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Quantitative information about RDX transformation in coastal ecosystems is essential for management of many of these sites. Isotopically labelled RDX containing 15N in all 3 nitro groups was used to track the fate of RDX in three coastal ecosystem types. Flow-through mesocosms representing subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), subtidal non-vegetated (sand) and intertidal marsh ecosystems were continuously loaded with isotopically labelled RDX for 16–17 days. Sediment, pore-water and overlying surface water were analyzed to determine the distribution of RDX, nitroso-triazine transformation products (NXs) and nitrogen containing complete mineralization products, including ammonium, nitrate+nitrite, nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas. The marsh, silt, and sand ecotypes transformed 94%, 90% and 76% of supplied RDX, respectively. Total dissolved NXs accounted for 2%–4% of the transformed 15N-RDX. The majority of RDX transformation in the water column was by mineralization to inorganic N (dissolved and evaded; 64%–78% of transformed 15N-RDX). RDX was mineralized primarily to N2O (62–74% of transformed 15N-RDX) and secondarily to N2 (1–2% of transformed 15N-RDX) which exchanged with the atmosphere. Transformation of RDX was favored in carbon-rich lower redox potential sediments of the silt and marsh mesocosms where anaerobic processes of iron and sulfate reduction were most prevalent. RDX was most persistent in the carbon-poor sand mesocosm. Partitioning of 15N derived from RDX onto sediment and suspended particulates was negligible in the overall mass balance of RDX transformation (2%–3% of transformed 15N-RDX). The fraction of 15N derived from RDX that was sorbed or assimilated in sediment was largest in the marsh mesocosm (most organic carbon), and smallest in the sand mesocosm (largest grain size and least organic carbon). Sediment redox conditions and available organic carbon stores affect the fate of RDX in different coastal marine habitats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ariyarathna T., Ballentine M., Vlahos P., Smith R.W., Cooper C., Böhlke J.K., Fallis S., Groshens T.J., Tobias C.",36627907700;54881458100;15749703500;55727432700;7403318621;7004491698;6506552820;6602605400;7102921922;,"Degradation of RDX (Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) in contrasting coastal marine habitats: Subtidal non-vegetated (sand), subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), and intertidal marsh",2020,Science of the Total Environment,745,,140800,,,NA,3,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140800,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088366567&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.140800&partnerID=40&md5=a90992efcbfab6b3fb9c9acd5f7cec04,"University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; U.S. Geological Survey, 431 National Center, Reston, VA  20192, United States; Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Chemistry Division, China Lake, CA  93555, United States","Ariyarathna, T., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; Ballentine, M., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; Vlahos, P., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; Smith, R.W., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; Cooper, C., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States; Böhlke, J.K., U.S. Geological Survey, 431 National Center, Reston, VA  20192, United States; Fallis, S., Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Chemistry Division, China Lake, CA  93555, United States; Groshens, T.J., Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Chemistry Division, China Lake, CA  93555, United States; Tobias, C., University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences, 1084 Shennecossett Road, Groton, CT  06340, United States",15N isotopic mass balance; Biodegradation; Coastal marine ecosystems; Mineralization; RDX; Sediment,"Ecosystems; Iron compounds; Mineralogy; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Redox reactions; Sand; Silt; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Suspended sediments; Wetlands; Coastal ecosystems; Hexahydro-1 ,3 ,5-trinitro-1 ,3 ,5-triazine; Largest grain sizes; Munitions constituents; Quantitative information; RDX (hexahydro-1 ,3 ,5-trinitro-1 ,3 ,5-triazine); Suspended particulates; Transformation products; Anoxic sediments; ammonia; cyclonite; iron; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; sulfate; surface water; degradation; environmental fate; intertidal environment; marine ecosystem; marsh; organic carbon; organic compound; redox conditions; subtidal environment; Article; bioremediation; biotransformation; coastal waters; controlled study; ecotype; marsh; mesocosm; mineralization; oxidation reduction potential; priority journal; sand; sea pollution; sediment; suspended particulate matter","Ariyarathna, T.; University of Connecticut, 1084 Shennecossett Road, United States; email: thivanka.ariyarathna@uconn.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Silica-covered semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide a unique and tunable photoluminescent signature that emits from within a sacrificial outer layer. Five types of silica-covered zinc sulfide QDs were synthesized and covalently bound to commercial luminescent powders. The combination of five dots and five powders enables a matrix of 25 unique tags. The tracers are shown to be tolerant of environments associated with chemical explosives and provides a unique tag to evaluate debris fields.

2-s2.0-85100231593,"Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are constructed from easily obtainable ingredients that are often unregulated and difficult to trace. Salts of the oxyhalide perchlorate are frequently used as oxidisers in IEDs and in commercially available munitions, thus a reliable detection is needed to aid forensic investigations and the tracing of environmental ground or surface water contamination. We introduce the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a biosensor for the presence of perchlorate, a promising alternative to the costly, technically challenging and time-consuming current perchlorate detection methods. Perchlorate uptake dynamics in C. elegans were first validated using ion exchange chromatography followed by assessing the effects of perchlorate on key life-point indices to verify the suitability of the nematodes as a forensic biosensor. Whole genome microarrays and qPCR analyses established that a set of immune and stress response genes were enriched during perchlorate exposure. A nematode strain (agIs219) containing an integrated copy of the significantly overexpressed t24b8.5 gene promoter followed by a GFP reporter gene was shown to fluoresce in a perchlorate dose dependent manner with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 mg mL-1. Whilst chemicals commonly used in the construction of IEDs did not induce fluorescence, exposure to other oxyhalides did, highlighting the presence of possible shared stress response pathways. Burnt wire sparklers containing potassium perchlorate elicited fluorescence while other non-perchlorate containing post-blast explosion matrices did not. This demonstrates how C. elegans can be used to screen for perchlorate at environmental hotspots, an optimization, possibly with other target transgenes, is required to enable the detection of perchlorate at concentrations below 0.5 mg mL-1.

2-s2.0-85100173382,"Ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) explosive emulsions are comparatively safe, effective and low-cost products for mining operations. They consist of a supersaturated ammonium nitrate solution dispersed as droplets in a continuous fuel phase. Here we apply a previously developed bench-top Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) technique to monitor the emulsion droplet size distribution in ANFO explosive emulsions as a function of time stored at an elevated temperature of 50 °C; we thus investigate the subtle effect of adverse storage conditions on emulsion stability.

2-s2.0-85088379872,"Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, AN) is a major commodity chemical. Its principal uses are as a fertilizer and an explosive. Ammonium nitrate is inherently unstable and has been the cause of numerous accidental explosions, sometimes with hundreds of deaths. We have investigated the thermal decomposition and methods of inhibiting the critical reactions of ammonium nitrate. NOx gas was shown to accumulate during an induction period and lead to the generation of nitrous acid (HNO2). Removal of NOx by adsorption or reduction provides alternative approaches to inhibition. In this work we reveal alternative methods to inhibit accidental ammonium nitrate explosions. Layered double hydroxides, such as hydrotalcite, were found to be very effective at inhibiting and delaying detonation by adsorbing NOx. Urea, traditionally used to inhibit explosions, was found to be very ineffective at higher temperatures (above ∼ 80 °C). However, the addition of MnO2 catalysts to urea increased its efficiency at temperatures up to ∼ 130 °C. The urea/MnO2 catalyst system was a highly effective inhibitor for preventing thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate over a wide temperature range. © 2020","Djerdjev A.M., Priyananda P., Gore J., Beattie J.K., Neto C., Hawkett B.S.",6507873012;11839824500;56385013300;7102388749;7005164416;6602971433;,Safer emulsion explosives resulting from NOx inhibition,2021,Chemical Engineering Journal,403,,125713,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.cej.2020.125713,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088379872&doi=10.1016%2fj.cej.2020.125713&partnerID=40&md5=6f789acec457a0a55a2d9e86245d97af,"School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia; Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia","Djerdjev, A.M., School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia; Priyananda, P., School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia; Gore, J., Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Mt ThorleyNSW  2330, Australia; Beattie, J.K., School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia; Neto, C., School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia; Hawkett, B.S., School of Chemistry, and The University of Sydney Nano Institute, The University of SydneyNSW  2006, Australia",Emulsion explosives; Hydrotalcite; MnO2 catalyst; NOx reduction,Catalysts; Decomposition; Emulsification; Manganese oxide; Metabolism; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Thermolysis; Urea; Accidental explosion; Ammonium nitrate; Commodity chemicals; Emulsion explosives; Induction periods; Its efficiencies; Layered double hydroxides; Wide temperature ranges; Explosives,"Djerdjev, A.M.; School of Chemistry, Australia; email: alexander.djerdjev@sydney.edu.au",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85098987472,"High-resolution synchrotron x-ray radiography with computed tomography is used to observe the evolution of porosity created by thermal exposure in two HMX-based polymer-bonded explosive compositions; LX-04 and BX-63. The measurements were made in situ, over an extended period of time, during which the samples were heated on a slow-rate thermal trajectory. The tests ended with thermal-runaway to ignition after which the samples were consumed by combustion. The primary means of damage appears to be from mechanical debonding of the HMX-binder interface with secondary contribution from chemical decomposition. Confinement and binder properties affect the amount of porosity and permeability that develops. Additionally, observations were made describing the emergence and structure of an internal ignition volume, the formation and transport of a pre-ignition melt layer, and how the early stages of combustion were affected by material morphology, mechanical confinement and melt. The contact angle between molten HMX and the fluoropolymer, Viton A, is also presented.

2-s2.0-85102586324,"BACKGROUND: Materials characterization made possible by dual energy CT (DECT) scanners is expected to considerably improve automatic detection of hazardous objects in checked and carry-on luggage at our airports. Training a computer to identify the hazardous items from DECT scans however implies training on a baggage dataset that can represent all the possible ways a threat item can packed inside a bag. Practically, however, generating such data is made challenging by the logistics (and the permissions) related to the handling of the hazardous materials. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to present a software simulation pipeline that eliminates the need for a human to handle dangerous materials and that allows for virtually unlimited variability in the placement of such materials in a bag alongside benign materials. METHODS: In this paper, we present our DEBISim software pipeline that carries out an end-to-end simulation of a DECT scanner for virtual bags. The key highlights of DEBISim are: (i) A 3D user-interactive graphics editor for constructing a virtual 3D bag with manual placement of different types of objects in it; (ii) An automated virtual bag generation algorithm for creating randomized baggage datasets; (iii) An ability to spawn deformable sheets and liquid-filled containers in a virtual bag to represent plasticized and liquid explosives; and (iv) A GPU-based X-ray forward modelling block for spiral cone-beam scanners used in checked baggage screening. RESULTS: We have tested our simulator using two standard CT phantoms: the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom and the NIST security screening phantom as well as on a set of reference materials representing commonly encountered items in checked baggage. For these phantoms, we have assessed the quality of the simulator by comparing the simulated data reconstructions with real CT scans of the same phantoms. The comparison shows that the material-specific properties as well as the CT artifacts in the scans generated by DEBISim are close to those produced by an actual scanner. CONCLUSION: DEBISim is an end-to-end simulation framework for rapidly generating X-ray baggage data for dual energy cone-beam scanners.  © 2021-IOS Press.

2-s2.0-85100581529,"Even though helium pycnometry is considered a very precise method of density determination, its use to analyse factors influencing crystal quality (e. g. solvent inclusions, amorphous states, crystal defects…) is limited due to the unknown inherent accuracy of the method. Previous studies have attempted to identify the best possible accuracy of helium pycnometry. However, no robust method has been proposed to validate even the precision obtained. This means that the often occurring, seemingly random density deviations have never been satisfactorily explained. In this study the influencing factors on density measurements of the CL-20/HMX cocrystal and phase stabilised ammonium nitrate carried out with an AccuPyc 1340 TEC were quantified and a robust method of data analysis was developed to judge with certainty the quality and significance of the data obtained. This study shows that statistical tests such as the t-test and ANOVA cannot be utilised to differentiate between samples or repeat measurements, even though the density data points exhibit a normal distribution. By utilising confidence intervals and quantifying the three major sources of error (sampling error, change in barometric pressure during the measurement, and weight in error), a repeatability of 0.015 % was achieved and a method was developed that enables differentiation between samples with a certainty as good as 0.05 %. © 2021 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85090875849,"A novel pump-probe Photothermal methodology using Quartz Tuning Fork (QTF) detector has been demonstrated for the first time. A tunable mid-IR Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) and a CW fixed wavelength visible laser have been used as the pump and probe beam respectively. The developed Photothermal (PT) technique is based on Quartz Tuning Fork (QTF) detector for the detection of hazardous/explosive molecules adsorbed on plastic surface and also in aerosols form. PT spectra of various trace molecules in the fingerprinting mid- infrared spectral band 7–9 µm from distance of 25 m have been recorded. The PT spectra of explosives RDX, TNT and Acetone have been recorded at very low quantities. Acetone is the precursor of explosive Tri-Acetone Tri-Phosphate (TATP). The experimentations using pump and probe lasers, exhibit detection sensitivity of less than 5 μg/cm2 for RDX, TNT powders and of ~ 200 nl quantity for Nitrobenzene (NB) and Acetone (in liquid form) adsorbed on surfaces, from a distance of ~ 25 m.

Thus the pump-probe PT technique is more sensitive in comparison to single tunable QCL pump beam technique and it is better suited for standoff detection of hazardous chemicals for homeland security as well as for forensic applications. © 2020, The Author(s).","Sharma R.C., Kumar S., Parmar A., Mann M., Prakash S., Thakur S.N.",57190811706;57222347138;20436661000;57211365710;57654880100;7102748881;,Standoff pump-probe photothermal detection of hazardous chemicals,2020,Scientific Reports,10,1,15053,,,NA,7,10.1038/s41598-020-71937-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090875849&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-71937-4&partnerID=40&md5=08c3baaeb74aa19b7d4a6ca943da65e7,"Defence Research and Development Establishment, DRDO, Gwalior, 474002, India; Laser Science and Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, 110054, India; Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India","Sharma, R.C., Defence Research and Development Establishment, DRDO, Gwalior, 474002, India; Kumar, S., Defence Research and Development Establishment, DRDO, Gwalior, 474002, India; Parmar, A., Defence Research and Development Establishment, DRDO, Gwalior, 474002, India; Mann, M., Laser Science and Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, 110054, India; Prakash, S., Laser Science and Technology Centre, Metcalfe House, Delhi, 110054, India; Thakur, S.N., Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India",,,"Sharma, R.C.; Defence Research and Development Establishment, India; email: rameshsharma06@yahoo.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85097196547,"The thermal stability of 1,3,5,5- tetranitrohexahydropyrimidine (TNDA) in liquid phase under isothermal conditions was studied. It was established that the TNDA decomposition (kliq=3.1 ⋅ 1021⋅exp(−26865/T), Ea=223.4 kJ mol−1) is accompanied by strong autocatalysis (kcat=9.8 ⋅ 1014⋅exp(-18056/T), Ea=150.2 kJ mol−1). The mechanism of autocatalysis was proposed. The essence of autocatalysis is the oxidation of TNDA by decomposition products, followed by the destruction of the molecule. An unusual feature of this autocatalysis is that, in contrast to autocatalysis of nitroesters, the process does not disappear at high temperatures, but rather determines the kinetics of heat release in the combustion wave. The surface temperature and combustion mechanism of TNDA were established through thermocouple studies. It was shown that the autocatalysis reaction at the surface temperature controls the burning rate. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Sinditskii V.P., Smirnova A.D., Vu T.Q., Filatov S.A., Serushkin V.V., Rudakov G.F.",6602546202;57202950562;57220187097;57196167929;6506177482;25634864600;,"Thermal Decomposition of 1,3,5,5-Tetranitrohexahydro-Pyrimidine: A New Type of Autocatalysis that Persists at High Temperatures",2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,1,,150,158,NA,5,10.1002/prep.202000259,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097196547&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000259&partnerID=40&md5=40d473cec2cb07d3ee9523e4bc2eec43,"Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation","Sinditskii, V.P., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation; Smirnova, A.D., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation; Vu, T.Q., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation; Filatov, S.A., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation; Serushkin, V.V., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation; Rudakov, G.F., Chemical Engineering Department, Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Moscow, Russian Federation","1,3,5,5-Tetranitrohexahydropyrimidine; Combustion; Decomposition kinetics; Pressure; Vapor",Atmospheric temperature; Combustion; Decomposition; Surface properties; Thermocouples; Thermodynamic stability; Burning rate; Combustion mechanism; Combustion waves; Decomposition products; Heat release; High temperature; Isothermal conditions; Surface temperatures; Surface reactions,"Sinditskii, V.P.; Chemical Engineering Department, 9 Miusskaya Sq., Russian Federation; email: vps@rctu.ru",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The optimized method involved sample loading during 2000 ms using UP water (0.1% formic acid) at a flowrate of 1.25 mL/min on a Type C C18 cartridge followed by elution of the target compounds for 3000 ms using IPA (0.1% formic acid) at 0.75 mL/min.

2-s2.0-85097349411,"Gas chromatography/vacuum UV spectroscopy (GC/VUV) was utilized to study various explosives and pharmaceuticals in the nitrate ester and nitramine structural classes. In addition to generating specific VUV spectra for each compound, VUV was used to indicate the onset of thermal decomposition based upon the appearance of break-down products such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, water, and molecular oxygen. The effect of temperature on decomposition could be fit to a logistical function where the fraction of intact compound remaining decreased as the transfer line/flow cell temperature was increased from 200 °C to 300 °C. Utilizing this relationship, the decomposition temperatures for the nitrate ester and nitramine compounds were determined to range between 244 °C and 277 °C. It was also discovered that the decomposition temperature was dependent on the GC carrier gas flow rate and, therefore, the residence time of the compounds in the transfer line/flow cell. For example, the measured decomposition temperature of nitroglycerine ranged from 222 °C to 253 °C across four flow rates. Tracking the appearance/disappearance of decomposition products across this temperature range indicated that NO, CO, and H2CO are final decomposition products while O2 and H2O are intermediate products. The decomposition temperatures for all explosives were highly correlated to similar decomposition measurements taken by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (r = 0.91) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (r = 0.90–0.98). In addition, the decomposition temperatures for all explosives were negatively correlated to the heat of explosion at constant volume (r = −0.68) and strongly positively correlated to the oxygen balance (r = 0.92). © 2020","Cruse C.A., Goodpaster J.V.",57204918890;55912901600;,Thermal and spectroscopic analysis of nitrated compounds and their break-down products using gas chromatography/vacuum UV spectroscopy (GC/VUV),2021,Analytica Chimica Acta,1143,,,117,123,NA,7,10.1016/j.aca.2020.11.041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097349411&doi=10.1016%2fj.aca.2020.11.041&partnerID=40&md5=69b6f9cb3a275664fb1c420588ee90d9,"Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 North Blackford Street, LD326, Indianapolis, IN  46202, United States; Forensic and Investigative Sciences Program, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 North Blackford Street, LD326, Indianapolis, IN  46202, United States","Cruse, C.A., Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 North Blackford Street, LD326, Indianapolis, IN  46202, United States; Goodpaster, J.V., Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 North Blackford Street, LD326, Indianapolis, IN  46202, United States, Forensic and Investigative Sciences Program, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 North Blackford Street, LD326, Indianapolis, IN  46202, United States",Explosives; Gas chromatography; Nitrated; Pharmaceuticals; Thermolysis; Vacuum UV,Carbon monoxide; Decomposition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Esters; Explosives; Flow of gases; Gas chromatography; Gravimetric analysis; Molecular oxygen; Nitrates; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen removal; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Uranium metallography; Carrier gas flow rates; Decomposition products; Decomposition temperature; Effect of temperature; Heat of explosion; Intermediate product; Temperature range; Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA); Vanadium metallography; amine; carbon monoxide; drug; ester; explosive; formaldehyde; nitramine; nitrate; nitrate ester; nitric oxide; oxygen; unclassified drug; water; Article; chemical analysis; chemical structure; decomposition; differential scanning calorimetry; flow rate; gas; gas chromatography; priority journal; temperature; thermogravimetry; ultraviolet spectroscopy; vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy,"Goodpaster, J.V.402 North Blackford Street, LD 326, United States; email: jvgoodpa@iupui.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Using a small database, machine learning methods were utilized to examine the extent of improvement in IMS selectivity for detection of nitrate-based explosives. Five classes were considered in this preliminary study: ammonium nitrate (AN), an ∼95:5 mixture of AN and fuel oil (ANFO), urea nitrate (UN), nitrate due to environmental pollution, and samples that did not contain any explosive (blanks).

2-s2.0-85090268004,"We examine the diffraction dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) detonation in a circular arc of the conventional HMX-based, high performance, solid explosive PBX 9501, for which the detonation reaction zone length scale is estimated to be of the order of 100-150 μm. In this configuration, a steady propagating detonation will develop, sweeping around the arc with constant angular speed. We report on results from three PBX 9501 arc experiments, exploring the variation in linear speed on the inner and outer arc surfaces for the steady wave along with the structure of the curved detonation front, as a function of varying inner surface radius and arc thickness. Comparisons of the properties of the motion of the steady wave for each arc configuration are then made with a spatially-distributed PBX 9501 reactive burn model, calibrated to detonation performance properties in a 2D planar slab geometry. We show that geometry-induced curvature of the detonation near the inner arc surface has a significant effect on the detonation motion even for conventional high explosives. We also examine the detonation driving zone structure for each arc case, and thus the subsonic regions of the flow that determine the influence of the arc geometry on the detonation propagation. In addition, streamline paths and reaction progress isolines are calculated. We conclude that a common approximation for modeling conventional high explosive detonation, wherein the shock-normal detonation speed is assumed equal to the Chapman-Jouguet speed, can lead to significant errors in describing the speed at which the detonation propagates. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","Short M., Anderson E.K., Chiquete C., Jackson S.I.",7101631450;57198919254;22950136100;7402695193;,Experimental and modeling analysis of detonation in circular arcs of the conventional high explosive PBX 9501,2021,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,38,3,,3683,3690,NA,6,10.1016/j.proci.2020.07.107,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090268004&doi=10.1016%2fj.proci.2020.07.107&partnerID=40&md5=a16898e90dec1f8582f111715652bfc2,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87544, United States","Short, M., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87544, United States; Anderson, E.K., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87544, United States; Chiquete, C., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87544, United States; Jackson, S.I., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87544, United States",Arc geometry; Condensed-phase; Curvature; Detonation; Diffraction,Detonation; Diffraction; Speed; Arc geometry; Circular arc; Condensed phase; Condensed phasis; Curvature; Experimental analysis; High explosives; Modeling analyzes; PBX 9501; Steady waves; Geometry,"Short, M.; Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States; email: short1@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85104553255,"Abstract: In this paper, confined explosions of HMX-based aluminized explosives in a spherical chamber are studied. The effects of aluminum particles on the afterburning reaction and explosive performance are obtained by changing the size of the particles and the gas environment. The results show that the concentration of oxygen in air is not sufficient to support complete combustion of aluminum particles. The estimated oxidation rate of aluminum particles is 87–93%, and it tends to decrease with increasing particle size. Part of aluminum particles oxidize with detonation products, and the reaction can last for hundreds of microseconds. However, the degree of oxidation between the large-sized aluminum particles and detonation products is small. A new method is used to estimate the initial energy of detonation by observing the time difference between sensing the initial light and the pressure wave. This method leads to a conclusion that some of the aluminum particles are oxidized during detonation and provide additional energy to the primary blast wave. Small micron-sized aluminum particles in the range of 48.9 nm to 46.7 μm extend the duration of the fireball. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Xiao W., Chen K., Yang M.-F., Hong X.-W., Li H.-W., Wang B.-L.",57212390007;55683533300;57216152390;57197870386;57219051305;55886703200;,Effects of the Particle Size and Gas Environment on Afterburning Reactions and Explosion Performance of Aluminized HMX-Based Explosives,2021,"Combustion, Explosion and Shock Waves",57,2,,222,231,NA,5,10.1134/S0010508221020118,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104553255&doi=10.1134%2fS0010508221020118&partnerID=40&md5=657fd975a4713213aa0f0490a299bcce,"School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China","Xiao, W., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Chen, K., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Yang, M.-F., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Hong, X.-W., School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Li, H.-W., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Wang, B.-L., School of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China",afterburning reaction; aluminized explosive; aluminum particle; confined explosion,Afterburners (engine); Aluminum powder metallurgy; Combustion knock; Detonation; Oxidation; Particle size; Aluminized explosives; Aluminum particle; Confined explosions; Degree of oxidations; Detonation product; Explosive performance; Gas environment; Time-differences; Aluminum,"Xiao, W.; School of Chemical Engineering, China; email: iridescent_bubbles@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85101547219,"Following a shooting or explosive event, such as the explosion of an improvised explosive device, smokeless powders (SP) and smokeless powder residues (SPR) may be recovered as evidence. The analysis of SPR may allow for an association to the SP, which can provide an evidentiary link. In this study, the correlation between SP and SPR is explored via Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficients and Pearson correlation coefficients. Additionally, the Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficients between SPR and expected pyrolysis products, obtained from the burning of SP compound standards, are explored to determine whether SPR composition may be predicted based on initial SP composition. Results indicated that the similarity between SP and SPR is highly composition dependent, with samples containing diphenylamine along with nitroglycerin or 2,4-dinitrotoluene exhibiting higher similarity scores, as well as those containing dibutyl phthalate. Comparison of SPR to expected pyrolysis products indicated that the ability to predict SPR composition is also dependent on the initial SP composition. The complexity of burning a mixture, such as SP, compared to burning single components may contribute to the generally low similarity coefficients observed in this comparison. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Lennert E., Bridge C.",57203970520;8280539200;,"Correlation and analysis of smokeless powder, smokeless powder residues, and lab generated pyrolysis products via GC–MS",2021,Forensic Chemistry,23,,100316,,,NA,7,10.1016/j.forc.2021.100316,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101547219&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2021.100316&partnerID=40&md5=60209914dfbdde2f5bc22c0442e2f2a4,"Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, 4111 Libra Dr, Physical Sciences Buiding #255, Orlando, FL  32816, United States; National Center for Forensic Science, University of Central Florida, PO Box 162367, Orlando, FL  32816, United States","Lennert, E., Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, 4111 Libra Dr, Physical Sciences Buiding #255, Orlando, FL  32816, United States; Bridge, C., Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, 4111 Libra Dr, Physical Sciences Buiding #255, Orlando, FL  32816, United States, National Center for Forensic Science, University of Central Florida, PO Box 162367, Orlando, FL  32816, United States",Correlation; GC–MS; Pyrolysis; Smokeless powder; Smokeless powder residue,,"Bridge, C.; National Center for Forensic Science, PO Box 162367, United States; email: cbridge@ucf.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85099521704,"We report deflagration-to-detonation transition phenomena in cylindrical columns of porous explosives based on octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX). The HMX powder and LX-14 (95.5 wt. % HMX and 4.5 wt. % estane polyurethane) prills were observed with high-speed cameras and flash x rays under conditions that allow for precise scaling and registration of the recorded images. These experimental results test the conventional assumption of axisymmetric, effective one-dimensional burning. Polycarbonate confinement tubes allowed this direct imaging with steel spheres employed as radio-opaque fiducials. Spheres embedded in the explosive column revealed the displacement of the explosive prior to deflagration. X-ray and fast camera images show that a dense plug of compact explosive develops ahead of the deflagration front. The internal fiducials register both internal changes in the plug and changes in the position between successive x-ray images. Tantalum witness strips placed on the inner wall of the explosive channel revealed radial expansion of the tube bore at successive x-ray exposures, indicating the internal pressure of about 100 MPa just before detonation. Images indicate that the deflagration is not only asymmetric but also involves newly observed transient phenomena just before detonation. We typically see a brief but continuous increase in deflagration speed and the formation of a deflagration channel that bypasses the plug just prior to detonation. We hypothesize that these phenomena play an important role in the deflagration-to-detonation transition itself. © 2021 Author(s).","Tringe J.W., Stobbe D.M., Parker G.R., Smilowitz L., Henson B.F., De Haven M.R., Ruch A.J., White B.W., Reaugh J.E., Vandersall K.S.",6603625195;6602936338;8617962900;6701428781;7003492327;23391991800;57221587541;35320603600;6602933776;6507554163;,Observation of asymmetric explosive density evolution in the deflagration-to-detonation transition for porous explosives,2021,Journal of Applied Physics,129,3,35901,,,NA,5,10.1063/5.0031340,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099521704&doi=10.1063%2f5.0031340&partnerID=40&md5=60e98c06f0ec13d2eb2c264cd298f3ff,"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Tringe, J.W., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Stobbe, D.M., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Parker, G.R., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Smilowitz, L., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Henson, B.F., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; De Haven, M.R., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Ruch, A.J., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; White, B.W., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Reaugh, J.E., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States; Vandersall, K.S., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA  94550, United States",,Combustion; High speed cameras; HMX; Deflagration to detonation transition; Density evolution; Direct imaging; Internal changes; Radial expansions; Steel spheres; Transient phenomenon; X-ray exposure; Detonation,"Stobbe, D.M.; Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States; email: stobbe2@llnl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The boundary temperature of our aluminum confinement cylinder was ramped in 10 minutes from room temperature to a prescribed set-point temperature ranging between 448 nd 468 K and held at the set-point temperature until ignition. A universal cookoff model (UCM) has been calibrated using the ε-CL-20 SITI data to predict pressurization and thermal ignition of ε-CL-20. The ignition model was validated by using one-dimensional time-to-explosion (ODTX) ignition data from a different laboratory. We found that a thirtyfold increase in the reaction rates due to liquefaction at 520 K could explain the high temperature ODTX cookoff data. The model gives a plausible explanation of why melting is important in fast cookoff events involving CL-20.

However, the method based on HPLC is not known for the analysis of DATNBI. In this study, a HPLC method has been developed and validated for DATNBI. After the optimization of chromatographic conditions, a reversed-phase HPLC method has been established by using phenyl-hexyl column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 µm) with the detection wavelength of 230 nm. The retention time of DATNBI is 10.37 min with the resolution of all peaks over 2.10. Meanwhile, the method has been also validated and displayed good accuracy, precision, stability and robustness for the analysis of DATNBI.

In order to increase the understanding, the fragmentation observed for large collections of organic molecules, mainly drugs and pesticides, has been studied and reviewed. In the current study, attention is focused at nitro-group related and halogen-related fragmentation of organic compounds with nitro and halogen groups. The fragmentation of 140 nitro-group and 300 halogen-containing compounds has been studied. Both nitro and halogen moieties can show losses of a radical (•OH, •NO, •NO2, •Cl, •Br, or •I), which may or may not be in competition with losses of the corresponding molecules (HNO, HNO2, HCl, HBr, or HI). For compounds with a nitro group, the chemical surroundings may influence the fragmentation, as illustrated by the ortho-effect, but also by examples of concerted losses. The competitive nature of the various fragmentation pathways is important in understanding the fragmentation, but the complexity of the processes hinders the ability to predict whether or not a particular fragmentation route is taken.

The integration of high explosives and an energetic passivator is considered to be the most useful method in achieving this object. Herein, to explore the effect of 2,4,6-triamino-3,5-dinitropyridine-1-oxide (TANPyO) on the detonation properties and mechanical safety of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX)-based PBX, two methods including direct mixing and crystallization coating were utilized to prepare main explosives, followed by the solvent suspension distillation method to obtain relevant composites. The morphology, mechanical sensitivity, and detonation velocity of as-prepared samples were tested and characterized, as well as armor-piercing ability. Results show that TANPyO plays a positive role in increasing the mechanical safety of RDX-based PBX and is reflected by the 4 %-56 % reduction in explosion probability than that of pure RDX. Moreover, the prepared samples using the crystallization coating method exhibit better performances in detonation velocity and perforation ability than the direct mixing method. These differences reach the peak when the mass ratio of RDX and TANPyO is 1 : 1. In that situation, the reduced values of explosion probability are 20 % (impact sensitivity) and 8 % (friction sensitivity) and the increasing detonation velocity is 309 m ⋅ s−1.

S4N4 has primary explosive properties. It has a working capacity greater than silver azide, AgN3, and is capable to initiate TNT.

S4N4 is stable, non-ageing, non-toxic, insoluble in water and hence an interesting candidate for future lead tricinate replacement. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Koch E.-C., Sućeska M.",7201389568;6602707254;,"Analysis of the Explosive Properties of Tetrasulfur Tetranitride, S4N4",2021,Zeitschrift fur Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie,647,4,,192,199,NA,5,10.1002/zaac.202000406,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099857444&doi=10.1002%2fzaac.202000406&partnerID=40&md5=cfcb22c18f39fe54c3e96c06c39a0c2a,"Lutradyn Energetic Materials Science & Technology, Burgherrenstraße 132, Kaiserslautern, D-67661, Germany; Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering, Department of Mining Engineering and Geotechnics, University of Zagreb, Pierottijeva 6, Zagreb, 100000, Croatia","Koch, E.-C., Lutradyn Energetic Materials Science & Technology, Burgherrenstraße 132, Kaiserslautern, D-67661, Germany; Sućeska, M., Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering, Department of Mining Engineering and Geotechnics, University of Zagreb, Pierottijeva 6, Zagreb, 100000, Croatia",combustion; detonation; equation of state; primary explosive; tetrasulfur tetranitride,Explosives; Lead compounds; Explosive compounds; Explosive properties; Friction sensitivities; Impact sensitivities; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; Primary explosive; Stability regimes; Working capacity; Silver compounds,"Koch, E.-C.; Lutradyn Energetic Materials Science & Technology, Burgherrenstraße 132, Germany; email: e-c.koch@lutradyn.com

2-s2.0-85098652138,"PBX 9404, composed of 94 wt% HMX (1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane), 3 wt% NC (nitrocellulose), 2.9 wt% CEF (tris(beta-chloroethyl) phosphate) and 0.1 wt% DPA (diphenylamine), has often been observed with a slight to entire blue discoloration of the manufactured prills. This blue discoloration has been observed since the formulation development of PBX 9404 in the late 1950s. In order to determine the source of the blue discoloration in PBX 9404, ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorbance of PBX 9404 and two potential candidates for the discoloration, p-nitrosodiphenylamine (p-NDPA) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (N-NDPA) were evaluated. An absorbance band at 590 nm in PBX 9404 sample was attributed to the blue discoloration while p-NDPA and N-NPDA had different absorbance bands. Using the knowledge gained from the UV/Vis analysis, a semi-targeted approach using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography coupled to UV/Vis detector and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UV/Vis-QTOF) was implemented. Investigating the UHPLC-UV/Vis-QTOF chromatograms at a wavelength of 590 nm, a single compound was tentatively identified as being the source of the blue discoloration. Targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on the compound and subsequent analysis indicated that 4,4′-{[4-(Phenylimino)-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]methylene}bis(N-phenylaniline), also known as Spirit Blue Base, was the source of the blue discoloration, which was confirmed using a standard.

2-s2.0-85096486529,"When subjected to a shock of insufficient strength to trigger prompt reaction, heterogenous condensed phase explosives can form regions where significant amounts of the explosive remain unreacted for times much greater than the reaction time of the detonating explosive. This phenomena is observed for the explosive PBX 9502 (95 wt% TATB) both for planar and oblique input shocks. In this work, we build on previous results by performing cylinder expansion (CYLEX) tests where the explosive charge is comprised of a faster core of PBX 9501 (95 wt% HMX) inside a slower annulus of PBX 9502. The detonation in the faster PBX 9501 drives an oblique shock into the adjacent PBX 9502, and an annular transverse initiating layer (IL) results. In the test geometry, the IL travels steadily down the length of the test after a short run distance. At radial positions beyond the IL, an annular region of detonating PBX 9502 is observed. Using standard CYLEX test diagnostics, we infer the total energy release of this experiment. By making the assumptions that (1) the combined energy release is comprised of contributions from detonating PBX 9501, detonating PBX 9502, and the IL in the PBX 9502 and (2) mass-specific energy release for the detonating explosives is approximately the same as typically observed for each explosive, the IL energy release and reaction efficiency can be computed. Results are compared to prior results for a similar geometry, and indicate that while shock deadened PBX 9502 does not detonate promptly, it does eventually release a significant portion of its chemical potential energy over longer timescales on the order of 10 μs. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","Anderson E.K., Chiquete C., Jackson S.I.",57198919254;22950136100;7402695193;,Experimental measurement of energy release from an initiating layer in an insensitive explosive,2021,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,38,3,,3733,3740,NA,8,10.1016/j.proci.2020.07.150,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096486529&doi=10.1016%2fj.proci.2020.07.150&partnerID=40&md5=33392d7b8ea96366ccc8ccb00231c37a,"Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Anderson, E.K., Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Chiquete, C., Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Jackson, S.I., Shock and Detonation Physics Group, Explosive Science and Shock Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Cylinder test; Dead zone; Detonation; Initiation layer,Cylinders (shapes); Potential energy; Testing; Cylinder expansion test; Cylinder tests; Dead zones; Detonating explosives; Energy release; Initiation layer; Insensitive explosives; Measurements of; PBX 9501; PBX 9502; Detonation,"Anderson, E.K.; Shock and Detonation Physics Group, United States; email: eanderson@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85089651704,"Here we develop a mathematical model for evaporation of an explosive thin film. Such an objective stems from the problem of trace explosive detection by techniques based on explosive vapor recording. In particular, we have previously devised an instrumentation system for standoff trace explosive detection by the active spectral imaging method. To determine the applicability limits of remote trace explosive detection methods, one should understand the regularities of evaporation dynamics of an explosive thin film, depending on explosive properties, film geometry (thickness, surface area), and ambient conditions. The mathematical model relies on the Hertz-Knudsen- Langmuir equation for evaporation rate and allows for heat exchange between the surface and ambient gas and for heat loss due to evaporation. The fact that phase transition temperature in a thin film is lower than that in a large volume of an explosive was also taken into account. The parametric study of the model was performed. The basic parameters and their variation range affecting the film evaporation rate were identified. Estimations were done for the substance mass in air during the evaporation of explosive thin films within a wide range of the parameters used.

2-s2.0-85099047089,"Physical vapor deposition of organic explosives enables growth of polycrystalline films with a unique microstructure and morphology compared to the bulk material. This study demonstrates the ability to control crystal orientation and porosity in pentaerythritol tetranitrate films by varying the interfacial energy between the substrate and the vapor-deposited explosive. Variation in density, porosity, surface roughness, and optical properties is achieved in the explosive film, with significant implications for initiation sensitivity and detonation performance of the explosive material. Various surface science techniques, including angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and multiliquid contact angle analysis, are utilized to characterize interfacial characteristics between the substrate and explosive film. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of pentaerythritol tetranitrate surfaces and fracture cross sections illustrate the difference in morphology evolution and the microstructure achieved through surface energy modification. X-ray diffraction studies with the Tilt-A-Whirl three-dimensional pole figure rendering and texture analysis software suite reveal that high surface energy substrates result in a preferred (110) out-of-plane orientation of pentaerythritol tetranitrate crystallites and denser films. Low surface energy substrates create more randomly textured pentaerythritol tetranitrate and lead to nanoscale porosity and lower density films. This work furthers the scientific basis for interfacial engineering of polycrystalline organic explosive films through control of surface energy, enabling future study of dynamic and reactive detonative phenomena at the microscale. Results of this study also have potential applications to active pharmaceutical ingredients, stimuli-responsive polymer films, organic thin film transistors, and other areas.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

2-s2.0-85100665505,"In Taiwan, due to intensive religious ceremonial activities, the flying and pyrotechnic fireworks of firecrackers are commonly used. In the course of the activities, the use of water as a cooling measure has been pointed out in the past literature that it may cause pyrotechnic materials to deteriorate and reduce their thermal stability. To determine the possible influence of water addition on pyrotechnic deterioration, this study estimates the degree of thermal hazard of pyrotechnic based on the analysis of heat release, reaction kinetics, and the heat exchange model of pyrotechnic deterioration. The explosion sound (ES) firecracker was used to analyze the thermal hazard and mixed water (ES + W) to simulate the dampness condition using differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic equations simulating thermal hazard safety parameters, combined with thermokinetic and thermal runaway data results, were used to discuss the safety and potential thermal hazard characteristics of ES, as the safety of fireworks in storage, transportation, process conditions, and operation assessment to curtail the probability of accidents. The results showed that if the initial exothermic temperature of ES + W is higher than ES, a thermal decomposition reaction will occur at a lower temperature, and the exothermic heat rises and the apparent activation energy decreases, indicating that the ES will increase its instability after being damp. The presence of water degenerated the ES and resulted in a violent reaction during the release process to explode the ES, which increased the chance of accidents among the onlookers. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Cao C.-R., Chen W.-C., Jhang W.-C., Chung Y.-H., Lin W.-C.",56822861500;56042303800;56707206100;57190609942;57194420600;,Thermal decomposition and evaluation thermokinetic parameters for explosive type,2021,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,144,2,,443,454,NA,3,10.1007/s10973-020-10475-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100665505&doi=10.1007%2fs10973-020-10475-7&partnerID=40&md5=d3be28650559fc377688b72c0c731203,"Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan; Bachelor Program in Industrial Technology, YunTech, 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan","Cao, C.-R., Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan; Chen, W.-C., Bachelor Program in Industrial Technology, YunTech, 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan; Jhang, W.-C., Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan; Chung, Y.-H., Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan; Lin, W.-C., Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin  64002, Taiwan",Deterioration; Firework; Thermal hazard; Thermal hazard parameters; Thermodynamic equation,Accidents; Activation energy; Decomposition; Deterioration; Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital storage; Explosions; Explosives; Hazards; Thermolysis; Apparent activation energy; Exothermic temperature; Influence of water; Lower temperatures; Pyrotechnic materials; Thermal decomposition reaction; Thermodynamic equations; Thermokinetic parameters; Reaction kinetics,"Chen, W.-C.; Bachelor Program in Industrial Technology, 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Taiwan; email: chenwchun@gemail.yuntech.edu.tw",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85103425783,"Security and forensic applications employ test and reference materials to develop, calibrate, and validate analytical instrumentation such as mass spectrometry for the trace detection and chemical analysis of target analytes. An emerging class of target analytes includes homemade fuel oxidizer explosives based on pyrotechnics, propellants, and powder mixtures. Test materials for these compounds must appropriately and accurately embody the physical and chemical nature of the threat. Precision liquid deposition methods have long been employed for creation of trace level test materials. Mass spectral similarity and chemical signature differences between solid particulate and solution cast (i.e., liquid deposited) propellant samples were investigated by infrared thermal desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (IRTD-DART-MS). Differences in the mass spectra and ion distributions of solid and liquid deposited black powders and black powder substitutes were observed. These differences were attributed to chemical processes (e.g., degradation) and physical differences in the crystal formation, spatial distribution, morphology, and size. The production and deposition of test and reference materials remain critical to developing new technologies and detecting evolving threats.  © 2021 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

2-s2.0-85100437530,"The thermal behaviour of TKX-50 was reinvestigated in an extended temperature range by means of temperature resolved X-ray diffraction. TKX-50, synthesized at the Fraunhofer ICT, was identified using Rietveld-analysis and reference data from the CCDC. Monitoring the refined crystal data versus temperature verified a highly anisotropic expansion behavior connected to a layer structure. However, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) were found at an order of magnitude higher than reported, and a slight bent of lattice parameter a was found near room temperature. At temperatures between 180 and 200 °C the decomposition of TKX-50 started with the formation of 1 to 5 wt.% diammonium 5,5’-bistetrazole-1,1’-diolate (ABTOX). Moreover, the micro structure was investigated by means of size/strain analysis and so called indexed Williamson-Hall plot. The analysis revealed moderate micro strain and absence of size broadening. The results give rise to the hypothesis that the (010) layer structure supports a low sensitivity of TKX-50 without impairment of the mechanical stability.

2-s2.0-85100905598,"The paper addresses the role of crystal anisotropy on the evolution of heterogeneous temperature fields in plastic-bonded explosives (PBXs) under conditions of weak shock. The modeling approach is based on simplified idealizations of PBX microstructure including RDX grains and estane binder regions subjected to velocity boundary conditions representative of impact conditions in situ. The constitutive description of the microstructure constituents includes a dislocation-based, anisotropic, single crystal plasticity model for the explosive grains and a linear viscoelastic model to represent the estane binder. Large suites of simulations were used to systematically study the correlation in heating of the grains with local wave dynamics, crystal orientation, and the microstructural neighborhood. These correlations were identified through the selection of characteristics of crystal anisotropy including oriented wave speeds and Taylor factor. A key observation is that the wave dispersion within a certain distance from the impact interface plays a dominant role in the temperature field. Beyond this distance, individual crystal orientations play a more dominant role, but cannot entirely account for the observed heterogeneity without consideration of the local microstructure neighborhood. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Mohan N., Luscher D.J., Cawkwell M.J., Addessio F.L., Ramos K.J.",55508343100;6603288835;6602604553;6602098883;14059027500;,Modeling Microstructural Effects on Heterogeneous Temperature Fields within Polycrystalline Explosives,2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,5,,713,722,NA,4,10.1002/prep.202000282,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100905598&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000282&partnerID=40&md5=9a515204fa3e1babc8208efd69208205,"ATCO SpaceLab, Calgary, AB  T3E 8B4, Canada; Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States","Mohan, N., ATCO SpaceLab, Calgary, AB  T3E 8B4, Canada; Luscher, D.J., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Cawkwell, M.J., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Addessio, F.L., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Ramos, K.J., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States",energetic materials; finite element modeling; impact; mesoscale modeling; microstructure,Anisotropy; Explosives; Microstructure; Single crystals; Viscoelasticity; Crystal anisotropy; Linear viscoelastic; Micro-structural; Micro-structural effects; Plastic bonded explosives; Polycrystalline; Single crystal plasticity; Velocity boundary condition; Crystal orientation,"Luscher, D.J.; Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States; email: djl@lanl.gov",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85126076045,"Visual and selective detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) for public and environmental protection is an extremely urgent issue and challenge. Herein, a novel fluorescence polyurethane (FPU) has been successfully synthesized and exploited for selective TNP-detection in coexistence with other commonly competitive nitroaromatic analytes. Excellent recognition ability of FPU toward TNP could reach as low as 0.12 μM and the observed fluorescence responses of FPU are exceptional stable to acid, alkali, and salt. Furthermore, a portable, cost effective, and simple indicator paper depending on FPU for visual detection of TNP is developed. FPU indicator paper exhibits two unique advantages: one is the higher selectivity for TNP detection, the other is realizing the rapid and visual explosives detection. The detection mechanism is described for the synergies in the photoelectron transfer (PET), the fluorescence internal filtration effect (IFE) and the fluorescence energy transfer (FRET).

2-s2.0-85099192297,"The paper reports the charge transfer mechanism between poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and high energy materials such as RDX, HMX and TNT, respectively in terms of ratios of anti-stokes (AS) and stokes(S) Raman lines of NO2 bands. Generally it works as an effective sensing medium for the detection of explosives when mixed in an equal proportion and are subjected to 532 nm wavelength without any chemical treatment [1]. The pristine PEDOT is less sensitive to 532 nm wavelength (2.33 eV) but influences the Raman S and AS lines of explosives in the mixture. The study also reveals that a small quantity (one milligram) of PEDOT is sufficient to initiate the positive charge transfer mechanism between its oxidized state to the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms of the nitro group of the explosive molecules. Consequently, the intensity of the Raman spectra of RDX, HMX and TNT is dropped by an order of 22.5, 11.45 and 17.2 times, respectively along with the shift of the NO2 vibrational modes. It is also attributed to Photon-electron–phonon interaction. Finally, we have estimated the reduced mass of the functional group to ascertain the force constant and the intensity ratios of AS /S lines to confirm the charge transfer mechanism.

In the present study, we report the structural and electronic properties of the emerging green primary explosives K2BDAF and K2DNABT under hydrostatic pressure up to 10 GPa. We observed that dispersion correction methods are important for capturing weak intermolecular interactions in order to accurately describe the geometries of the primary explosives. The computed ground state structural properties using optB86b-vdW method are in good agreement with the experimental results. The pressure-dependent lattice constants and bond parameters show anisotropic nature and also a sharp discontinuity around 4–5 GPa. The obtained equilibrium bulk modulus shows that K2BDAF is softer than K2DNABT. Bonding analysis revealed that the C-NO2 energetic functional groups are more sensitive than the stable ring structure under hydrostatic pressure. The calculated electronic structure of K2BDAF using the Tran–Blaha-modified Becke–Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential shows a direct-to-indirect band gap transition around 5 GPa, which is consistent with the aforementioned discontinuity of the structure, while K2DNABT is found to be a direct-band-gap insulator in the studied pressure range of 1–10 GPa.

The impact and friction sensitivities have been obtained along with the measured detonation velocities. The detonation characteristics have also been calculated using the EXPLO5 code. The relationship between performance and sensitivity to mechanical impulses has been investigated. The results have shown that DATB has a significant influence on the reduction of the sensitivity of BCHMX to a level close to TNT and much lower than all the other studied plastic explosives. In addition, the new PBX based on BCHMX and DATB has higher detonation characteristics than the commercial PBXs and TNT.

The results showed that the application of the above method helped the regeneration efficiency of activated carbon reach 95.26 % after 60 minutes of treatment. The optimum conditions were given with an microwave power of 500 W, a nitrogen pressure of 0.015 MPa. The above method has a high environmental significance when the effluent after regeneration has a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 130 mg/l, allowing it to be discharged into the environment. The method also makes economic sense when activated carbon can be regenerated many times. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH",Nhi B.D.,55763070200;,"Research on Regenerating Activated Carbon in 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) Explosives Manufacturing Industry by Microwave Radiation and Ionized Nitrogen",2021,"Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics",46,1,,7,12,NA,4,10.1002/prep.202000166,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097615782&doi=10.1002%2fprep.202000166&partnerID=40&md5=cdf5d1923bd052a2c808479472de284c,"Faculty of Environmental Technology, Viet Tri University of Industry, Tien Kien, Lam Thao, Phu Tho, Viet Nam","Nhi, B.D., Faculty of Environmental Technology, Viet Tri University of Industry, Tien Kien, Lam Thao, Phu Tho, Viet Nam","2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene; Activated carbon; Ionized nitrogen; Microwave radiation; Regeneration","Activated carbon; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Explosives; Industrial research; Ionization; Nitrogen compounds; Wastewater treatment; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Environmental significance; Ionized nitrogen; Manufacturing industries; Microwave power; Nitrogen pressure; Optimum conditions; Regeneration efficiency; Activated carbon treatment","Nhi, B.D.; Faculty of Environmental Technology, Tien Kien, Viet Nam; email: vietnamkz@yahoo.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The violence of the detonator was quantified by measuring the velocity of the detonator closure disc (or """"flyer""""). The maximum flyer velocity of a thermally ignited detonator was comparable in magnitude to that obtained by initiating a room temperature pristine detonator with an exploding bridge wire (under the same confinement); however, the high flyer velocity was not an indication of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in the thermally ignited detonator. The detonator responded more violently than a thermally ignited detonator when initiated at 95% of the ignition delay time.

2-s2.0-85092895904,"Ten impact experiments are presented that probe the initiation behavior of an RDX-based explosive. The explosive pellets were impacted by thin aluminum impactors supported by low-impedance polymers, thereby subjecting the pellets to short duration shocks. Impact conditions were used to determine impact tilt, pulse pressure and duration, sample transit time, and whether or not a detonation occurred. Exploding Foil Initiator (EFI) launchers were used as a baseline for evaluating the technique, and it was found that the present technique addresses multiple shortcomings of EFI-based systems. The aluminum foil allowed impacts with pressure durations of 70–80 ns, resulting in input conditions closely matching those of EFI-based systems. The thicker aluminum plate impactors resulted in pulse durations of approximately 600 ns and allowed access to a previously inaccessible region of the initiation curve. Initiation thresholds were bracketed using both impactors, and the data is compared with complementary initiation data from EFI-based systems with good agreement. Based on the results and closely related work, a novel, physically-based criterion is proposed to allow the initiation curve to be predicted based on the explosive's unreacted equation of state and sustained-pulse, shock-to-detonation run distance (the “Pop-plot”), giving a physical basis for previously published observations. Finally, the criterion is applied to the data available to propose a relationship between pressure, pulse duration, and run distance, suggesting that input pulse durations of 50–100 % higher than the critical condition should be applied to approximate the run distance of a sustained pulse. © Published 2020.

2-s2.0-85104759449,"The identification of energetic materials in containments is an important challenge for analytical methods in the field of safety and security. Opening a package without knowledge of its contents and the resulting hazards is highly involved with risks and should be avoided whenever possible. Therefore, preferable methods work non-destructive with minimal interaction and are capable of identifying target substances in a containment quickly and reliably. Most spectroscopic methods find their limits, if the target substance is shielded by a covering material. To solve this problem, a combined laser drilling method with subsequent identification of the target substance by means of Raman spectroscopic measurements through microscopic bore holes of the covering material is presented. A pulsed laser beam is used for both the drilling process and as an excitation source for Raman measurements in the same optical setup. Results show the ability of this new method to gain high-quality spectra even when performed through microscopic small bore channels. With the laser parameters chosen right, the method can even be performed on highly sensitive explosives like triacetone triperoxide (TATP). Another advantageous effect arises in an observed reduction in unwanted fluorescence signal in the spectral data, resulting from the confocal-like measurement setup with the bore hole acting as aperture. © 2021, The Author(s).","Wild D., Theiß C., Holl G.",57195070203;57195067895;6701852484;,Contact-free and fast detection of energetic materials in containments,2021,European Physical Journal Plus,136,4,437,,,NA,2,10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01406-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104759449&doi=10.1140%2fepjp%2fs13360-021-01406-y&partnerID=40&md5=2ce7d79149804a2a1d9365031a239f51,"Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructures, German Aerospace Center, St. Augustin, 53757, Germany; Institute of Detection Technologies, Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Rheinbach, 53359, Germany","Wild, D., Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructures, German Aerospace Center, St. Augustin, 53757, Germany; Theiß, C., Institute of Detection Technologies, Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Rheinbach, 53359, Germany; Holl, G., Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructures, German Aerospace Center, St. Augustin, 53757, Germany, Institute of Detection Technologies, Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Rheinbach, 53359, Germany",,,"Wild, D.; Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructures, Germany; email: dominik.wild@dlr.de",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Empirical and numerical models that were developed to estimate structural capacity are reviewed. The structural idealization, theoretical basis, and merits of various methods are also described. The influence of various parameters affecting the structural performance is discussed. Findings: The material of the paper captures recent engineering developments that can be used by practitioners for blast analysis and design for industrial and residential buildings. Little emphasis was given in the published literature to develop simplified analytical models that can be used in practice to compute the dynamic response of buildings subject to accidental explosions. Furthermore, analytical expressions are required to compute the reduction in the stiffness due to impact loading. Originality/value: Current building codes address conventional live, dead, wind and earthquake loads. Very few guidelines are available in practice for design of buildings subject to blast loading.

2-s2.0-85100801379,"The process of the explosion damage in confined space mainly involves two parts, shock wave pressure effect and quasi-static pressure effect. A complicated afterburning reaction occurs in the internal explosion of aluminized explosives, not only enhancing the intensity of the shock wave, but also having a great influence on the final quasi-static pressure. A theoretical calculation model of final quasi-static pressure for aluminized explosive in confined space considering afterburning effect was proposed, based on the analysis of chemical reaction, the law of conservation of energy and the improved Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state. The factor that the volume of gaseous explosive products decreases in the afterburning reaction was also taken into consideration. The results of RDX-based and HMX-based charges calculated by the model were then analyzed and compared with the references’ experimental results as well as Anderson’s empirical formulas’ to verify the reliability and correctness of the proposed model. The results show that: the final quasi-static pressure of aluminized explosive calculated by the theoretical calculation model is in good agreement with the results of experimental measurement in the papers and the relative error doesn’t exceed 10%; the Anderson’s empirical formula is inapplicable to predict the final quasi-static pressure of the aluminized explosive in confined space. The study in this paper can provide a better theoretical calculation model to predict the final quasi-static pressure of aluminized explosives and provide some reference and guidance for the assessment of internal explosion damage of aluminized explosive and the design of explosive-resistant structures. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

2-s2.0-85097147512,"Advancement in rapid targeted chemical analysis of homemade and improvised explosive devices is critical for the identification of explosives-based hazards and threats. Gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis (GEMBE), a robust electrokinetic separation technique, was employed for the separation and detection of common inorganic oxidizers from frequently encountered fuel-oxidizer mixtures. The GEMBE system incorporated sample and run buffer reservoirs, a short capillary (5 cm), an applied electric field, and a pressure-driven counterflow. GEMBE provided a separation format that allowed for continuous injection of sample, selectivity of analytes, and no sample cleanup or filtration prior to analysis. Nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate oxidizers were successfully detected from low explosive propellants (e.g., black powders and black powder substitutes), pyrotechnics (e.g., flash powder), and tertiary explosive mixtures (e.g., ammonium nitrate- and potassium chlorate-based fuel-oxidizer mixtures). Separation of these mixtures exhibited detection without interference from a plethora of additional organic and inorganic fuels, enabled single particle analysis, and demonstrated semiquantitative capabilities. The bulk counterflow successfully excluded difficult components from fouling the capillary, yielding estimated limits of detection down to approximately 10 μmol/L. Finally, nitrate was separated and detected from postblast debris collected and directly analyzed from two nitrate-based charges. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Krauss S.T., Forbes T.P., Jobes D.",56660392600;22955635800;57220184439;,"Inorganic oxidizer detection from propellants, pyrotechnics, and homemade explosive powders using gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis",2021,Electrophoresis,42,3,,279,288,NA,3,10.1002/elps.202000279,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097147512&doi=10.1002%2felps.202000279&partnerID=40&md5=5a59a51838d39bbd86d6705adc372f1a,"National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, United States; Department of Physics and Engineering Physics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, United States","Krauss, S.T., National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, United States; Forbes, T.P., National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, United States; Jobes, D., Department of Physics and Engineering Physics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, United States",CE; Conductivity detection; Explosives; Inorganic oxidizers; Screening,"Electric fields; Electrophoresis; Inorganic compounds; Nitrates; Potassium compounds; Propellants; Black powder; CE; Conductivity detection; Counterflow; Electrokinetic separation; Gradient elution; Improvised explosives devices; Inorganic oxidizer; Inorganics; Moving boundary electrophoresis; Explosives; chlorate; explosive; nitrate; perchlorate; propellant; pyrotechnic; unclassified drug; explosive; inorganic compound; oxidizing agent; Article; chemical analysis; controlled study; electric field; electrophoresis; gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis; limit of detection; oxidation; particle size; pressure measurement; process optimization; capillary electrophoresis; chemistry; procedures; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Explosive Agents; Inorganic Chemicals; Oxidants","Krauss, S.T.; National Institute of Standards and TechnologyUnited States; email: skrauss@rti.org

2-s2.0-85096368755,"The canine olfactory system is a highly efficient and intricate tool often exploited by humans for detection for its many attributes, including impressive sensitivity to trace analyte vapors. Canine detectors are often touted as having lower limits of detection, or olfactory detection threshold (ODT), than other field-relevant detection technologies; however, previous attempts to quantify canine ODTs have resulted in reported estimates spanning multiple orders of magnitude, even for the same analyte. A major contributor to these discrepancies is the vapor delivery method used for testing, where losses due to adsorption and dilution are often unaccounted for, and the presence of unattended compounds in the vapor stream due to carryover may go unnoticed. In this research, a trace vapor generator (TV-Gen) was used to deliver quantitatively accurate amounts of vapor reproducibly over time for canine testing. Analyte losses due to adsorption to surfaces in the flow path, dilution in the sniff port at the outlet, and analyte carryover were considered. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling was used to visualize analyte vapor spread throughout the port. CFD simulations revealed the need for a diffuser to encourage the diffusion of the analyte throughout the port. As a result, the modified vapor generator provides analyte air as a diffuse flow that is evenly distributed through the custom sampling orifice, as opposed to a narrow stream of air at the chosen concentration which exits directly into the environment. Laboratory validations were carried out for three analytes, amyl acetate, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and methyl benzoate. A linear response across more than two orders of magnitude vapor concentration range was achieved for all analytes. These efforts will be applied in further research utilizing this TV-Gen vapor delivery system for canine ODT testing, eliminating many quantitative changes seen previously.

This work reports the structure, molecular interactions, equation of state, and electronic properties of TEX using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations. The simulated lattice parameters and molecular interactions are in good agreement with the experimental data at ambient pressure. Furthermore, the high-pressure characterization of TEX is studied as well. A good agreement of the simulated and experimental unit-cell constants is obtained as a function of pressure up to 10 GPa, and a structural change is identified at around 1.5 GPa. The pressure dependence of the molecular geometries and interactions confirm this change and suggest that it involves a pressure-induced distorted nitro functional group. Moreover, the equation of state of TEX in the range of 0–10 GPa is determined by fitting the pressure–volume (P–V) data to the Birch–Murnahan equation of state. From the first-principles bandgap criterion, the impact sensitivity of TEX under high pressure is predicted. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Wang W., Li H., Liu Q., Liu F., Liu Z.",55629627800;57219051305;35264665900;57141047400;7406679245;,High-Pressure Characterization of the Cage-Structured Explosive TEX by Dispersion-Corrected DFT Calculations,2021,Physica Status Solidi (B) Basic Research,258,2,2000329,,,NA,4,10.1002/pssb.202000329,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091151324&doi=10.1002%2fpssb.202000329&partnerID=40&md5=63719b637082efa52afbedb409e38eaf,"School of Science, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, 710121, China; School of Physical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education of China, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China","Wang, W., School of Science, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, 710121, China; Li, H., School of Science, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, 710121, China; Liu, Q., School of Physical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education of China, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China; Liu, F., School of Physical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education of China, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China; Liu, Z., State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China",explosives; high-pressure; Hirshfeld surfaces; structural properties,Calculations; Density functional theory; Dispersions; Electronic properties; Explosives; Molecular interactions; Molecular structure; Ambient pressures; Dispersion-corrected density functional; Equation of state; Function of pressure; Impact sensitivities; Molecular geometries; Nitramine explosives; Pressure dependence; Equations of state,"Wang, W.; School of Science, China; email: wangwenpeng@xupt.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85100763114,"Near real-time detection and identification of explosives from safe distances remains a challenging defense technology that requires both scientific and engineering perspectives in the design and development. Here, we demonstrated a cost-effective standoff Raman system for detecting explosive materials from distances up to 30 m. The optical system consists of an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope for Raman scattering light collection, while a compact grism was used to generate Raman spectrogram. An image intensifier from night vision technology was incorporated for amplifying the extremely weak Raman spectrum to a level detectable by a thermoelectric-cooled CMOS camera. A nanosecond pulsed laser at 440 nm with peak power of 0.41 MW was used as an excitation source, and the standoff Raman measurement was performed for test samples, including Ba(NO3)2, BaSO4 and NaNO3 powders. The spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio performance of the system were evaluated for the samples placed at distances of 10, 20 and 30 m. It was found that the standoff Raman system can resolve such Raman spectra, showing clear characteristic peaks of Ba(NO3)2, BaSO4 and NaNO3 at 1,045.9, 986.4 and 1,066.5 cm-1, respectively.

2-s2.0-85089078218,"Investigation of two common explosives such as cyclonite (RDX) and cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX) using a mass spectrometer with ultrahigh resolution and accuracy has not been comprehensively performed. Here, ultrahigh mass accuracy 15-T Fourier transform–ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) spectra were utilized to comprehensively characterize the adduct ions of RDX and HMX. Two different ionization sources such as a conventional electrospray ionization (ESI) source and a chip-based static nano-ESI source were used to investigate the adduct ions of RDX and HMX. The ESI-MS analyses of two explosives in negative ion mode provide some adduct ions of RDX and HMX even without prior addition of their corresponding anions.

2-s2.0-85123680957,"In post-blast explosions, only trace amounts of residual explosives are present and their analysis is based on the identification of unreacted explosives. Exhibits from post-blast explosion scenes may be contaminated with interfering materials, thus cleanup procedures have to be used prior to the analysis stage. The type of explosive material involved can greatly assist the intelligence and investigation units in connecting different incidents, in connecting a specific suspect with a crime scene, and in tracking terrorists or other criminal activity. The detection of post-blast high explosives in the Israel Police laboratory is usually performed by extracting the exhibits with organic solvents (mainly acetone) and after evaporation of most of the solvent, injecting the concentrated liquid into a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument for analysis. A main challenge is that acetone dissolves many other materials such as fatty acids, plastic, oils, and so forth. These materials may be present in large amounts, which may cause a decrease in the resolution or sensitivity in the GC/MS, and, as a result, might screen the target explosive materials. In this paper, we present an effective, simple, and environmentally friendly procedure of extraction of post-blast high explosives using hot water followed by liquid-liquid extraction with a very small amount of organic solvent: dichloromethane.

The device uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and low-impedance transmission and reception circuits that include a dual supply class-D power amplifier powered by conventional batteries to ensure sufficient magnetic field excitation for mine detection. The pulse width modulation signals that are fed into the power amplifier have been designed to protect the low impedance transmit-receive switch circuit from the high voltage. The system has been tested successfully in the laboratory with 100g of explosive RDX at a distance of 10cm from the antenna, corresponding to a plausible anti-personal (AP) mine scenario. Detection was achieved with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) 2 in 2/3 of the time that a previous prototype required (120 sec). Moreover, the new device can detect RDX explosives with a measurement time and SNR comparable to mine detectors built with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, but at lower cost and smaller form factor. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Otagaki Y., Miyato Y., Barras J., Sato-Akaba H., Kosmas P.",57201736372;8586595000;7005867464;23996237200;6602644338;,"Development of a Low-Cost, Portable NQR Spectrometer for RDX Explosives Detection",2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,21,5,9260249,6922,6929,NA,5,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3038158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098796042&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2020.3038158&partnerID=40&md5=db0b52b008ba8714c0e228c23ecdf295,"Department of Engineering, King's College London, London, WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom; Department of Systems Innovation, Osaka University, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Japan","Otagaki, Y., Department of Engineering, King's College London, London, WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom; Miyato, Y., Department of Systems Innovation, Osaka University, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Japan; Barras, J., Department of Systems Innovation, Osaka University, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Japan; Sato-Akaba, H., Department of Systems Innovation, Osaka University, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Japan; Kosmas, P., Department of Engineering, King's College London, London, WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom",Dual supply class-D amplifier; low-impedance circuit; nuclear quadrupole resonance; portable system,Antennas; Bombs (ordnance); Costs; Explosives; Explosives detection; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Landmine detection; Nuclear quadrupole resonance; Power amplifiers; Voltage control; Class d power amplifiers; Commercial of the shelves; Conventional batteries; Mass production; Measurement time; Mine detections; Portable device; Transmitter power; Signal to noise ratio,"Otagaki, Y.; Department of Engineering, United Kingdom; email: yui.otagaki@kcl.ac.uk",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85101042171,"The dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50), as an outstanding representative of nitrogen-rich energetic salts, has recently attracted increasing interest due to its excellent performances. However, it is unclear about the photostability and degradation pathways of TKX-50 in aqueous solution. In this paper, the photostability and the degradation process of TKX-50 in aqueous solution have been comprehensively studied for the first time. TKX-50 can keep stable toward visible light. However, it presented a rapid degradation with rate constant of 0.0054 s−1 under 254-nm light irradiation. TKX-50 also demonstrated much faster photodegradation than traditional nitro explosives. Further, degradation products of TKX-50 were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrum with theoretical calculations. The photodegradation pathways are proposed that 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (BTO) anion of TKX-50 can been fragmented into the nitrile by losing N2 and HNO, and then hydroxylammonium (NH3OH+) from TKX-50 reacts with the nitrile through the nucleophilic addition. Besides as a solvent, water also may accelerate the photodegradation of TKX-50 probably by hydrolyzing the intermediary nitrile products. In a word, this study provides comprehensive understanding about the photostability of TKX-50 in aqueous solution, and it is helpful to study the photochemistry of other energetic ionic salts based on BTO. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chen J.-B., Yan T., Wang C., Gao R., Xu S., Fan G., Zhao X., Liu Y.",55908203900;57191480187;57208780491;36466424500;24492609800;55568138300;57203878446;27171434100;,The photostability and degradation pathways of TKX-50 as a representative of nitrogen-rich energetic salts in aqueous solution,2021,Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry,411,,113178,,,NA,6,10.1016/j.jphotochem.2021.113178,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101042171&doi=10.1016%2fj.jphotochem.2021.113178&partnerID=40&md5=5e04f76814c8c895348616fec250ec4a,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Department of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China; Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China","Chen, J.-B., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Yan, T., Department of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China; Wang, C., Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China; Gao, R., Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China; Xu, S., Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China; Fan, G., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Zhao, X., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China; Liu, Y., Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900, China",High-resolution mass spectrum; Nitrogen-rich energetic salts; Photochemistry; Photodegradation process; TKX-50,,"Chen, J.-B.; Institute of Chemical Materials, China; email: chenjianbo@caep.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The presence of UXO and the release of their chemical compounds can be of environmental concern. The complete and incomplete detonation of explosives can ignite vegetation fires that cause organics in the topsoil to burn, and therefore, impact the environmental fate of these compounds. The sorption and transport of two UXOs, HMX and RDX, were investigated in a surface soil that was previously exposed to a fire event. In addition, a control soil that had not been exposed to a fire event was used. The use of burned and unburned soil to simulate soil that has been directly impacted by the explosion of UXOs combined with the uniqueness of the soil properties in Hawaii represents the novelty of this study. The surface soil that had been previously exposed to a fire event showed greater adsorption than the control, which was possibly due to a reduction of macropores in the burned soil and the presence of fine charcoal particles. Regardless of the presence or absence of a fire event, HMX showed a greater sorption affinity than RDX. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Dalessio M., Lichwa J., Ray C.",35168819200;15071810700;35610547200;,Transport of explosive chemicals in fire-Affected hawaiian topsoil,2021,"Journal of Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste",25,1,6020006,,,NA,1,10.1061/(ASCE)HZ.2153-5515.0000567,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094200261&doi=10.1061%2f%28ASCE%29HZ.2153-5515.0000567&partnerID=40&md5=abdd52adf74d05266c18c7c466191555,"Water Resources Research Center, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States; Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States; Dept. of Civil Engineering, Univ. of Mississippi, 204 Carrier Hall, University, MS  38677, United States; Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln, Nebraska Water Center, 2021 Transformation Drive, Suite 3220, Lincoln, NE  68583-0979, United States","Dalessio, M., Water Resources Research Center, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Univ. of Mississippi, 204 Carrier Hall, University, MS  38677, United States; Lichwa, J., Water Resources Research Center, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States; Ray, C., Water Resources Research Center, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI  96822, United States, Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln, Nebraska Water Center, 2021 Transformation Drive, Suite 3220, Lincoln, NE  68583-0979, United States",,Charcoal; Detonation; Fire hazards; Ordnance; Soils; Background concentration; Environmental concerns; Environmental fate; Explosive chemicals; Military training; Sorption affinity; Unexploded ordnance; Vegetation fire; Fires; chemical compound; concentration (composition); contaminated land; explosion; explosive; pollutant transport; soil pollution; sorption; topsoil; Hawaii [United States]; United States,"Dalessio, M.; Water Resources Research Center, United States; email: matteo@olemiss.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Thus, it became the need of today’s era to understand the basics of explosion and factors affecting the explosion. Types of explosives are one of the important parameters which directly influences the impact of blast on any structural element. The term “TNT equivalence” is considered as the benchmark and is most commonly used to compare the performance of explosives with respect to reference explosive, i.e. trinitrotoluene (TNT). The main purpose of this study is to review TNT equivalence and the factors associated with it. The effect of charge geometry (i.e. spherical, flat, cylindrical, square etc.), confinement (close-in, intermediate or far ranges, etc.) and standoff distance on the peak overpressure and impulse are discussed in the present study as explosive energy and charge mass of the detonating material is related to equivalent weight of TNT. Moreover, effect of scaled distance of high explosives on TNT equivalent is also presented. Further, various numerical methods used to compute the TNT equivalents (TNTe) are reported for improved understanding of the TNT equivalence. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Shirbhate P.A., Goel M.D.",57216748526;54948545200;,A Critical Review of TNT Equivalence Factors for Various Explosives,2021,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,103,,,471,478,NA,3,10.1007/978-981-15-8138-0_36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097648131&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-8138-0_36&partnerID=40&md5=572ad96ab1ff609518cb80620d2f86c1,"Department of Applied Mechanics, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, 440 010, India","Shirbhate, P.A., Department of Applied Mechanics, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, 440 010, India; Goel, M.D., Department of Applied Mechanics, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, 440 010, India",Blast; Impulse; Peak overpressure; Shape charge; TNT,Benchmarking; Computational mechanics; Numerical methods; Terrorism; Detonating materials; Equivalent weight; Explosive energy; Peak overpressure; Scaled distances; Stand-off distance (SoD); Structural elements; Terrorist attacks; Explosives,"Shirbhate, P.A.; Department of Applied Mechanics, India; email: payalshirbhate@students.vnit.ac.in",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85105437726,"Experiments are carried out to determine the effects of particle size and mass loading on the free-field blast wave from spherical, constant volume metalized explosive charges. The charges are comprised of gelled nitromethane with uniformly embedded aluminum, magnesium, or glass particles. Particle sizes are varied over an order of magnitude with particle mass fractions up to 50%. Peak blast overpressures are directly measured within the fireball with piezoelectric pressure gauges and outside the fireball are inferred by tracking the velocity of the blast wave and using the Rankine–Hugoniot relation. With the addition of inert particles, the peak blast overpressure is initially mitigated, but then recovers in the far field. For charges with reactive particles, the particles react promptly with oxidizers in the detonation products and release energy as early as within the first few hundred microseconds in all cases. The particle energy release enhances the peak blast overpressures in the far field by up to twice the values for a constant volume charge of the baseline homogenous explosive. By plotting the peak blast overpressure decay as a function of energy-scaled distance, it is inferred that at least half of the particle energy release contributes to the blast overpressure in the far field of higher mass loadings, and nearly all of the particle energy for a particle mass fraction of 10%. For aluminum, the blast augmentation is not a systematic function of particle size. This observation implies that conventional models for particle combustion that depend on particle surface area are not appropriate for describing the rapid aluminum reaction that occurs in the extreme conditions within the detonation products, which influences the blast wave propagation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Pontalier Q., Loiseau J., Goroshin S., Zhang F., Frost D.L.",56247365400;35218840800;6602503996;57223747432;7101949362;,Blast enhancement from metalized explosives,2021,Shock Waves,31,3,,203,230,NA,8,10.1007/s00193-021-00994-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105437726&doi=10.1007%2fs00193-021-00994-z&partnerID=40&md5=0bc236cddb33588f3a675c94d0622c76,"McGill University, Macdonald Engineering Building, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H3A 0C3, Canada; Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Department, Royal Military College, 17 General Crerar Crescent, Kingston, ON  K7K 7B4, Canada; Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) - Suffield, PO Box 4000, Stn Main, Medicine Hat, AB, T1A 8K6, Canada","Pontalier, Q., McGill University, Macdonald Engineering Building, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H3A 0C3, Canada; Loiseau, J., Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Department, Royal Military College, 17 General Crerar Crescent, Kingston, ON  K7K 7B4, Canada; Goroshin, S., McGill University, Macdonald Engineering Building, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H3A 0C3, Canada; Zhang, F., Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) - Suffield, PO Box 4000, Stn Main, Medicine Hat, AB, T1A 8K6, Canada; Frost, D.L., McGill University, Macdonald Engineering Building, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H3A 0C3, Canada",Al/Mg particles; Blast wave enhancement; Mass fraction; Particle size; Particle–blast interaction; Reaction timescales,,"Pontalier, Q.; McGill University, Macdonald Engineering Building, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Canada; email: quentin.pontalier@mail.mcgill.ca",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85096216246,"There is a growing need for a continuous monitoring system that can detect explosives such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP) in the vapor phase at trace levels. TATP is an energetic material commonly used by terrorists in improvised explosive devices both as the initiator and the energetic material itself. TATP is still going largely undetected in many densely populated venues such as train stations and airports. No electronic trace detection system currently exists that is capable of continuously monitoring TATP, or its precursors, in the vapor phase. Recently, we developed a thermodynamic sensor that can detect TATP and other nitrogen-based explosives in the vapor phase at the ppb level. These ultrathin sensors showed unparalleled sensitivity and could even be operated at low enough powers to enable them to be deployed on drones. The sensor relies on specific oxidation-reduction reactions between the energetic molecules and metal oxide catalysts. Here, catalyst coated microheaters measure the heat effects associated with redox reactions occurring on the surface of the metal oxide catalyst. Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were achieved through implementation of ultrathin ( $8~\mu \text{m}$ thick) yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) as the substrate for the sensor platform. This reduction in the thermal mass combined with the catalytic amplification associated with Pd microheaters and optimized catalyst porosity enabled us to detect TATP in the vapor phase at unprecedented levels.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Ricci P.P., Gregory O.J.",57209273386;7003688576;,"Continuous Monitoring of TATP Using Ultrasensitive, Low-Power Sensors",2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,20,23,9137169,14058,14064,NA,5,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3008254,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096216246&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2020.3008254&partnerID=40&md5=ade38e07ecb3b271bc2c00354b5e38be,"URI Sensors and Surface Technology, Partnership Thin Film Laboratory, Kingston, RI, United States","Ricci, P.P., URI Sensors and Surface Technology, Partnership Thin Film Laboratory, Kingston, RI, United States; Gregory, O.J., URI Sensors and Surface Technology, Partnership Thin Film Laboratory, Kingston, RI, United States",Explosive vapor detection; palladium; TATP; thermal mass; YSZ,Catalysts; Explosives; Explosives detection; Heating equipment; Initiators (explosives); Metals; Microelectromechanical devices; Monitoring; Surface reactions; Trace analysis; Vapor phase epitaxy; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Yttrium metallography; Yttrium oxide; Zirconia; Continuous monitoring; Continuous monitoring systems; Enhanced sensitivity; Improvised explosive devices; Metal oxide catalysts; Trace detection systems; Triacetone triperoxide; Yttria-stabilized zirconias (YSZ); Redox reactions,"Ricci, P.P.; URI Sensors and Surface Technology, United States; email: pricci3@my.uri.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Particularly in field applications, ion mobility spectrometers (IMSs) are useful because of their extremely low detection limits at short measuring periods and their compact and robust design.

Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach to increase the resolving power of a drift time IMS without employing higher drift voltages and bulky power supplies. The so-called moving field IMS (MOF-IMS) presented here allows a more effective use of the available voltage because of a segmented drift region where only a small part is supplied with voltage.

2-s2.0-85076359103,"Analysis of explosive residues is of special interest in forensic science. It can be crucial for investigating acts of terrorism or robberies. Ion Chromatography (IC) is a standard technique used by many forensic labs in these cases. Due to the common nature of many explosives and the inherent dirtiness of samples from explosion scenes, sometimes inconclusive or false positive results are obtained by IC, making the identification of interferers extremely important. One possible source of interferer can be the sampling materials themselves, as investigated in this work. First of all, interferers from forensic swabs and syringe filters were evaluated, as these are commonly employed in explosive residue IC analysis. Among the 6 tested samples, only two syringe filters were considered free of interferers. Significant amounts (>0.2 mg/L) of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, and SO4 2- were found in all forensic swabs and two syringe filters. Then, some ordinary commercial materials, such as cotton swabs, cotton balls, and cotton discs were also tested, as they are often employed in a forensic routine, also. These also showed significant amounts (>0.2 mg/L) of Na+, K+, Cl−, NO3 −, and SO4 2-. However, the total concentration of interferers in ordinary commercial materials was lower than in the forensic swabs. Then the effectiveness of removing interferers by washing sampling (swabs, and cotton balls, rolls and disk) and pre-processing (syringe filters) materials was evaluated. This revealed that the interferers could be removed with at least three washes. The results indicated that the sampling materials used for explosion scene analysis should be carefully addressed in forensic analysis. First, by making a previous analysis of the sampling material, preferably prior to use, to evaluate the presence of interferers to ensure that only material free of interferers is used. When it is not possible to perform a prior analysis of sampling materials, they should be analyzed concomitantly with the samples from the post-blast residue in order to estimate the presence of interferers. This would reduce the risk of false positives. Additionally, when interferers are detected, washing can be employed for more reliable routine analysis. We suggest at least 3 wash cycles. This method could be used for ordinary commercial materials, which are cheap and easily obtained. © 2019","Mauricio F.G.M., Abritta V.R.M., de Lacerda Aquino R., Ambrósio J.C.L., Logrado L.P.L., Weber I.T.",57193544455;57212269395;57212267324;57212264389;56464160300;7102280478;,Evaluation of interferers in sampling materials used in explosive residue analysis by ion chromatography,2020,Forensic Science International,307,,109908,,,NA,3,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.109908,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076359103&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2019.109908&partnerID=40&md5=69cb2c26fdd6e9c454e891fe303667be,"Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF  70910-000, Brazil; National Institute of Criminalistics, Brazilian Federal Police, SAIS Quadra 07 Lote 23, Brasília, 70610-200, Brazil; Fundamental Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil","Mauricio, F.G.M., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF  70910-000, Brazil; Abritta, V.R.M., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF  70910-000, Brazil; de Lacerda Aquino, R., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF  70910-000, Brazil; Ambrósio, J.C.L., National Institute of Criminalistics, Brazilian Federal Police, SAIS Quadra 07 Lote 23, Brasília, 70610-200, Brazil; Logrado, L.P.L., National Institute of Criminalistics, Brazilian Federal Police, SAIS Quadra 07 Lote 23, Brasília, 70610-200, Brazil; Weber, I.T., Laboratory of Inorganic and Materials, University of Brasília, Asa Norte, Brasília, DF  70910-000, Brazil, Fundamental Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE  50670-901, Brazil",Explosive; Interferers; Ion chromatography; Sampling materials,chlorine; explosive; nitrate; potassium; sodium; sulfate; Article; chemical analysis; chromatography; concentration (parameter); false positive result; forensic science; ion chromatography; oxidation; priority journal; residue analysis; risk reduction; terrorism,"Weber, I.T.; LIMA, P.O.

Thin films are a commonly used tool for investigating the fundamental crystallization behavior in many systems, and the interfacial physics between a crystallizing species and the substrate can significantly affect many factors associated with the crystal growth process. In this work, atmospheric vapor deposition was used to prepare thin films of supercooled PETN droplets on the surfaces of copper, gold, and silicon. The gold and copper surfaces were prepared on silicon substrates using ultra-high vacuum vapor deposition. Crystallization of the supercooled PETN droplets was induced by scanning the surface of each substrate type with an atomic force microscope upon which crystallization occurred in the form of compact, circularly shaped dendrites reminiscent of spherulites. All three substrates were characterized relative to their respective surface roughness and surface energy. The surface energy was assessed from contact angle measurements with three liquids: water, ethylene glycol, and dodecane. High-resolution, time-lapse images of the crystal growth process were acquired under high magnification on each material surface, and the crystal growth rates were measured based on the radial distance of “ring” features that appeared in the crystal growth patterns after inducing changes in the substrate temperature. The growth rates were used to determine the Arrhenius activation energy of crystal growth on each surface, and the results indicate that there is a significant correlation between the surface energy and the crystallization behavior of the supercooled PETN droplets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fondren Z.T., Fondren N.S., McKenna G.B., Weeks B.L.",57210787887;57209745259;7102470949;7005023958;,Crystallization kinetics of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) thin films on various materials,2020,Applied Surface Science,522,,146350,,,NA,7,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146350,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084042017&doi=10.1016%2fj.apsusc.2020.146350&partnerID=40&md5=e5ff43b96df8670232b6a496c4f587eb,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States","Fondren, Z.T., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Fondren, N.S., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; McKenna, G.B., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States; Weeks, B.L., Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States",Contact angle; Crystal growth; Explosives; Kinetics; Surface energy; Thin films,Activation energy; Contact angle; Copper; Crystal growth; Crystallization kinetics; Drops; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Explosives; Interfacial energy; Substrates; Supercooling; Surface roughness; Thin films; Arrhenius activation energy; Crystal growth process; Crystallization behavior; High magnifications; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; Silicon substrates; Substrate temperature; Time lapse images; Vapor deposition,"Weeks, B.L.; Texas Tech University, Box 43103, United States; email: brandon.weeks@ttu.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85084656479,"The understanding of subsurface events that cannot be directly observed is dependent on the ability to relate surface-based observations to subsurface processes. This is particularly important for nuclear explosion monitoring, as any future clandestine tests will likely be underground. We collected ground-based lidar and optical imagery using remote, very-low-altitude unmanned aerial system platforms, before and after several underground high explosive experiments. For the lidar collections, we used a terrestrial lidar scanner to obtain high-resolution point clouds and create digital elevation models (DEMs). For the imagery collections, we used structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and a dense grid of surveyed ground control points to create high-resolution DEMs. Comparisons between the pre- and post-experiment DEMs indicate changes in surface topography that vary between explosive experiments with varying yield and depth parameters. Our work shows that the relationship between explosive yield and the extent of observable surface change differs from the standard scaled-depth-of-burial model. This suggests that the surface morphological change from underground high explosive experiments can help constrain the experiments' yield and depth, and may impact how such activities are monitored and verified. © 2020","Schultz-Fellenz E.S., Swanson E.M., Sussman A.J., Coppersmith R.T., Kelley R.E., Miller E.D., Crawford B.M., Lavadie-Bulnes A.F., Cooley J.R., Vigil S.R., Townsend M.J., Larotonda J.M.",36142298000;49061526600;7006864185;56344515300;14048329700;57203224918;57216782045;57215774014;57216781833;6701404581;57190257089;57216784893;,High-resolution surface topographic change analyses to characterize a series of underground explosions,2020,Remote Sensing of Environment,246,,111871,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111871,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084656479&doi=10.1016%2fj.rse.2020.111871&partnerID=40&md5=a4caf9baa440328182d82b071edb9cb3,"Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, United States; Coppersmith Consulting Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, United States; Civil and Environmental Consultants Inc., Nashville, TN, United States; Mission Support and Test Services, LLC, Las Vegas, NV, United States","Schultz-Fellenz, E.S., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Swanson, E.M., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Sussman, A.J., Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, United States; Coppersmith, R.T., Coppersmith Consulting Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, United States; Kelley, R.E., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Miller, E.D., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Crawford, B.M., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Lavadie-Bulnes, A.F., Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Cooley, J.R., Civil and Environmental Consultants Inc., Nashville, TN, United States; Vigil, S.R., Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, United States; Townsend, M.J., Mission Support and Test Services, LLC, Las Vegas, NV, United States; Larotonda, J.M., Mission Support and Test Services, LLC, Las Vegas, NV, United States",Change detection; Lidar; Nuclear explosion monitoring; Photogrammetry; Structure-from-motion; Underground explosions; Unmanned aerial systems,Antennas; Explosives; Nuclear explosions; Optical radar; Rock mechanics; Topography; Digital elevation model; Ground control points; Ground-based lidars; High resolution point clouds; Morphological changes; Structure from motion; Topographic changes; Unmanned aerial systems; Underground explosions; digital elevation model; explosion; ground control; laser method; lidar; nuclear explosion; photogrammetry; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle,"Schultz-Fellenz, E.S.; Earth and Environmental Sciences Division, United States; email: eschultz@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85081911182,"Ammonium nitrate fuel oil is an explosive mixture found in most antipersonnel landmines (APL) buried throughout the Colombian territory. During more than 50 years of internal conflict, the Colombian government has found that trained dogs are the most effective method to detect APL. However, the olfactive signature in ANFO is unknown and also if there are differences in detection related to the explosive manufacturing origin. Therefore, this work begins with the analytical validation of the method used to determine ammonia, in its derivatized form as carbamate, released by home-made ANFO using HS-SPME-GC-FID. Once validated, the method was used to identify ammonia and other organic volatile compounds present in ANFO, under laboratory and simulated field conditions. The validation process includes the evaluation of the optimum conditions for the derivation and extraction of butylcarbamate, the determination of the working ranges with linear response in FID, the limits of detection and quantification, the sensitivity, and the precision. The results of the validation established linearity and sensitivity in a concentration between 20 and 120 mg/L, as well as low limits of detection and quantification of 6.4 and 21.4 mg/L, respectively.

Owing to the inherent heterogeneity of soils, the determination of which soil components are responsible for the adsorption and retention of a particular contaminant remains a challenge. In the current study, we consider several thermodynamic adsorption states in order to predict whether or not 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) or 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) would be either a ground-water contaminant or a soil contaminant. In order to reduce the complexity, we only consider two metal oxides (hematite and corundum) that are commonly found in arid regions. We have shown that TNT and DNAN bind favorably across all concentrations, temperatures, and surface hydration considered for α-Al2O3; however, only TNT was found to be bound for α-Fe2O3. Our results indicate that for soils rich in iron oxides, DNAN would be a ground-water contaminant.  © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

2-s2.0-85082958114,"The reaction rate of an explosive – also called detonation velocity – is the easiest parameter to measure, and also one of the most important in characterizing the process of detonation front propagation in a 1D approach. This paper presents some peculiarities that were observed during the testing of our passive/active optical methods to measure detonation velocity. Both methods were tested using bare optic fiber probes and optic fiber probes protected with a stainless steel tube. The active optical method uses a laser with a wavelength of 660 nm, and the recording system contains a window filter that blocks any radiation outside the wavelength range of 650 to 665 nm. A plastic-bonded explosive based on PETN (seismoplast) was used to test both experimental methods. For rectangular cross-section charges using the passive optical method with the two different probes, the detonation velocities obtained ranged from 7233 to 7324 m/s, with standard deviations between 1.1 and 6.0 %; for the active optical method, the experimental results for detonation velocity varied between 7261 and 7351 and were obtained with a standard deviation of 0.6 to 1.7 %. © 2020 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85080091472,"In order to solve the sloughing problem of explosives in upward blast holes, a novel underground mining emulsion explosive with thickening microcapsules was developed. The microcapsules in the emulsion explosive would be damaged by high-speed shearing at the moment of entering the blast hole, releasing their internal thickening agents to the emulsion explosive in the blast holes. These thickening agents were evenly distributed with a linear network structure in the emulsion explosive to make it thickened in the hole. The microcapsules were spherical and could encapsulate the thickening agent effectively, and the viscosity of the emulsion matrix with 2 mass % of them was close to that of the reference emulsion matrix at ca. 127.9 Pa s. Experimental results of TG-DSC and detonation performance showed that the novel underground mining emulsion explosive had a good thermal stability and its detonation velocity was 5133 m s−1 and still up to 4618 m s−1 after storing at the temperature of −20 °C for 12 h. The novel underground mining emulsion explosive with thickening microcapsules not only achieved the goal of thickening in the blast holes, but also had excellent detonation performance and low-temperature resistance capability. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85090181717,"The work presented here follows several others in investigating what capabilities, if any, ambient mass spectrometry might have toward the analysis of compounds commonly associated with smokeless propellant powders. This family of instrumental techniques has attracted curiosity from the field of forensic science due to its desirable properties such as rapid collection of information-rich data, combined with minimal requirements for sample mass and preparation. Experiments were conducted with a """"Direct Sample Analysis"""" ion source integrated with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The ionization behaviors of nitroglycerin, methyl and ethyl centralite, akardite, diphenylamine, nitrosodiphenylamine, and nitrated diphenylamine derivatives were investigated specifically, with accurate-mass data presented for each. Diphenylamine standards were used to demonstrate the performance of this instrument, which exhibited good response linearity across 1 order of magnitude and sub-nanogram detection limits. Thirty smokeless powder extracts, recovered from ammunition potentially in circulation within Australia, were analyzed to determine whether the technique is appropriate for rapid analysis of smokeless powder particles. Results demonstrated that the technique might be applied to compare individual particles with each other or to a database. Such a capability may be of value in the examination of explosive devices containing smokeless powder, postblast residues therefrom, or muzzle discharge from a close-range shooting. However, when efforts were made to detect residues from the hands of a volunteer shooter, only some returned positive results, and a high background signal from the sample collection stub indicates that detection using this instrument is thus far insufficiently reliable. © 2020 Springer New York LLC.

2-s2.0-85089081652,"Forensic scientists must be able to recover traces of any original explosive materials not consumed in the detonation, in a careful controlled manner to aid a crime reconstruction. In current sampling techniques, the collection efficiency of post-blast residue is highly variable and often dependent on the swabbing materials and solvent systems used. To address these method limitations, this study presents a gelatine-based sampling medium and assesses its capabilities for the collection of ammonium nitrate. Common surfaces were spotted with a known concentration of ammonium nitrate, the unset gel applied, allowed to set, and then peeled from the surface. The gel was dissolved, and solid phase extraction employed to isolate the target explosive compound and remove the constituents of the gel. The eluate was concentrated and subsequently analysed and quantified. Overall, the gel formulation was able to collect ammonium nitrate from all of the test surfaces, with recoveries ranging from 0.1% to 61.7%. This study presents a gelatine-based formulation that has the potential to become a valuable asset in the forensic tool kit for the collection of explosive traces. A key attribute of the gel is that it offers an alternative recovery tool to conventional swabbing and solvent extraction methods. © 2020 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","Amaral M.A., Yasin S., Gibson A.P., Morgan R.M.",57216917074;57218399032;57188584733;57194780985;,Sampling of explosive residues: The use of a gelatine-based medium for the recovery of ammonium nitrate,2020,Science and Justice,60,6,,531,537,NA,4,10.1016/j.scijus.2020.07.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089081652&doi=10.1016%2fj.scijus.2020.07.007&partnerID=40&md5=f7756475b808246eb580aa0e0808c8e6,"Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; School of Applied Science, London South Bank University, 103 Borough Road, London, SE1 0AA, United Kingdom; Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London, Central House, London, WC1E 0NN, United Kingdom","Amaral, M.A., Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Yasin, S., School of Applied Science, London South Bank University, 103 Borough Road, London, SE1 0AA, United Kingdom; Gibson, A.P., Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London, Central House, London, WC1E 0NN, United Kingdom; Morgan, R.M., Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom, Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom",Evidence recovery; Gelatine; Post-blast analysis; Trace evidence,ammonium nitrate; copper; explosive; gel; gelatin; glass; hydrogel; ammonium nitrate; explosive; nitric acid derivative; solvent; Article; controlled study; solid phase extraction; surface property; wood; human; Explosive Agents; Humans; Nitrates; Solvents,"Amaral, M.A.; Department of Security and Crime Science, 35 Tavistock Square, United Kingdom; email: mark.amaral.14@ucl.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85088861465,"The detection of trace amounts of explosives in the vapor phase is of great importance. Preconcentration of the analyte is a useful technique to lower the detection limit of existing sensors. A nanoporous silica (pSiO2) substrate was evaluated as a preconcentrator for gas-phase 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB), a volatile detection taggant added by law to plastic explosives. After collection in pSiO2, the DMNB vapor was thermally desorbed at 70 °C into a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry sorbent tube. This was analyzed for the total mass of DMNB collected in pSiO2. The loading time and loading temperature of pSiO2 were varied systematically between 15 and 60 min and 5-20 °C, respectively. The preconcentrator's performance was compared to that of a nonporous substrate of the same material as a control. The collection efficiency of pSiO2 was calculated as approximately 20% of the total DMNB that passed over it in 30 min, at a concentration of 0.5 ppm in N2 carrier gas. It had enhancement factors compared to the nonporous substrate of 12 and 16 for 0.5 and 4.1 ppm DMNB, respectively, under the same conditions. No advantage was found with cooling pSiO2 below room temperature during the loading phase, which removes any need for a cooling system to aid preconcentration. The low desorption temperature of 70 °C is an advantage over other preconcentration systems, although a higher temperature could decrease the desorption time.

2-s2.0-85086825508,"The current research effort demonstrates the ultrasonic-assisted synthesis of highly fluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of ∼5 nm diameter. First, acid pyrolysis with ultrasonic hydrothermal co-cutting breaks down the coarse graphite into nanometric graphene sheets (GS) and graphene oxide sheets (GOS) with oxygen-rich functionalities. These functionalities were then used to break GOS into graphene oxide nanofibers (GONFs) and graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs). Finally, upon reduction, GOQDs lose oxygen linkages to produce fluorescent GQDs (quantum yield up to 27%). The as-developed GQDs were characterized with detailed optical and spectral studies through UV, PL, FTIR, TEM, AFM, XPS, XRD and other techniques. Notably, the synthesized GQDs were catalytically active to serve as a ratiometric fluorescence switch on-off probe for the reduction of toxic nitrophenols. Moreover, the GQDs detected nitrophenol derivatives at lower concentrations than previously reported analytical values. During the real sample analysis of spiked industrial water and exposed soil samples, a high selectivity and sensitivity of the applied method was achieved with a recovery of 99.7% to 101.3% at spiked concentrations of 400 nM to 100 nM, respectively.

The permeability of PBX 9502 was found to be unmeasurably low (of the same order of magnitude as PTFE) with gas transport being diffusion-dominated. Secondly, a pressure vessel experiment was developed to measure quasi-static and dynamic gas generation as the explosive was heated to self-ignition (cookoff). The gas generation results and the permeability/diffusivity findings provide evidence that PBX 9502 remains impermeable until seconds prior to self-ignition. At ignition, internal void-pressure drives macro-scale cracking and the sample becomes uniformly incorporated in the following deconsolidating deflagration. These results are discussed within the context of previous observations of pressure-dependent cookoff behavior of PBX 9502 and provide a more complete description of thermal damage evolution in this explosive composition. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85085296261,"In this paper, the solubility of 5,5′-bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-2,2′-bis(1,3,4-oxadiazole) (TKX-55) was first determined by a dynamic laser monitoring at T = (293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15, 313.15, 318.15, 323.15, 328.15 and 333.15) K in fourteen pure solvents, including nitrobenzene (NB), methylethylketone (MEK), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), methoxybenzene (MOB), ethenyl acetate (VAC), 1,2-propanediol (PDO), cyclohexanone (CYC), epichlorohydrin (ECH), 1-butanol (NBA), n-butyl acrylate (BA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tributyl phosphate (TBP) and 2-butanol (IBA), under atmospheric pressure (P = 0.1 MPa). Besides, supersolubility as well as the metastable zone width of TKX-55 in PDO, BA, DMSO and IBA was determined by the dynamic laser monitoring method. The experimental results showed that the solubility of TKX-55 in fourteen pure solvents increases with increasing temperature and the metastable zone width decreases with increasing temperature. The metastable zone width is approximately 2.49 K–43.26 K. In addition, in order to improve the applicability of the solubility, the modified Apelblat equation, λh equation, the polynomial empirical equation, van't Hoff equation and NRTL equation were used to correlate the solubility data of TKX-55, and the results showed that all models can give a satisfactory correlation. The average root-mean-square deviation (102RMSD) values were 1.71, 8.91, 2.33, 6.12 and 3.30, respectively. Moreover, Hansen solubility parameter was used for explaining the solubility order of TKX-55 in selected solvents, the consequences showed that solubility order of TKX-55 resulted from the comprehensive function of several solubility parameters. The solubility parameter of Δδt between TKX-55 and solvents reached from 1.27 MPa0.5 to 15.28 MPa0.5. Furthermore, three kinds of thermodynamic properties of the mixing enthalpy (ΔmixH), the mixing entropy (ΔmixS) and the mixing Gibbs energy (ΔmixG) of TKX-55 in selected solvents were calculated by NRTL equation and the results turned out that the dissolution process was spontaneous. Besides, thermal properties of TKX-55 were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the melting temperature and the fusion enthalpy were 640.65 K and 19.60 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Finally, solubility values and thermodynamic relations of TKX-55 in fourteen pure solvents would be invoked as fundamental data and models regarding the purification process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Zhang T.-W., Li Y.-X., Cao D.-L., Liu Y.-Z., He J.-Y., Zou C.-L.",57216931285;7502093028;8231530500;57216931970;57216921706;57216921231;,Experimental study and thermodynamic modeling of a novel heat-resistant explosive in different mono solvents,2020,Journal of Molecular Liquids,311,,113056,,,NA,6,10.1016/j.molliq.2020.113056,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085296261&doi=10.1016%2fj.molliq.2020.113056&partnerID=40&md5=3f6bf95d3fc4249e44491ec57a30df76,"School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China","Zhang, T.-W., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Li, Y.-X., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Cao, D.-L., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Liu, Y.-Z., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; He, J.-Y., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China; Zou, C.-L., School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, 030051, China","5,5′-Bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-2,2′-bis(1,3,4-oxadiazole); Correlation; Metastable zone width; Solubility; Thermodynamic properties","Atmospheric pressure; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Dimethylformamide; Enthalpy; Mixing; Organic solvents; Solubility; Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Hansen solubility parameters; Heat-resistant explosives; Increasing temperatures; Metastable zone width; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Root mean square deviations; Solubility parameters; Temperature","Li, Y.-X.; School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, China; email: liyongxiang@nuc.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85094983243,"In Australia, party sparklers are commonly used to initiate or prepare inorganic based homemade explosives (HMEs) as they are the most easily accessible and inexpensive pyrotechnic available on the market. As sparkler residue would be encountered in cases involving these types of devices, the characterisation and source determination of the residue would be beneficial within a forensic investigation. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the potential of using trace elemental profiling coupled with chemometric and other statistical techniques to link a variety of different sparklers to their origin. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentration of 50 elements in 48 pre-blast sparkler samples from eight sparkler brands/classes available in Australia. Extracting ground-up sparkler residue in 10% nitric acid for 24 hours was found to give the most reliable quantification. The collected data were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualise the distribution of the sample data and explore whether the sparkler samples could be classified into their respective brands. ANOVA based feature selection was used to remove elements that did not largely contribute to the separation between classes. This resulted in the development of a 7-elemental profile, consisting of V, Co, Ni, Sr, Sn, Sb, W, which could be used to correctly classify the samples into eight distinct groups. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was subsequently used to construct a discriminant model using four out of six samples from each class. The model successfully classified 100% of the samples to their correct sparkler brand. The model also correctly matched 100% of the remaining samples to the correct class. This demonstrates the potential of using trace elemental analysis and chemometrics to correctly identify and discriminate between party sparklers.  © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","D'Uva J.A., Detata D., May C.D., Lewis S.W.",57215587252;55537850000;26534775600;7404038754;,Investigations into the source attribution of party sparklers using trace elemental analysis and chemometrics,2020,Analytical Methods,12,41,,4939,4948,NA,7,10.1039/d0ay01319f,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094983243&doi=10.1039%2fd0ay01319f&partnerID=40&md5=bde5b9a0400df0f2a449a4bb2229df0b,"School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia; Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia; ChemCentre Manning Road, Bentley, Perth, WA  6102, Australia","D'Uva, J.A., School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia, Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia; Detata, D., ChemCentre Manning Road, Bentley, Perth, WA  6102, Australia; May, C.D., ChemCentre Manning Road, Bentley, Perth, WA  6102, Australia; Lewis, S.W., School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia, Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA  6845, Australia",,Discriminant analysis; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Nitric acid; Trace analysis; Discriminant models; Forensic investigation; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (ICPMS); Linear discriminant analysis; Source attribution; Source determinations; Statistical techniques; Trace elemental analysis; Explosives,"Lewis, S.W.; School of Molecular and Life Sciences, GPO Box U1987, Australia; email: s.lewis@curtin.edu.au",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85092398747,"Mid-infrared (MIR) laser spectroscopy measurements coupled with multivariate analysis (MVA) routines were applied to detection and classification of high explosives (HEs) deposited on aluminum and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene substrates. An MIR quantum cascade laser (QCL) was optically coupled to a grazing angle probe (QCL-GAP) mount to operate in diffuse reflectance mode at an incidence angle of 82 deg from the surface normal. The experimental conditions enabled reflection-absorption infrared reflectance spectroscopy of the laser light by the surface deposits of HEs and allowed obtaining spectra with high signal-to-noise ratios in a very short time. This optical arrangement permitted collecting data for identifying the vibrational signatures of the HEs to be detectable even at low surface concentrations. The HEs used included pentaerythritol tetranitrate, 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine, and 2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine. Using principal components analysis, 100% of the HE samples deposited on the reflective and nonreflective substrate were correctly classified, avoiding false-positive responses in the analyses. The combination of QCL-GAP spectroscopy with MVA presented will also allow obtaining highly confident detections/identification of hazardous materials and other chemical/biological agents residing on both reflective and nonreflective surfaces.

Normal explosives detection is mainly targeted for nitroaromatic compounds, however, ntiramine explosive is used more widely due to its outstanding performance.

And 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) templated MIPC was also made to discriminate not only nitramines but also nitrobenzene explosives.

We present several vented and sealed experiments from 2.5 mg to 4.2 kg of Comp-B3 in several configurations. We measured pressure, spatial temperature, and ignition time. Some experiments included borescope images obtained during both vented and sealed decomposition. We observed the TNT melt, the suspension of RDX particles in the melt, bubble formation caused by RDX decomposition, and bubble-induced mixing of the suspension. The RDX suspension did not completely dissolve, even as temperatures approached ignition. Our results contrast with published measurements of RDX solubility in hot TNT that suggest RDX would be completely dissolved at these high temperatures. These different observations are attributed to sample purity. We did not observe significant movement of the two-phase mixture until decomposition gases formed bubbles.

2-s2.0-85084678432,"Aquarium tests of cylindrical high-explosive charges provide optical data of the detonation front velocity and shape, propagation of the shock wave in the surrounding water, and expansion rates of the detonation products behind the front. Data from aquarium experiments is often used for calibration of reactive burn models based on phenomenological equations of state (EOS) and reaction rate laws. This paper presents a multimaterial numerical modeling framework to solve the 2D axisymmetric reactive Euler equations for high-explosive aquarium tests, in particular for ammonium nitrate - fuel oil (ANFO) explosives. An extension of the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) is used to handle the dynamic material interfaces for the ANFO explosion products, the charge-confining material (polymethyl methacrylate PMMA), and the surrounding water. This study analyzes the sensitivity of calculations (both computational efficiency and numerical accuracy) to different algorithms for the material interface models including the original GFM versus Riemann solver-based strategies. A novel method for defining the left and right states in the interfacial Riemann problem eliminates the need for sorting or nodal interpolation during the projection along the material interface. Numerical tests indicate that populating the interface node values using the Riemann solution mitigate the overheating error observed in steady-state calculations. Solution convergence and computational efficiency are explored as a function of the spatial and temporal order of the schemes. Results from the computational model with analytical equations of state and fitted reaction rate parameters show very good quantitative agreement with experimentally observed detonation front velocity, reaction products expansion, and shock wave propagation in the surrounding water for a cylindrical ANFO charge encased in PMMA. The proposed modeling framework, in conjunction with experimental tests, provides a reliable tool to assess equations of state and reaction rate expressions for reactive burn models of confined high explosives. © 2020","Lozano E., Jackson G.S., Petr V.",57191292101;57216790733;6701623424;,An Eulerian multimaterial framework for simulating high-explosive aquarium tests,2020,Computers and Fluids,205,,104524,,,NA,3,10.1016/j.compfluid.2020.104524,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084678432&doi=10.1016%2fj.compfluid.2020.104524&partnerID=40&md5=83c21c09ea834f5e48706719b65e3c59,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States; Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, 80401, United States","Lozano, E., Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States; Jackson, G.S., Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, 80401, United States; Petr, V., Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, 80401, United States",Detonation; Ghost fluid method; Reactive burn; Shock capturing,Detonation; Efficiency; Equations of state; Interface states; Interfaces (materials); Polymethyl methacrylates; Reaction rates; Shock waves; Wave propagation; Analytical equations; High explosive charge; Phenomenological equations; Quantitative agreement; Reaction rate expressions; Reaction rate parameters; Reactive burn model; Steady state calculations; Computational efficiency,"Lozano, E.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States; email: lozano@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85072598852,"Compounds which are rich in boron and nitrogen have the potential to find application as high-energy material. In the present article quantum-chemical calculations (DFT B3LYP/6-311 + G*) of geometric and electronic structures, enthalpies of formation, highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies and the detonation properties of 22 molecules of carboranyl tetrazoles were carried out. The method of the estimation of enthalpies of formation of carboranyl tetrazoles based on full energies of the molecules and semi empirical parameters for solid carbon (graphite) and boron was proposed. The enthalpies of formation of carboranyl tetrazoles were evaluated. Theoretical terahertz frequencies for potential high-energy density materials (HEDMs) were computed which allows the opportunity for the remote detection of these compounds. According to the results of calculations the most promising HEDMs among studied compounds were found to be 9,12-bis(2-(5-phenyl-tetrazol-2-yl)propyl)-o-carborane; 9,10-bis(2-(5-phenyl-tetrazol-2-yl)propyl)-m-carborane; 5,5’-(butan-1,4-diyl)-{9,12-bis[2-(tetrazol-2-yl)prop-1-yl]-о-carborane}. Based on the calculated frontier molecular orbital energy gap these energetic materials are even less impact sensitive than classical diaminotrinitrobenzene (DATB) and trinitroaniline (TNA). These compounds are characterized by the maxima magnitudes of the evaluation of the enthalpies of formation (EOF) and can be considered as promising HEDMs as their EOF values are notably higher than those of well-known trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexogen (RDX, Research Department eXplosive). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Borisov Y.A., Makarenkov A.V., Kiselev S.S., Kononova E.G., Ponomaryov A.B., Budnik M.I., Ol'shevskaya V.A.",35509889100;36537612300;56816488000;7003420563;8287615800;57290401000;7003608433;,Prediction of energetic properties of carboranyl tetrazoles based on DFT study,2020,Materials Chemistry and Physics,240,,122209,,,NA,8,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2019.122209,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072598852&doi=10.1016%2fj.matchemphys.2019.122209&partnerID=40&md5=1df33a1049def3617a1bfa57a27eb8ce,"A.N.

Such adsorbents combine characteristics of nonpolar carbon phase and polar inorganic matrix. Both porosity and texture of composites substantially depend on applied carbon precursor, inorganic component and pyrolysis conditions. Novel carbon/alumina composites were prepared using co-polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer with fumed Al2O3 and subsequent pyrolysis of derived materials in inert atmosphere at 800 °C. Morphological and structural characteristics of as-obtained initial polymeric and carbon-inorganic nanocomposites were studied using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption methods, and temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry. The experimental results showed that filler Al2O3 acting as catalyst has significant influence on the resorcinol-formaldehyde polycondensation reaction and further pyrolysis step, therefore affects the structure of carbon-inorganic composites that is evidenced by the changes of specific surface area and porosity. It was shown that the porosity and texture of prepared composites substantially influenced the adsorption/desorption steps of explosives from aqueous samples.

To study the effects of polymerization on the decomposition of PTX, the reaction processes of PTX at different conditions were simulated by quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics methods. In this paper, the effects of polymerization on the decomposition of PTX were studied in terms of species information, reaction path of PTX, bond formation and bond cleavage, evolution of small molecules and clusters, and kinetic parameters at different stages. The results show that under the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, the initial reaction path of unimolecular PTX in the thermal decomposition is mainly the cleavage of C−NO2 bonds. At the same time, there are many polymerization reactions in thermal decomposition process, which may greatly affect the reaction rate and path. The higher the degree of polymerization, the larger equilibrium value of potential energy, the less energy release of thermal decomposition. Compared with the activation energy of other explosives, the activation energy of PTX is higher than that of β-HMX and lower than that of TNT. © 2020 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85088841803,"Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) is a halogen-free green oxidizer, which is widely used in energetic materials because of its positive oxygen balance and low characteristic signal. However, ADN is easy to absorb moisture, which affects its storage and safety performances. It is of great significance to study the effect of water on its thermal decomposition mechanism. In this paper, the thermal decomposition processes of the ADN with water contents of 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % are simulated by large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The reaction pathway and the evolution of the main products are analyzed in detail. The results show that the ADN is not stable and decompose easily, namely ADN (Formula presented.) NH3(NH4)+HN3O4(N3O4). The H2O has a significant effect on the thermal decomposition of the ADN. The water contents of 2 % and 5 % can better promote the decomposition of the ADN and the degree of decomposition is also more thorough. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85146294015,"Shock-to-detonation transition profiles of PBX 9502 explosive are analyzed to develop a rate law for shock acceleration. The shock motion profiles are seen to follow a common trend in the shock acceleration–velocity frame, aside from an early time transient that is dependent on the initiating shock strength. The duration of the early time transient is seen to correlate with the initial shock strength. The common shock acceleration profile is seen to be Arrhenius-like with respect to the local particle velocity or pressure. A dual-rate pressure-dependent Arrhenius-type rate law is developed with the duration of the early rate set by the initial shock strength. The rate law is able to predict the shock motion for all tests well in both particle velocity and pressure space. In addition to directly measuring commonalities in the acceleration profiles of the experimental shock motion, this work provides insight into the functional form of the reaction rate laws for this TATB-based high explosive. The rate law also supports the concept that shock-driven reaction in heterogenous high explosives is driven by localized ignition and growth of hotspots. © 2019",Jackson S.I.,7402695193;,A pressure- or velocity-dependent acceleration rate law for the shock-to-detonation transition process in PBX 9502 high explosive,2020,Combustion and Flame,213,,,98,106,NA,2,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.11.036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146294015&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.11.036&partnerID=40&md5=99d36660a483d7c0bc0feb7252d75f2a,"Shock and Detonation Physics (M-9), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Jackson, S.I., Shock and Detonation Physics (M-9), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Detonation; Detonation reaction rate; High explosive; SDT; Shock-to-detonation transition,Cerenkov counters; Reaction rates; Velocity control; Detonations reaction rate; High explosives; PBX 9502; Pressure dependent; Rate laws; SDT; Shock acceleration; Shock strength; Shock to detonation transitions; Time transient; Detonation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85084379996,"It is well known that imidazoles, possessing two or more nitro substituents, are potential candidates for highly energetic explosives with detonation parameters comparable to those of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane. 4,4′,5,5′-Tetranitro-2,2′-bi-imidazole (TNBI) is a typical imidazole explosive with energy equivalent to that of RDX but suffers from low sensitivity (impact sensitivity 7 J). 1,1′-Diamino-4,4′,5,5′-tetranitro-2,2′-biimidazole (DATNBI), a derivative of TNBI, possesses two -NH2 groups and has a higher detonation velocity (9063 m s-1) and lower impact sensitivity of 15 J, which indicates great potential for future applications. Examination of the thermal decomposition mechanism and kinetics of TNBI and DATNBI gives a more comprehensive view of the influence that the -NH2 group has on the sensitivity and storage safety of the energetic explosive-based TNBI molecular skeleton. Herein, the thermal decomposition mechanism is studied, showing that detachment of -NH2 groups from DATNBI generates 1-diamino-4,4′,5,5′-tetranitro-2,2′-biimidazole (ATNBI) and TNBI and induces self-decomposition. Although the decomposition peak temperature of DATNBI is significantly lower than that of TNBI at the same heating rate; its self-accelerating decomposition temperature (50 kg) is only 4 K lower. Therefore, the -NH2 group displays good ability of reducing sensitivity but has no influence on storage safety of DATNBI. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Zhao C., Zhang Z., Yu Q., Yang F., Fan G., Yu K.",15761458500;57202764201;57191500663;57193121086;55568138300;55842305300;,Comparative Study of the Decomposition Mechanism and Kinetics of Biimidazole-Based Energetic Explosives,2020,Journal of Physical Chemistry A,124,18,,3672,3678,NA,4,10.1021/acs.jpca.0c01820,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084379996&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpca.0c01820&partnerID=40&md5=c81c8621f65b07f89a0e61b6d9230a42,"Institute of Chemical Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), P.O.

2-s2.0-85090178621,"The Department of Defense has developed new explosive formulations in which traditionally used cyclic nitramines such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) have been updated with the insensitive munition (IM) 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN). Understanding combined degradation of both compounds at explosive-contaminated sites will allow remediation approaches that simultaneously target both contaminants. DNAN reduction in the presence of RDX was evaluated in abiotic experiments using substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and superstoichiometric concentrations of ferrous iron and anthrahydroquinone disulfonate within a pH range from 7.0 to 9.0. Biological degradation was investigated in resting cell suspensions of Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15, a model Fe(III)-reducing Bacteria. Cells were amended into anoxic tubes buffered at pH 7.0, with initial 100 μM DNAN and 40-50 μM RDX. In both abiotic and biological experiments, the DNAN was reduced through the intermediate 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline or 4-methoxy-3-nitroaniline to 2,4-diaminoanisole. In biological experiments, the RDX was reduced to form methylenedinitramine, formaldehyde (HCHO), and ammonium (NH4+). Cells were able to reduce both DNAN and RDX most readily in the presence of extracellular electron shuttles and/or Fe(III). DNAN degradation (abiotic and biotic) was faster than degradation of RDX, suggesting that the reduction of IMs will not be inhibited by cyclic nitramines, but degradation dynamics did change in mixtures when compared to singular compounds.

Then the variation rules of mass, surface micro-topography, mechanical properties, thermal decomposition performance, detonation velocity and mechanical sensitivity of the samples before and after accelerated aging tests for different durations were measured. Then the variables of the samples that before and after accelerated aging tests for different durations, will be measured, these variables including the variation rules of mass, surface micro-topography, mechanical properties, thermal decomposition performance, detonation velocity, and mechanical sensitivity. The PBX columns showed an acceptable mass loss of less than 1%, after accelerated aging tests. The surface of the PBX samples became more and more uneven as the aging duration prolonged, which was in a good agreement with the order of mass loss. Moreover, the tensile strength, the thermal stability, the detonation velocity and the mechanical sensitivity of the samples were not significantly affected by the aging process, suggesting that the PBXs remained valid after an accelerated aging test at 60°C for 60 days. A further estimation using the modified Arrhenius equation revealed that the storage life at ambient temperature (20°C) of the HNIW-based PBXs was over 10 years, which satisfies the application demands for explosives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Zhou M.-N., Chen S.-S., Zou H.-M., Wang J.-F., Chen K., Yu Y.-H., Zhang G.-Y., Li J.-X., Chen M.-L.",57205130851;7410263291;57191754673;56503575300;56861445100;56864736100;56159166200;57206962796;57203626690;,Investigation on the thermal decomposition performance and long-term storage performance of HNIW-based PBXs through accelerated aging tests,2020,Journal of Energetic Materials,38,1,,68,82,NA,7,10.1080/07370652.2019.1663564,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073785275&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1663564&partnerID=40&md5=d17ecd6b33973727e92a523a89cf9d77,"School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Research Institute of Energetic Materials Branch, Gansu Yin′guang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd, Baiyin, China; 2nd Project Department, China Wanbao Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China","Zhou, M.-N., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Chen, S.-S., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Zou, H.-M., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, Research Institute of Energetic Materials Branch, Gansu Yin′guang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd, Baiyin, China; Wang, J.-F., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Chen, K., School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Yu, Y.-H., 2nd Project Department, China Wanbao Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China; Zhang, G.-Y., Research Institute of Energetic Materials Branch, Gansu Yin′guang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd, Baiyin, China; Li, J.-X., Research Institute of Energetic Materials Branch, Gansu Yin′guang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd, Baiyin, China; Chen, M.-L., Research Institute of Energetic Materials Branch, Gansu Yin′guang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd, Baiyin, China",accelerated aging test; HNIW; Long-term storage performance; polymer bonded explosive (PBX); storage life; thermal decomposition,,"Zou, H.-M.; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, China; email: shevchenkozou@sina.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85088047727,"Highly effective sensing of nitro explosives plays an extremely important role in homeland security and counter-terrorism. In this work, a BN-doped aggregation induced emission (AIE) probe SN-1 was synthesized and subsequently characterized.

In addition, an electron rich phenothiazine probe SN-2 was also prepared to probe the response to the nitro explosives via photo-induced electron transfer. The two probes were combined to construct a fluorescence sensor array for the successful distinction of five nitro explosives.

2-s2.0-85087652002,"Bacterial reaction centers (BRC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides were found to accelerate, about 100-fold, the reaction between tetryl (2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethylnitramine) explosive and n-lauryl-N-N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) that results in the formation of picric acid-like product with characteristic UV–VIS absorption spectrum with peaks at 345 and 415 nm. Moreover, this product also affects the spectra of BRC cofactors in the NIR spectral region and stabilizes the conformational changes associated with slow charge recombination. The evolution of the NIR absorption changes correlated with the kinetics of the product formation. Comparison between the wild-type and the R26 carotenoid-less strain indicates that tetryl-LDAO reaction is roughly five times faster for R26, which allows for identifying the carotenoid binding site as the optimal reaction site. Another, less-defined reaction site is located in the BRC’s hydrophobic cavity. These effects are highly selective for tetryl and not observed for several other widespread nitric explosives; slowed-down charge recombination allows for distinguishing between tetryl and QB-site herbicides. The current limit of detection is in the ppb range or ~ 100 nM. Details of the molecular mechanisms of the reactions and perspectives of using these effects in bioassays or biosensors for explosives detection are also discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Modafferi D., Zazubovich V., Kálmán L.",56659819600;6701853229;7003633751;,Bound detergent molecules in bacterial reaction centers facilitate detection of tetryl explosive,2020,Photosynthesis Research,145,2,,145,157,NA,4,10.1007/s11120-020-00770-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087652002&doi=10.1007%2fs11120-020-00770-7&partnerID=40&md5=280791ae8507c4e9eec01ad6d72e938e,"Department of Physics, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H4B 1R6, Canada; Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada","Modafferi, D., Department of Physics, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H4B 1R6, Canada, Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; Zazubovich, V., Department of Physics, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H4B 1R6, Canada; Kálmán, L., Department of Physics, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC  H4B 1R6, Canada",Bacterial reaction center; Conformational changes; Electrochromism; Electron transfer; Explosive detection; Photosynthesis,,"Zazubovich, V.; Department of Physics, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Canada; email: valter.zazubovits@concordia.ca

2-s2.0-85123980885,"Fingerprint has been well-known as “one most important forensic evidence” for a long time. Besides the ability to identify an individual with its patterns, fingerprint contains numerous key information about a suspect. Demonstrably, the secretion and deposition of chemical components in fingerprint can be used to analyze the characteristics of a suspect. The detection of substances in fingerprint has therewith aroused great interests of criminal investigators and forensic researchers since it facilitates narrowing the scope of criminal suspects. For example, in fighting against the violent crimes, the detection of ammunition and explosive residues in fingerprint can greatly help the investigation of the cases; the identification of drug residues and metabolites in fingerprint can provide information about whether the suspect uses drugs, smokes or is undergoing a disease treatment. The detection of food residues and cosmetic components in fingerprint can assist in inferring a suspect about his/her certain life habit. This paper reviews the researches on the detection of fingerprint from five aspects relating to drug users, smokers, explosive carriers, sexual assaulters and gender. The expounding mainly involves with the detection methods about biochemical choices (e.g., combining antibodies with fluorescent materials), biological assays (e.g., competitive enzyme immunoassay), instrumental analysis handlings (e.g., mass spectrometry, infrared spectrum analysis) and statistical ways. Based on the established researches and the problems confronted in the actual criminal investigation, three prospective development directions (of endogenous/exogenous substance and the age of fingerprint) are proposed for the forensic fingerprint intelligence analysis. Anyway, obtainment of more case information is always desirable for fingerprint identification so as to portray a suspect accurately further, and promote the role of forensic science in crime investigation and other legal processes as ably as possible. © 2020, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

2-s2.0-85075985395,"In this paper we interpret previous experimental measurements of impacts on single crystal PETN in the context of a simple continuum model. Hugoniot calculations using the simple model framework under various limiting assumptions envelope measured Hugoniot states reasonably well and suggest that non-negligible deviatoric elastic strains may exist in the shock compressed state for weak impacts. An accompanying simple kinematic model for lattice deformation was used to estimate the expected shifts in X-ray diffraction peaks for the (211) plane under impacts normal to (110) planes. The results suggest that negligible relaxation of the deviatoric lattice deformation occurs on the short (10–20 ns) time and wave propagation (40–80 m) scales of laser-driven shock experiments, and that the corresponding elastic strains may be large. Because of the potentially large deviatoric elastic strains, the specific finite deformation strain measure used within thermomechanical single crystal models is of significant consequence, which is explored numerically by the comparison of isothermal purely elastic responses under uniaxial and simple shear deformations. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85077943762,"Nanocalorimetry can generate rapid and arbitrary heating profiles for thermal and thermodynamic measurements with high sensitivity, especially for small samples, often at the nanogram mass scale. These features make nanocalorimetry a potentially useful tool for fundamental studies of the behavior of nanogram quantities of explosives during thermal desorption which is the front-end process for many analytical techniques used in screening of these materials in trace residues. Here, inkjet printing was used to reproducibly deposit nanogram quantities of explosives onto the active area of the nanocalorimeters and allowed for an estimation of sample mass based on gravimetric calibration, including cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and potassium chlorate (PC). Nanocalorimetry results on common explosives demonstrated the measurement capability. We observed both α-RDX and the metastable β-RDX phase using nanocalorimetry, along with the competitive vaporization and decomposition of RDX.

2-s2.0-85084005673,"Traditional primary explosives are usually heavy metal salts, especially salts of lead, such as lead azide (LA) and lead styphnate (LS), which can cause environmental pollution problems. The potassium salt of 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan (KDNBF) has attracted more and more attention due to its advantages of no heavy metal pollution to the environment and appropriate sensitivity. There are many reports on the thermal properties and applications of KDNBF, but few reports on the morphological properties. In addition, little is known about the optimal synthesis conditions of KDNBF with different morphologies in the preparation process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to determine the optimal experimental conditions for obtaining the maximum yields of KDNBF with different morphologies. The synthesized KDNBF was identified by means of SEM, NMR, FTIR, EA, and TG-DSC, and its sensitivity was measured using BAM fallhammer, BAM friction tester, and electrostatic spark sensitivity tester. The experimental results indicated that the maximum yields of flaky and spherical KDNBFs could reach 85.6 % and 82.6 % after purification under the optimal experimental condition, respectively. The spherical KDNBF powder had a relatively denser structure than the flaky KDNBF powder. The thermal analyses showed that the activation energies of the decomposition reaction of the flaky and spherical KDNBF powders calculated by the Kissinger method were 171.5 and 188.5 kJ mol−1, respectively, and the Ozawa method were 170.7 and 186.9 kJ mol−1, respectively. The thermal stability of spherical KDNBF powder was higher than that of flaky KDNBF powder. In addition, the sensitivity tests showed that the spherical KDNBF powder was less sensitive than the flaky KDNBF powder. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85079663498,"2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a molecule which is easily identified with current instrumental techniques but it is generally impossible to distinguish between sources of the same substance (TNT). To overcome this difficulty, we present a multi stable isotope approach using isotope ratio monitoring by mass spectrometry (irm-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometry (irm-NMR). In the one hand, irm-MS provides bulk isotopic composition at natural abundance in 13C and 15N. The range of variation between samples is rather small particularly for 13C. In the other hand, irm-13C NMR and irm-15N NMR enable the determination of positional intramolecular 13C/12C ratios (δ13Ci) and 15N/14N ratios (δ15Ni) with high precision that lead to larger variation between samples. The present work reports an application of the recent methodology using irm-15N NMR to determine position-specific 15N isotope content of TNT. The interest of this methodology is compared to irm-13C NMR and irm-MS (13C and 15N) in terms of TNT samples discrimination. Thanks to the use of irm-NMR the results show a unique isotopic fingerprint for each TNT which enable origin discrimination between the samples without ambiguity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Joubert V., Silvestre V., Ladroue V., Besacier F., Blondel P., Akoka S., Baguet E., Remaud G.S.",56176075000;22956700600;36606276800;6603164486;57215002912;7003994917;6602405251;6701505202;,Forensic application of position-specific isotopic analysis of trinitrotoluene (TNT) by NMR to determine 13C and 15N intramolecular isotopic profiles,2020,Talanta,213,,120819,,,NA,7,10.1016/j.talanta.2020.120819,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079663498&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2020.120819&partnerID=40&md5=04ab8028cf7e4eabfe637983531af83e,"Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France; Institut National de Police Scientifique, Laboratoire de Lyon, 31 avenue Franklin RooseveltEcully Cedex  69134, France","Joubert, V., Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France; Silvestre, V., Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France; Ladroue, V., Institut National de Police Scientifique, Laboratoire de Lyon, 31 avenue Franklin RooseveltEcully Cedex  69134, France; Besacier, F., Institut National de Police Scientifique, Laboratoire de Lyon, 31 avenue Franklin RooseveltEcully Cedex  69134, France; Blondel, P., Institut National de Police Scientifique, Laboratoire de Lyon, 31 avenue Franklin RooseveltEcully Cedex  69134, France; Akoka, S., Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France; Baguet, E., Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France; Remaud, G.S., Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CEISAM, University of Nantes, CNRS UMR6230, Nantes, F-44322, France","2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene; Explosives; Irm-13C NMR; Irm-15N NMR; PSIA","Explosives; Forensic science; Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; 13C NMR; 15N-NMR; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Forensic applications; Instrumental techniques; Isotopic analysis; Isotopic composition; PSIA; Nuclear magnetic resonance","Remaud, G.S.; Elucidation of Biosynthesis by Isotopic Spectrometry Group, CNRS UMR6230, France; email: gerald.remaud@univ-nantes.fr",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85089271416,"Fingerprint ridge patterns continue to be tremendously important in forensic science because of their power to identify individuals. However, the current emphasis on the patterns fails to take advantage of additional chemical information they contain that may have a bearing on an investigation. One way this information can be useful is through correlating the fingerprint pattern with the presence of compounds that suggest exposure to compounds of interest, such as energetic materials that can be used to create explosive devices. We report here how interrogation of fingermarks by MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to expose the presence of the explosive compounds trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl and picric acid, while yielding the fingerprint pattern that is traditionally collected in crime scene investigation. Ion images derived from diagnostic [M−H]− ions at nominal m/z 226 and 228 for TNT and picric acid respectively, and the [M-NO2-H]− ion at m/z 241 for tetryl were generated and revealed the fingerprint pattern. Direct analysis in real-time high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) analysis of fingerprints was found to be useful in enabling rapid detection of diagnostic ions, so that their presence could inform whether subsequent MALDI-MSI experiments should be performed. The approach illustrates how DART-HRMS and MALDI-MSI in tandem can be employed in touch chemistry biometrics for revealing a direct connection between an individual and materials of forensic interest to which they have been exposed, such as explosives. © 2020","Longo C.M., Musah R.A.",57195072282;6603027284;,MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging for touch chemistry biometric analysis: Establishment of exposure to nitroaromatic explosives through chemical imaging of latent fingermarks,2020,Forensic Chemistry,20,,100269,,,NA,8,10.1016/j.forc.2020.100269,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089271416&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2020.100269&partnerID=40&md5=6524c437f49df68584e6f074880d34dd,"Department of Chemistry, University at Albany, State University of New York, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY  12222, United States","Longo, C.M., Department of Chemistry, University at Albany, State University of New York, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY  12222, United States; Musah, R.A., Department of Chemistry, University at Albany, State University of New York, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY  12222, United States",Biometrics; Explosives; Fingerprints; MALDI-MS; MS-imaging,,"Musah, R.A.; Department of Chemistry, 1400 Washington Ave., United States; email: rmusah@albany.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

RDX, TNT and HMX in their pure form at a distance of ~6.5 m in standoff mode using femtosecond (fs) filament induced breakdown spectroscopy technique (fs FIBS) together with principal component analysis. A ~30 cm length fs filament obtained by a two-lens configuration was used to interrogate those energetic molecules in the form of pressed pellets (150 mg each). The plasma emissions were collected by a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) from a distance of ~8 m away from the investigation zone.

Furthermore, we have also summarised a few important results from our recent investigations of bulk energetic materials in various configurations (including those with fs filaments). The results obtained from various fs FIBS configurations corroborate that the filament generation and its properties, the size and f-number of collection optics influence signal strength in the FIBS technique.

2-s2.0-85096802271,"High explosives (HE) represent a high risk to the safety and health of the general population. Therefore, there is an ongoing demand for methods of analysis with limits of detection at trace levels for these hazardous chemicals. Since human hair is one of the main physical attributes of our bodies, the interaction of hair surfaces with HE can be of critical importance in forensic and security applications. Noninvasive in situ approaches such as spectroscopic methods are preferred for elucidating these interactions. Among the spectroscopy-based methodologies, those based on Raman scattering are often favored because the sharpness of the vibrational signals facilitates the precise location of the peak maxima and enables more precise determination of the band shifts due to intermolecular interactions. This preliminary study is based on the detection of the HEs 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) on human hair strands by RS. Raman spectral libraries obtained with a 660-nm laser excitation line were generated for black, bleached, and natural gray hair using direct deposition of PETN, TNT, and RDX. Results obtained were confirmed using portable systems operating at 785 and 1064 nm. Spectral data were preprocessed to correct a high fluorescence background exhibited by the samples due to the indole groups and melanin present in hair. Despite the high fluorescence levels that characterized all the samples, the vibrational signatures that identify the presence of the HEs studied could be detected once the optimum acquisition parameters were established. Among the three hair types studied, gray hair was the best substrate to observe the vibrations of HE crystals on hair. A method limit of detection of 2 ± 1 ng was estimated from image analysis of the HE crystals observed and confirmed as ∼ 3 ± 1 ng using spectroscopic analysis.  © 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Colón-González F.M., Perez-Almodovar L.A., Barreto-Pérez M., Vargas-Alers G.L., Santos-Rolón J.M., Hernández-Rivera S.P.",57220067120;57209249629;57220075805;57220069266;57220073382;57204205788;,Raman scattering detection of high explosives on human hair,2020,Optical Engineering,59,10,107103,,,NA,2,10.1117/1.OE.59.10.107103,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096802271&doi=10.1117%2f1.OE.59.10.107103&partnerID=40&md5=5231847359ebd4348e84fbbd6757d9ae,"University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico","Colón-González, F.M., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Perez-Almodovar, L.A., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Barreto-Pérez, M., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Vargas-Alers, G.L., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Santos-Rolón, J.M., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Hernández-Rivera, S.P., University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Chemical Imaging and Surface Analysis Center, Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats-II, Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence for Explosive Research, Department of Chemistry, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico",detection of high explosives on hair; forensic analysis; high explosives; human hair; melanin; Raman scattering,"Crystals; Explosives; Fluorescence; Health risks; Laser excitation; Network security; Raman scattering; Spectroscopic analysis; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Acquisition parameters; Intermolecular interactions; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate; Precise determinations; Security application; Spectroscopic method; Vibrational signature; Explosives detection","Colón-González, F.M.; University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguëz, Puerto Rico; email: francheska.colon@upr.edu

The structural features of the PRAs were characterized using a scanning electron microscope, a laser particle size analyzer and an optical microscope, and the experimental results showed that the PRAs were ellipsoidal microspheres with an average particle size of 200 μm and had double-layer core/shell hollow-structures. The inner hollow shell of the microsphere could serve as sensitizing bubble when it was undamaged whatever the status of outer shell, and once it was broken, the materials in the outer and inner shells would react with each other and generate new sensitizing bubbles in emulsion explosive. The brisance and underwater explosion experimental results showed that when the addition of PRAs was determined to be 2 mass %, the resistance to dynamic pressure of emulsion explosive sensitized by glass microsphere (GM) would be improved significantly without affecting its power. The lead column compression of GM-2 mass % PRAs sensitized emulsion explosive was 16.05 mm, which was close to that of GM sensitized emulsion explosive.

2-s2.0-85084167479,"Nitroaromatic explosives, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, are representative aromatic compounds, which are generally highly toxic. For their toxic mechanisms, little is known about their interaction with cell membranes, although this is essential for their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity profiling. Here, we investigated the membrane permeation and partitioning of 12 nitroaromatic explosives with typical functional groups (e.g., -NO2, -NH2, -OCH3and -OH) by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Based on free-energy curves, we obtained three key parameters that describe the behavior of permeation and partitioning, namely liposome-water partition coefficient (KLW), permeability coefficient (P) and translocation time (τ). Functional groups contribute little toKLW, indicating that the membrane absorption of nitroaromatic explosives is primarily controlled by the hydrophobic effect of the benzene ring.Pshows an obvious decline with increasing polar group number (Np), and thereforeτexhibits a continuous increase. In addition, the preferred location (zmin) of explosive molecules in membranes is closer to the head group of lipids when they have more polar groups. Further analysis shows that the hydrogen bond (H-bond) interaction of explosives with water and lipids plays a crucial role in the dependence of permeation and partitioning on polar groups. The molecules with largerNpcan form more H-bonds with water in the aqueous phase, which limits their motion into the deeper hydrophobic region of membranes.

It was assumed that the propane had been dispersed as a vapour/droplet cloud to form a stoichiometric mixture with atmospheric oxygen before detonation. This is the objective for fuel–air weapons and the worst-case scenario for accidental propane explosions such as boiling liquid expanding vapour explosions. The TNT equivalences of propane/oxygen and ANFO, which have energy yields less than TNT, show little variation when calculated using the different blast wave physical properties. In contrast, the equivalences for propane, which has a significantly higher energy yield than TNT, show a broad range of values, with those based on the impulses being significantly larger than those based on the peak values. The equivalence based on the positive-phase integrated work flux is intermediate between the peak and impulse values.

The residual acid content in solid TATP depends on the type of acid and on its concentration in the reaction mixture. Increasing the concentration of acid in the reaction mixture leads to a higher acid content in TATP crystals. Sublimation of TATP during storage also has a significant impact on the acid concentration in TATP crystals. Sublimation of TATP gradually increases the content of non-volatile acid in TATP crystals (sulfuric and solid organic acids) while the content of volatile acids (hydrochloric, nitric) does not significantly change during TATP sublimation. The increasing sulfuric acid content in TATP crystals during sublimation decreases thermal stability of TATP and the start of TATP decomposition was observed even at 45 °C. The concentration of volatile hydrochloric and nitric acids does not change significantly in TATP crystals during sublimation and, therefore, the sublimation process does not have an impact on TATP's thermal stability in these cases. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85084503284,"Erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) is a homemade explosive with high explosive performance which can easily be synthesized using widely available chemical precursors. Ascertaining the manner in which ETN is synthesized and being able to trace the ETN back to its precursor materials may aid in the forensic identification. As a proof of concept, seven different types of ETN were synthesized with laboratory grade materials as well as commercially available chemicals from the hardware store and grocery store. The seven different types of solid ETN and the reaction quenches were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to probe the different classes of ETN and reaction quenches. Several PLS-DA models were produced with the seven different types of ETN and quenches having their own classification, ETN and quenches based on their acid source, and ETN and the quenches based on their nitrate source. Regardless of which classification manner was used, there were no differences found between the different types of ETN or their reaction quenches. Moreover, it is demonstrated that there is inherent variability in the synthesis of ETN making HPLC an unreliable method to determine the source of the synthesis materials. Elemental impurities were measured in seven solid ETN samples and their reaction quenches by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). No differences were found between the solid ETN samples, but there were trace metals found in the reaction quenches which were found to be identifiers of the source material. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Freye C.E., Kinman W.S., Tiemann C., McDonald D., Manner V.W., Bowden P.R., Tappan B.C., Greenfield M.T.",56736683800;8914444900;57216754035;57216743132;6504272307;40261059000;6506232355;26432594400;,Linking chemical precursors to the synthesis of erythritol tetranitrate,2020,Forensic Chemistry,19,,100246,,,NA,3,10.1016/j.forc.2020.100246,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084503284&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2020.100246&partnerID=40&md5=077d11f2d9a3f2878362a8068469eb1e,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Los Alamos National Laboratory, C-NR, Nuclear & Radiochemistry, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Freye, C.E., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Kinman, W.S., Los Alamos National Laboratory, C-NR, Nuclear & Radiochemistry, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Tiemann, C., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; McDonald, D., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Manner, V.W., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Bowden, P.R., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Tappan, B.C., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Greenfield, M.T., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Erythritol tetranitrate; ETN; Homemade Explosives; HPLC; PLS-DA,,"Freye, C.E.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States; email: cfreye@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85081975523,"4-Amino-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate (4-ATN) is an energetic and non-sensitive ionic liquid, which was introduced as a good candidate in previous works for the replacement of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in melt-cast explosives. Since previous studies used pure nitric acid for nitration of 4-ATN, the effect of the use of low price industrial nitric acids (50 %, 70 % and 98 %) is investigated on the percent yields of 4-ATN. The thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) are done on the synthesized 4-ATN with impure nitric acid at a heating rate of 10 K·min–1 by the vacuum system. The obtained TGA/DSC curves confirm decomposition of 4-ATN involving melting and dissociation. Derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of 4-ATN at various heating rates are applied to obtain activation energy of thermolysis by several model-free techniques. The calculated activation energies are in the range 78.7–87.7 kJ·mol–1, which are about 10 kJ·mol–1 more than the reported activation energy of industrial TNT (purity 98.2 %), i.e. 66–70 kJ·mol–1. Assessments of detonation performance of 4-ATN are also compared with TNT, which show higher detonation performance of 4-ATN. Thus, 4-ATN can be used with nitramine compounds as melt-cast explosives with higher thermal stability and detonation performance than corresponding nitramine compound/TNT explosives. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85088840464,"A new type of emulsion explosive sensitized by hydrogen-storage has been invented previously. To better understand the role of hydrogen in emulsion explosives, the detonation experiments with different gas storage were conducted. Several gases, such as helium, oxygen, and nitrogen, were taken into account. Brisance tests, detonation velocity tests, and underwater detonation experiments showed that the high-pressure hydrogen can improve the power and energy of emulsion explosive. The adiabatic compression of different gases was calculated. The pressure and temperature of the gas in GMs were obtained. Hydrogen has better compression performance than the other gases. Combining experiments and theoretical calculations can obtain that, hydrogen plays an important role in hot spots formation rate and emulsion explosive energy, and nitrogen and oxygen have little contribution to the energy of emulsion explosive, while helium is difficult to store in GMs and has a negative influence on the performance of emulsion explosive. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Specifically, it aims to build an array of sensors aided with Raspberry Pi and Python programming language to implement the necessary algorithms, together with the documentation of gathered information to conclude the effectiveness of the system. ANN is used for pattern recognition and classification, while PCA is for feature reduction and extraction. Sensors are selected by PCA through dimension reduction of signals obtained, which resulted to sensors MQ8, MQ136, MQ7 having the highest retained information of 83.07%, 8.79% and 7.27%. The classifier was trained by feeding acetone with varying concentrations from 5% to 100% with their corresponding expected classifications that resulted to 0.02% of training error. Using a Confusion matrix, accuracy was determined which assesses the classification between the E-nose and expected classification of commercial products.

However, there is minimal dynamic dispersal research at high speed. Therefore, the numerical calculation methods of explosive dispersion have become a priority. A model is proposed that can predict the characteristics of the explosive dispersal for fuel both in the near-field and the far-field. Then, the basic laws of the fuel cloud formed during explosive dispersal are derived. The model is constructed by six parts of different processes, with the characteristics obtained by tracking the fuel droplets or particles and calculating their velocity, displacement, mass, and particle size.

2-s2.0-85082765092,"4,6-Dinitrobenzofuroxan (4,6-DNBF) is explosive and can also be used as an important intermediate in the synthesis of other explosives. It can be prepared by nitrating benzofuroxan (BF) with mixed nitric/sulfuric acid. However, little is known about its optimal synthesis parameters in the preparation process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to improve the yield of 4,6-DNBF. A L9 (34) orthogonal array with four control factors and three levels of each control factor was used to design nine experimental conditions. The experimental data were transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio to analyze and evaluate the experimental conditions of the optimal parameter combination for the maximum yield of 4,6-DNBF. The verification results indicated that the optimal synthesis parameters were as follows: nitration temperature was 40 °C, mass ratio of BF to H2SO4, was 1 : 15, volume ratio of HNO3 to H2SO4 was 1 : 2.0 and reaction time was 4 hours, and then the maximum crude yield and the maximum yield after purification could reach 73.2 % and 49.0 %, respectively. Furthermore, the synthesized 4,6-DNBF was identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), elemental analyzer (EA), ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-Vis) and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and its sensitivity was determined using BAM fallhammer, BAM friction tester, and electrostatic spark sensitivity tester. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85079500095,"Polymer bounded explosives (PBXs) consist of energetic crystals coated with a polymer binder. These materials exhibit a highly heterogeneous microstructure. The initiation of the detonation phenomenon in PBXs is believed to be generated at the microstructure scale through hotspots. Hence, many of the explosives properties (initiation, desensitization, etc.) are understood as a direct consequence of their microstructure. Mesoscale modeling directly addresses the physics of hotspot formation. Unfortunately, high computational cost prevents their use on laboratory-sized and large scale experiments. In practice, continuum-scale models remain mandatory. We describe a new reactive burn model, named WGT, aiming to represent, at the continuum scale, some of the complexity of the PBX's microstructure. The initiation regime is driven by the shock temperature and results from surrogate modeling of the kinetics of a heterogeneous nucleation and growth model. The other regimes follow the formulation of the WHS2D2 reactive burn model and are driven by the local temperature. This model was calibrated on experimental results for PBX 9502 available in the literature, such as detonation velocity-curvature laws, Pop-plot data, or embedded electromagnetic particle velocity gauges. The model was also tested against desensitization and propagation data. © 2020 Author(s).","Reynaud M., Sorin R., Dubois V., Desbiens N.",57214912707;56180654500;57197581617;8542815100;,WGT: A mesoscale-informed reactive burn model,2020,Journal of Applied Physics,127,6,65901,,,NA,4,10.1063/1.5135362,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079500095&doi=10.1063%2f1.5135362&partnerID=40&md5=34fedfaff72b6d72c86ddbeb8c40ced6,"CEA, DAM, DIF, Arpajon, F-91297, France","Reynaud, M., CEA, DAM, DIF, Arpajon, F-91297, France; Sorin, R., CEA, DAM, DIF, Arpajon, F-91297, France; Dubois, V., CEA, DAM, DIF, Arpajon, F-91297, France; Desbiens, N., CEA, DAM, DIF, Arpajon, F-91297, France",,Detonation; Growth kinetics; Microstructure; Nucleation; Velocity control; Computational costs; Detonation velocity; Electromagnetic particle velocity gauges; Heterogeneous microstructure; Heterogeneous nucleation and growth; Large scale experiments; Meso-scale modeling; Reactive burn model; Initiators (explosives),"Reynaud, M.; CEA, France; email: maxime.reynaud@cea.fr",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85079765582,"The detonation of high explosive (HE) material generates a cloud containing a high concentration of detonation products in the form of aerosol particles and gases. Modeling and simulation of aerosol metrics in an explosive cloud is a complex problem as it involves various processes such as chemical reaction, nucleation, volume expansion, and coagulation. Several models have been developed to study the atmospheric dispersion of these detonation products, but very few or no model is available to study the evolution of aerosol metrics at the early stage. In this work, we present a numerical model to simulate the temporal evolution of aerosol metrics in an expanding cloud by coupling transient thermodynamic properties with important microphysical processes. To illustrate the application, the numerical model is applied to a typical HE, and the aerosol particle properties such as size distribution, number concentration, and average size are estimated from the numerical results.

Although up to 716 mg/L parent MeNQ caused no significant mortality or effects on growth in larval P. promelas fish in 7-d exposures, a similar concentration of MeNQ subjected to UV treatment resulted in 85% mortality. The UV treatment degraded only 3.3% of the MeNQ (5800 mg/L stock, UV-treated for 6 h), indicating that MeNQ degradation products have potentially high toxicity. The parent MeNQ exposure caused significantly decreased transcriptional expression of genes within the significantly enriched insulin metabolic pathway, suggesting antagonism of bioenergetics pathways, which complements observed, although nonsignificant, decreases in body weight. Significant differential transcriptional expression in the UV-degraded MeNQ treatments resulted in significant enrichment of pathways and functions related to the cell cycle, as well as erythrocyte function involved in O2/CO2 exchange. These functions represent potential mechanistic sources of increased toxicity observed in the UV-degraded MeNQ exposures, which are distinct from previously observed mechanisms underlying increased toxicity of UV-degraded NQ in fish.

2-s2.0-85076837249,"Exhumed, badly decomposed human remains constitute very difficult research material. It requires a great deal of caution and critical judgment to analyze the nature of injuries, especially those resulting from an explosion. Scientific publications in the field of traumatology concerning injuries caused by the action of explosives mainly focus on the effects of contemporary terrorist or military activities. The results of this research regard mainly clinical medicine and the organization of healthcare. This article discusses the problems and solutions of determining the presence of injuries caused by explosions on badly decomposed human remains exhumed 70 years after death. To obtain optimal results in valuable injures estimation it is vital to apply efficient work methods i.e.: forensic team composed of experienced pathologist and anthropologist, archeological methodology and doubled examination and description of the remains (in the field and next in the autopsy room), detailed photographical documentation and protocol. The results of forensic examinations of the remains (58 fragments forming anatomical wholes), derived from not fewer than 30 individuals (MNI = 30), confirmed, despite the presence of severe taphonomic changes, the presence of injuries caused by an explosion. Forensic examination of the remains revealed a characteristic pattern of injuries resulting from the dismembering the bodies. We discovered typical traumatic amputation of the limbs, which corresponds to the aforementioned mechanism of injury. The findings confirm the thesis that in the area of the former Luftwaffe airport near Stary Grodków (Opole province, Poland), in September 1946, a group of Polish postwar partisans was liquidated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Szleszkowski Ł., Thannhäuser A., Szwagrzyk K., Kuliczkowski M., Jurek T.",8542884400;55317005400;55640387900;57193636786;25632330900;,Blast injuries found on the exhumed remains of Polish postwar partisans killed by the Polish security service in 1946,2020,Legal Medicine,42,,101659,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.legalmed.2019.101659,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076837249&doi=10.1016%2fj.legalmed.2019.101659&partnerID=40&md5=078f59267c3972003b12b0664ae0d8db,"Department of Forensic Medicine, Wrocław Medical University, Mikulicza-Radeckiego 4, Wrocław, PL-50-345, Poland; Institute of National Remembrance, Office of Search and Identification, Wołoska 7, Warsaw, PL-02-675, Poland; Provincial Police Headquarters in Wrocław, Forensic Laboratory, Podwale 31-33, Wrocław, PL-50-040, Poland","Szleszkowski, Ł., Department of Forensic Medicine, Wrocław Medical University, Mikulicza-Radeckiego 4, Wrocław, PL-50-345, Poland; Thannhäuser, A., Department of Forensic Medicine, Wrocław Medical University, Mikulicza-Radeckiego 4, Wrocław, PL-50-345, Poland; Szwagrzyk, K., Institute of National Remembrance, Office of Search and Identification, Wołoska 7, Warsaw, PL-02-675, Poland; Kuliczkowski, M., Provincial Police Headquarters in Wrocław, Forensic Laboratory, Podwale 31-33, Wrocław, PL-50-040, Poland; Jurek, T., Department of Forensic Medicine, Wrocław Medical University, Mikulicza-Radeckiego 4, Wrocław, PL-50-345, Poland",Blast injury; Crime scene; Excavation; Exhumation; Explosion; Gunshot injuries; Polish anticommunist resistance; Traumatic amputation,anatomy; anthropology; archeology; army; Article; autolysis; autopsy; blast injury; body remains; exhumation; explosion; forensic pathology; human; human tissue; limb; medical documentation; medical photography; pathologist; Poland; taphonomy; traumatic amputation; war; blast injury; forensic medicine; male; pathology; time factor; Armed Conflicts; Blast Injuries; Explosions; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Poland; Time Factors,"Szleszkowski; Department of Forensic Medicine, Mikulicza-Radeckiego 4, Poland; email: lukasz.szleszkowski@umed.wroc.pl",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85073025056,"The feasibility of measuring the aging and degradation of PBX 9501 via online two dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) is investigated, and a preliminary instrumental setup and method is developed. Plastic-Bonded eXplosive (PBX) 9501 is nominally composed of 94.9 wt% HMX, 2.5 wt% Estane® 5703 (poly (ester urethane)), 2.5 wt% BDNPA/F (nitroplasticizer), 0.1 wt% Irganox 1010 and PBNA (N-phenyl-naphthylamine) at low concentrations. When exposed to various environmental conditions, PBX 9501 will degrade through different pathways. Because PBX 9501 is composed of both low molecular weight compounds (BDNPA/F, Irganox 1010, PBNA, and potential degradation products) and high molecular weight compounds (Estane® 5703), analysis is normally performed via two independent analyses. The low molecular weight species are analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the high molecular weight species via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). While these individual techniques yield information about the aging of PBX 9501, the combination of HPLC and SEC (i.e. HPLC × SEC) can simplify and streamline the analyses while also providing additional chemical information. A simplified sample preparation method is proposed for LC × LC analysis. Various SEC columns and HPLC column selection, flow rate, and gradient ramps were investigated for their application of measuring aged PBX 9501. Finally, two LC × LC separations of a library standard of PBX 9501 and a sample of aged PBX 9501 are compared. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Freye C.E., Rosales C.J., Thompson D.G., Brown G.W., Larson S.A.",56736683800;57211216956;7404934731;55493404600;7202795313;,Development of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography for investigating aging of plastic bonded explosives,2020,Journal of Chromatography A,1611,,460580,,,NA,8,10.1016/j.chroma.2019.460580,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073025056&doi=10.1016%2fj.chroma.2019.460580&partnerID=40&md5=dcf018558f185ac8f7b3945ab9d317de,"Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Los Alamos National Laboratory, W-9, Weapon Systems Surveillance, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States","Freye, C.E., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Rosales, C.J., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Thompson, D.G., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Brown, G.W., Los Alamos National Laboratory, M-7, High Explosives Science and Technology, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States; Larson, S.A., Los Alamos National Laboratory, W-9, Weapon Systems Surveillance, Los Alamos, NM  87545, United States",Comprehensive two-dimensional; Explosives; Liquid chromatography; PBX 9501,"Degradation; Esters; Explosives; Flow rate; High pressure liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Molecular weight; Comprehensive two-dimensional; Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography; High molecular weight compounds; Low molecular weight compounds; Low-molecular-weight species; PBX 9501; Sample preparation methods; Two-dimensional liquid chromatography; Size exclusion chromatography; explosive; plastic bonded explosive; unclassified drug; explosive; plastic; urethan; Article; degradation; feasibility study; flow rate; liquid chromatography; online system; priority journal; two dimensional liquid chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; procedures; size exclusion chromatography; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Explosive Agents; Plastics; Urethane","Freye, C.E.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States; email: cfreye@lanl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85085394917,"Objective: Detection of explosives is a challenge due to the use of improvised and concealed bombs. Post-bomb strike bodies are handled by emergency and forensic teams. We aimed to determine whether medical dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) algorithm and prediction model can readily detect and distinguish a range of explosives on the human body during disaster victim identification (DVI) processes of bombings. Materials and Methods: A medical DECT of 8 explosives (Semtex, Pastex, Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, Acetone peroxide, Nitrocellulose, Pentrite, Ammonium Nitrate, and classified explosive) was conducted ex-vivo and on an anthropomorphic phantom. Hounsfield unit (HU), electron density (ED), effective atomic number (Zeff), and dual energy index (DEI),were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Intra-class (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were computed. Explosives classification was performed through a prediction model with test-retest samples. Results: Except for DEI (p = 0.036), means of HU, ED, and Zeff were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between explosives ex-vivo and on the phantom (r > 0.80). Intra- and inter-reader ICC were good to excellent: 0.806 to 0.997 and 0.890, respectively. Except for the phantom DEI, all measurements from each individual explosive differed significantly. HU, ED, Zeff, and DEI differed depending on the type of explosive. Our decision tree provided Zeff and ED for explosives classification with high accuracy (83.7%) and excellent reliability (100%). Conclusion: Our medical DECT algorithm and prediction model can readily detect and distinguish our range of explosives on the human body.

In this work, an attempt has been made to present useful structural data in order to investigate and predict the explosive properties of these complexes. In this regard, interaction energy (IE), natural bond orbital (NBO), atoms in a molecule (AIM) as well as the three-dimensional Hirshfeld surface analysis and the two-dimensional fingerprint plots, charge transfers, HUMO-LUMO gap, oxygen balance (%OB) amounts, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps were utilized to assign intermolecular interactions, bond lengths, the nature of metal-ligand bonds, and energies in subject compounds. The results reveal that among the five applied levels of theory, interaction energies obtaining from M06-2X/Def2TZVP were in excellent compliance with the experiments. Additionally, the N⋯O interaction, oxygen balance, density, and HOMO–LUMO gap were the most contributing factors in assigning sensitivity and detonation properties.

2-s2.0-85092352952,"In a homeland security setting, the ability to detect explosives at a distance is a top security priority. Consequently, the development of remote, noncontact detection systems continues to represent a path forward. In this vein, a remote detection system for excitation of infrared emissions using a CO2 laser for generating laser-induced thermal emission (LITE) is a possible solution. However, a LITE system using a CO2 laser has certain limitations, such as the requirement of careful alignment, interference by the CO2 signal during detection, and the power density loss due to the increase of the laser image at the sample plane with the detection distance. A remote chopped-laser induction system for LITE detection using a CO2 laser source coupled to a focusing telescope was built to solve some of these limitations. Samples of fixed surface concentration (500 μg / cm2) of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were used for the remote detection experiments at distances ranging between 4 and 8 m. This system was capable of thermally exciting and capturing the thermal emissions (TEs) at different times in a cyclic manner by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer coupled to a gold-coated reflection optics telescope (FTIR-GT).

As the wheel moved, it blocked the CO2 laser and allowed the spectroscopic system to capture the TEs of RDX.

2-s2.0-85087613702,"Billions of suitcases and other belongings are checked every year in the X-ray systems in airports around the world. This process is of great importance because it involves the detection of possible dangerous objects such as weapons and explosives. However, the work done by airport surveillance personnel is not free from errors, usually due to tiredness or distractions. This is a security problem that can always be reduced with the help of automatic intelligent tools. This paper attempts to make a contribution to the field of object recognition in X-ray testing for luggage control by proposing a deep learning system that combines a deep convolutional network with an adversarial autoencoder acting as a powerful feature extractor mechanism. The system is developed to separate transmission X-ray images into potentially overlapping regions, separating the X-ray image into organic and inorganic images, taking into consideration the overlapping between the same and different types of materials. To show the superiority of our proposed system, a comparative analysis was carried out including the state-of-the-art deep learning semantic segmentation systems. The proposed method demonstrated highly promising results, achieving the best performance in global accuracy, mean boundary F1 and mean IoU, with a percentage of 80.17%, 76.28% and 76.84%, respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chouai M., Merah M., Mimi M.",57211487231;53981711100;25031798500;,CH-Net: Deep adversarial autoencoders for semantic segmentation in X-ray images of cabin baggage screening at airports,2020,Journal of Transportation Security,13,01-Feb,,71,89,NA,8,10.1007/s12198-020-00211-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087613702&doi=10.1007%2fs12198-020-00211-5&partnerID=40&md5=6ec7fde128539f0210be691d48265d37,"Signals and systems laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mostaganem University, Site 1 Route Belahcel, Mostaganem, 27000, Algeria","Chouai, M., Signals and systems laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mostaganem University, Site 1 Route Belahcel, Mostaganem, 27000, Algeria; Merah, M., Signals and systems laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mostaganem University, Site 1 Route Belahcel, Mostaganem, 27000, Algeria; Mimi, M., Signals and systems laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mostaganem University, Site 1 Route Belahcel, Mostaganem, 27000, Algeria",Autoencoder; Baggage control; Deep learning; Semantic segmentation; Transport security,,"Chouai, M.; Signals and systems laboratory, Site 1 Route Belahcel, Algeria; email: mohamed.chouai@univ-mosta.dz",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

FESEM images indicated the successful synthesis of exfoliated graphene sheets with a thickness of 7 nm, 30 nm Fe nanoparticles, and pyramid Ag nanostructures, where the sides measured from 100 nm to 600 nm. UV–vis analysis detected plasmon bands at 700 nm and 914 nm for PAFG. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of elemental Ag and C. Two PAFG phases were obtained after centrifugation, which were designated as PAFG1 and PAFG2. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analyses showed that the rhodamine 6G (R6G) peaks with PAFG1 were 1.75 times larger than those with trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1.7 times larger than those with pyrene. SERS analysis of TNT with PAFG2 obtained 1.49 and 1.3 times greater peaks compared with those using pyrene and R6G, respectively. On average, the performance was around 1.4 times better with PAFG2 for each of the analytes. Measurements of the SERS spectra for TNT and pyrene with annealed PAFG (at mM and μM concentrations) showed that the enhancement factors (EFs) were 2.2 and 1.7 for the μM TNT and pyrene samples, respectively.

2-s2.0-85088087349,"Understanding the shaped-charge jet-initiation mechanism of covered explosives and the effect of explosive temperature is important for ammunition safety. We devised a method of using a shaped-charge jet-penetrating cover to shock-initiate heated explosives. This method achieves uniform temperature control of explosives via heating the upper and lower ends and preserves heat on the side of the explosive charge. We experimentally tested the method on hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)-based aluminized explosives (61 wt.% RDX, 30 wt.% Al, 9 wt.% binder) at different temperatures and cover thicknesses. The jet-penetration behavior and explosive detonation-wave growth were observed via X-ray photography, and the effect of explosive temperature on jet initiation was analyzed. A numerical model of the shaped-charge jet-initiating explosive was set up by considering the temperature change of the explosive and analyzing the detonation-wave growth and initiation thresholds of different explosive temperatures under jet shock initiation. Under a thin cover, the explosive showed prompt impact initiation by the jet; the initiation occurred very near to the explosive surface. However, for a thick cover, the explosion was initiated by a bow wave formed at a certain distance from the upper surface of the explosive, and a retonation wave was observed. The temperature of RDX-based aluminized explosives affects the two jet-initiation mechanisms. The shock sensitivity of the explosives to the jet decreased with increasing temperature, but the shock sensitivity increased when the temperature exceeded a certain value. A simulation method was established that can be used to predict shaped-charge jet initiation at different explosive temperatures. We obtained the relationship between the cover thickness and run-to-detonation distance under jet shock initiation, which provides a theoretical basis for safety analysis and evaluation of a warhead charge that is attacked by a shaped-charge jet. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For 3D nanoporous TATB architecture, the initiation threshold decreases and then increases with specific surface areas increased from 9.6 m2/g to 36.2 m2/g.

High porosity provides more collapse sites to generate high temperature for formation of hot spots. The low thermal conductivity and decomposition temperature could enhance the formation and ignition of the hot spots, and initial decomposition reaction of TATB. The effect of the decomposition temperature is higher than that of the thermal conductivity on the shock initiation properties.

2-s2.0-85087180780,"The relationship between detonation velocity and the elemental composition of components of aluminized explosives are assessed through quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR). Here, two new reliable, simple models are proposed for estimating aluminized explosives detonation heat and velocity based on molecular structure by applying QSPR. In this methodology it is assumed that these two detonation parameters can be presented as a function of elemental composition, density and several structural parameters. This new correlation of heat detonation has determination coefficient of 0.930, root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 324.4 and average absolute deviation (AAD) of 446kJ·kg–1 for 36 aluminized explosives with different molecular structures as the training set. The predictive power of this new correlation is checked through a cross validation method. Statistical parameters reveal relatively good result for this correlation. Also, the determination coefficient of detonation velocity for the other new model is 0.960 and it has 151.1 (RMSD) and 107.9 m·s–1 (AAD) for 42 aluminized explosives with different molecular structures as training set.

The PI microsphere possessed self-organized hierarchical nanostructure, large specific surface area (170 m2/g) and good thermostability (up to 400 °C). The BAμE device was prepared by adhering the PI microspheres on a quartz bar with Kapton double sided tape. Trace nitroaromatic explosives in environmental waters were extracted by the BAμE device, desorbed by thermal desorption (TD), and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The reproducibility of five BAμE devices prepared in parallel was less than 13.0% (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD). The BAμE device could stand up to 30 extraction/desorption cycles without decrease of extraction efficiency. The results of method validation showed that the BAμE-TD/GC–MS method possessed wide linearity (0.05–50 μg/L or 0.05–20 μg/L), high correlation coefficients (> 0.9987), good precision (RSDs < 11.8%), low detection limits (0.005–0.013 μg/L) and high enrichment factors (528–1410).

As the sensors offer limited accuracy, we further propose a server-based decision-making framework that utilizes a two-level feedback loop between the sensors and the server and explores spatial and temporal locality of the collected data to overcome the inherent low-accuracy of individual sensors.

2-s2.0-85043468887,"There is an on-going need for faster, more accurate, and easier to implement threat identification systems for concealed electronics, to thwart terrorism and espionage attempts. Common electronics are used in the design of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), targeting military, and civilian populations, while concealed recording devices steal proprietary/confidential data, compromising both government and industrial resources. This paper discusses a novel, nonintrusive, repeatable, reliable, expandable, and simple-to-implement detection and identification (DI) system for identifying threats by using unintended radiated emissions (URE). This paper differs from current URE proposals, by avoiding energy radiation. The proposed process also addresses big data problems involved in capturing and building databases of URE characteristics. Issue interpretation is utilized with URE data to distinguish between threat/nonthreat devices using multiple criteria decision analysis and other decision-making techniques to determine model and mode of hidden devices. System optimization, verified by testing, is used to improve the speed and accuracy of the identification algorithm. The system is developed with data from 130 devices and validated with 33 separate devices, which are representative of IED and espionage threats. Due to slow progress in the URE DI field, the properties and potential of a more effective DI system, compared to current methods, will be of interest to the explosive ordnance disposal, security services, electronic systems manufacturing, automated inventory, mobile application development communities, and potentially others as well. For a field that is not well documented, this paper provides a clear, concise, and detailed model for future research and applications of URE DI. © 2013 IEEE.","Friedel J.E., Holzer T.H., Sarkani S.",7006356142;55224121400;56279074200;,"Development, Optimization, and Validation of Unintended Radiated Emissions Processing System for Threat Identification",2020,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",50,6,8310938,2208,2219,NA,5,10.1109/TSMC.2018.2810305,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043468887&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2018.2810305&partnerID=40&md5=59d252f5732a2bf30f92dc8134b2403b,"Department of the Navy, NAVSEA, NSWC-IH, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States; Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, George Washington University, Washington, DC  20052, United States","Friedel, J.E., Department of the Navy, NAVSEA, NSWC-IH, Indian Head, MD  20640, United States; Holzer, T.H., Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, George Washington University, Washington, DC  20052, United States; Sarkani, S., Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, George Washington University, Washington, DC  20052, United States",Analysis and modeling; decision making; force field analysis (FFA); multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA); optimization; simple additive weighting (SAW); system development; unintended electromagnetic emissions (UEE); unintended radiated emissions (URE); validation,Antennas; Decision theory; Electric potential; Explosives; Flood control; Mobile computing; Models; Operations research; Optimization; Population statistics; Analysis and modeling; Antenna measurement; Electromagnetic emissions; Force field analysis; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Radiated emissions; Radio frequencies; Security; Simple additive weighting; System development; validation; Decision making,"Friedel, J.E.; Department of the Navy, United States; email: joseph.friedel@navy.mil",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The gun is the most preferable and easily available weapon for committing the crime. That is why the detection of gunshot residue is the most important scenario while investigating criminal activity. In present time, the use of explosives like RDX, TNT, DNT, etc. are increasing in terrorist activity, and therefore, it is necessary to find a way for the detection of these explosive compounds.

2-s2.0-85074730280,"When considering incident investigations and security checks focused on energetic materials, there is an ongoing need for rapid, on-scene chemical identification. Currently applied methods are not capable of meeting all requirements, and hence, portable mass spectrometry is an interesting alternative although many instrumental challenges still exist. To be able to analyze explosives with mass spectrometry outside the traditional laboratory, suitable ambient ionization methods need to be developed. Ideally such methods are also easily implemented in the field requiring limited to no power sources, gas supplies, flow controllers, and heating devices. For this reason, the potential of SAWN (surface acoustic wave nebulization) for the ambient ionization and subsequent mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of organic explosives was investigated in this study. Excellent sensitivity was observed for nitrate-based organic explosives when operating the MS in negative mode. No dominant adduct peaks were observed for the peroxides TATP and HMTD with SAWN-MS in positive mode. The MS spectra indicate extensive fragmentation of the peroxide explosives even under the mild ionization conditions provided by SAWN. The potential of SAWN-MS was demonstrated with the correct identification of nitrate-based organic explosives in pre- and post-explosion case samples in only a fraction of the time and effort required for the regular laboratory analysis. Results show that SAWN-MS can convincingly identify intact organic energetic compounds and mixtures but that sensitivity is not always sufficient to detect traces of explosives in post-explosion residues.

2-s2.0-85077812219,"We report on a standoff spectroscopic technique for detecting chemical residues on surfaces. An infrared (IR) camera was used in combination with a wavelength tunable mid-IR quantum cascade laser to acquire multispectral image arrays of a surface with explosive residue. IR spectral signatures of residue of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (commonly known as RDX) were extracted in the wavelength range 7.9 to 9.7 \mu \text{m} from the multispectral IR images. Detection of RDX was achieved for a lower surface concentration of 5~\mu \text{g} cm-2 and a higher surface concentration of 20~\mu \text{g} cm-2 at distances of 0.15 m and 1.5 m, respectively. We performed no background subtraction and the resulting IR spectra of RDX were compared with reference Fourier Transform IR Spectroscopy data that were acquired by placing 20 \mu \text{g} of RDX on a ZnS window. We found that the detection of RDX can be made with negligible interfering contribution of reflected IR photons from the substrate surface. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Datskos P.G., Morales-Rodriguez M.E., Senesac L.R.",7005594070;37009285000;6602393815;,Standoff Imaging of Trace RDX Using Quantum Cascade Lasers,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,20,1,8832266,149,154,NA,4,10.1109/JSEN.2019.2940883,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077812219&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2019.2940883&partnerID=40&md5=0f127de9b1c8469b1f2661b7df9e2e43,"National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO  80401, United States; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN  37931, United States","Datskos, P.G., National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO  80401, United States; Morales-Rodriguez, M.E., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN  37931, United States; Senesac, L.R., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN  37931, United States",infrared spectroscopy; quantum cascade lasers; Sensing,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Infrared imaging; Infrared spectroscopy; Zinc sulfide; Background subtraction; Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine; Fourier transform IR spectroscopy; Multispectral images; Sensing; Spectroscopic technique; Surface concentration; Wavelength tunable; Quantum cascade lasers,"Datskos, P.G.; National Renewable Energy LaboratoryUnited States; email: panos.datskos@nrel.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85062727804,"In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) is increasingly being used to remediate a variety of organic contaminants in soil and groundwater. Explosives, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4-dintroanisole (DNAN), and 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), are not easily oxidized due to the presence of nitro groups in their structures. However, these nitro groups can be reduced to amino groups by soil microorganisms, making them more prone to oxidation. In this study, we propose bioreduction as a pretreatment to ISCO. The oxidation of DNAN, DNT, NTO, and their respective reduced transformation products, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline (MENA), 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (NAT), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (ATO), by potassium permanganate showed that lower permanganate concentrations and shorter time-scales are needed to oxidize the compounds once they are reduced. Significant fractions of the daughter products were mineralized to CO2 (30% and 22% for MENA and NAT, respectively, using 2.5 mM permanganate, and 48% for ATO using 1.0 mM permanganate). The bioreductive pretreatment was demonstrated by incubating 1.0 mM NTO anaerobically using soil as inoculum and pyruvate as electron donor. Once NTO was completely reduced to ATO, 1.0 mM permanganate was added, immediately oxidizing 86% of the compound. In controls without pretreatment, no oxidation was observed. NTO and ATO oxidation was tested in soils that differed in organic matter content. The results indicate that natural organic matter decreases the efficiency of NTO oxidation. However, ATO oxidation was not affected by the presence of soil. Our results suggest that the proposed reductive pretreatment followed by ISCO presents a safe and cost-effective alternative for explosives remediation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Madeira C.L., Kadoya W.M., Li G., Wong S., Sierra-Alvarez R., Field J.A.",57191616804;57197856869;55864851600;57200031932;7003645029;7403246051;,Reductive biotransformation as a pretreatment to enhance in situ chemical oxidation of nitroaromatic and nitroheterocyclic explosives,2019,Chemosphere,222,,,1025,1032,NA,8,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.178,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062727804&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2019.01.178&partnerID=40&md5=8d5a5d49c8ef9166c3f7ad179d5f9d34,"Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States","Madeira, C.L., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States; Kadoya, W.M., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States; Li, G., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States; Wong, S., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States; Sierra-Alvarez, R., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States; Field, J.A., Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ  85721, United States",Biotransformation; Explosive; Insensitive munitions compound; ISCO; Permanganate,"Aromatic compounds; Biogeochemistry; Cost effectiveness; Explosives; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Potash; Remediation; Soils; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; 3 Nitro 1 ,2 ,4 triazol 5 ones (NTO); Biotransformation; In-situ chemical oxidations; Insensitive munitions; ISCO; Permanganate; Situ chemical oxidation (ISCO); Oxidation; 2,4 dinitrotoluene; 2,4 dintroanisole; 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazol 5 one; aromatic nitro compound; explosive; heterocyclic compound; natural organic matter; organic matter; permanganate potassium; pyruvic acid; trinitrotoluene; unclassified drug; biotransformation; chemical alteration; chemical analysis; groundwater pollution; in situ measurement; nitrogen compound; organic matter; oxidation; potassium; reduction; soil pollution; trinitrotoluene; Article; biotransformation; centrifugation; cost effectiveness analysis; daughter; gas chromatography; nonhuman; oxidation; productivity; soil microflora","Field, J.A.; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, United States; email: jimfield@email.arizona.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

It addresses, in particular, problems where mission-critical performance is paramount, such as in aircraft, missiles, nuclear reactors and weapons, submarines, and many other types of systems where “failure” can result in overwhelming loss of life and property. The book is divided into four parts: Fundamentals, Electronics, Software, and Dangerous Goods. The first part on Fundamentals addresses general concepts of system safety engineering that are applicable to any type of system. The second part, Electronics, addresses the detection and correction of electronic hazards. In particular, the Bent Pin Problem, Sneak Circuit Problem, and related electrical problems are discussed with mathematical precision. The third part on Software addresses predicting software failure rates as well as detecting and correcting deep software logical flaws (called defects). The fourth part on Dangerous Goods presents solutions to three typical industrial chemical problems faced by the system safety engineer during the design, storage, and disposal phases of a dangerous goods’ life cycle. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Zito R.R.,7007088836;,Mathematical Foundations of System Safety Engineering: A Road Map for the Future,2019,Mathematical Foundations of System Safety Engineering: A Road Map for the Future,,,,1,347,NA,1,10.1007/978-3-030-26241-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146302266&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-26241-9&partnerID=40&md5=c9bc47fc1983cbf30e8c3eb74f937263,"Richard R.

Then the variation rules of size, mass, surface micro-topography, mechanical properties, thermal decomposition performance and mechanical sensitivity of the samples were investigated experimentally before and after high temperature (HT), low temperature (LT), high temperature cycle (HTC) and temperature shock (TS) tests, respectively. The results showed that the PBX columns, with the change rates of size and mass less than 1 %, were still at an acceptable level after temperature adaptability tests, and that the surface unevenness of the PBX samples followed the descending order of HT>HTC>LT>TS, which was in a good agreement with the order of mass loss. Moreover, the stability of the samples might be decreased by temperature adaptability tests, among which TS had the largest effect on both HNIW/CAB and HNIW/F                             2311                             .

The laser beam is expanded to illuminate the field of view of the HSRI and thereby improves large area scanning of suspicious surfaces. The collected hyperspectral image cube (HSI) is evaluated and classified using a random decision forest (RDF) algorithm. The RDF is trained with a training set of mg-amounts of different explosives, i.e., TNT, RDX, PETN, NaClO3, and NH4NO3, on an artificial aluminum substrate. The resulting classification is validated, and variable importance is used to optimize the RDF using spectral descriptors, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data set.

Then, the thermal stability of TNPG was studied by DSC and ARC experiments. The non-isothermal DSC results indicated that the thermal decomposition of TNPG overlapped with the endothermic melting process. The isothermal DSC and ARC results evidenced that the decomposition of TNPG followed the autocatalytic mechanism. Two different models were constructed to depict the decomposition process of TNPG.

2-s2.0-85065392704,"Ammonium nitrate (AN) propellants have attracted attention because of their low cost and ecofriendliness despite certain major disadvantages such as low burning rate, poor ignitability, low energy, and volume change due to phase transition of AN. The addition of nitramine to AN propellants is one of the approaches to overcome these disadvantages. However, AN/nitramine propellants are characterized by easy initiation, high sensitivity, and high detonation velocity because of the high energy of nitramine. The detonation properties of AN/nitramine propellants were investigated in this study. It was observed that the AN/nitramine propellant required a booster to detonate the propellants, as detonation did not occur while using only a commercial electric blasting cap. It was further observed that the detonation velocity (D) increased linearly as the mass of nitramine per unit propellant volume was increased, and AN had a negligible effect on the detonation properties. An approximate equation was derived from the relationship between D and the mass per unit propellant volume of nitramine. The dominant factors that can be used to estimate the detonation/no-detonation boundaries of the propellants were identified, and the experimental boundary equations were determined using these factors. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Kohga M., Shigi D., Beppu M.",7004699063;57208655023;7005082977;,Detonation properties of ammonium nitrate/nitramine-based composite propellants,2019,Journal of Energetic Materials,37,3,,309,319,NA,7,10.1080/07370652.2019.1607921,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065392704&doi=10.1080%2f07370652.2019.1607921&partnerID=40&md5=9476e4509cb8166411d9d0689369f69c,"Department of Applied Chemistry, National Defense Academy, Kanagawa, Japan; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National Defense Academy, Kanagawa, Japan","Kohga, M., Department of Applied Chemistry, National Defense Academy, Kanagawa, Japan; Shigi, D., Department of Applied Chemistry, National Defense Academy, Kanagawa, Japan; Beppu, M., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National Defense Academy, Kanagawa, Japan",Ammonium nitrate; composite propellant; detonation; HMX; RDX,,"Kohga, M.; Department of Applied Chemistry, 1-10-20 Hashirimizu, Japan; email: kohga@nda.ac.jp",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85070400840,"Rationale: The increased frequency in the number of international terror threats has led to a corresponding increase in demand for fast, sensitive and reliable screening methods suitable for the detection of airborne explosive vapors. We demonstrate herein a workflow suitable for the determination of nitrogen-based explosives at the picogram level in just minutes. Methods: A method is described that combines Thermal Desorption (TD) sample introduction with Differential Mobility Analysis (DMA) Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS), enabling a sensitive and accurate workflow suitable for the rapid detection of trace nitroaromatic, nitroester and nitramine explosive vapors. The methods are bridged using a novel low-flow, field-free Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization (APPI) source, intended specifically for the analysis of gas-phase analytes and airborne particles. Results: Limits of detection within or below the picogram range were determined for the analysis of a range of explosives standards including 2,6-DNT, TNT, TATB, Tetryl, RDX, EGDN, PETN, HMX, and NG. Practical application of the TD-APPI-DMA-MS/MS workflow was demonstrated for the detection of real trace explosive vapors produced from the volatilization of solid explosive samples stored within a sealed cardboard box. A single complete analysis was performed in less than 2 min. Conclusions: The highly sensitive and accurate detection of a variety of common nitrogen-based explosive vapors has been demonstrated, at levels suitable for practical, high-throughput security screening applications. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","McCulloch R.D., Amo-González M.",24574364800;57193547864;,Rapid detection of explosive vapors by thermal desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization differential mobility analysis tandem mass spectrometry,2019,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,33,18,,1455,1463,NA,8,10.1002/rcm.8492,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070400840&doi=10.1002%2frcm.8492&partnerID=40&md5=e30f110ed9b090d9f3b9e884b38f8414,"Dept. of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Sociedad Europea de Analisis Diferencial de Movilidad SL, Boecillo, Spain","McCulloch, R.D., Dept. of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Amo-González, M., Sociedad Europea de Analisis Diferencial de Movilidad SL, Boecillo, Spain",,Aromatic compounds; Atmospheric ionization; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Explosives detection; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen; Photoionization; Thermal desorption; Trace analysis; Atmospheric pressure photo ionization; Detection of explosives; Differential mobility analysis; Explosive vapors; Picogram level; Rapid detection; Screening methods; Tandem mass spectrometry; Tandem-mass spectrometry; Work-flows; Explosives,"McCulloch, R.D.; Dept. of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Canada; email: rmccullo@eos.ubc.ca",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85066984384,"The Department of Defense has invested in threat detection systems, consisting of sensors and algorithms to collect and process data on potential threats. We performed a Monte Carlo tradeoff analysis to determine the optimal combination of sensor versus algorithm capability for an airborne wide area motion imagery (WAMI) system used to identify insurgents detonating improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in urban environments. We created a computational model of the WAMI system, including the camera and algorithms for processing, exploitation, and dissemination. We also synthesized input data consisting of objects and activities taking place in a city over two days. We compared the model’s output versus input to quantify its overall value to the counter-IED mission. We exercised the model twice: forensically to identify insurgents after the IED explosions and prospectively to identify insurgents as early as possible beforehand. Although better sensors led to better intermediate results, they did not always lead to greater overall value. Once the number of true positives saturated at its best possible value, the number of false positives continued to grow as the quality of the sensor improved. Similar results may occur for other scenarios in which threats are limited in number with low prevalence. © The Author(s) 2017.","Cazares S., Snyder J.A., Cartier J., Sallis-Peterson F., Fregeau J.",6507276816;57209249605;57209260136;57209263423;6603242598;,A Monte Carlo tradeoff analysis to guide resource investment in threat detection systems: From forensic to prospective investigations,2019,Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,16,3,,297,320,NA,1,10.1177/1548512917694966,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066984384&doi=10.1177%2f1548512917694966&partnerID=40&md5=e7775fdcea284996cb55559b8196b6d9,"Institute for Defense Analyses, Systems and Analyses Center, United States; Institute for Defense Analyses, Center for Computing Sciences, United States","Cazares, S., Institute for Defense Analyses, Systems and Analyses Center, United States; Snyder, J.A., Institute for Defense Analyses, Systems and Analyses Center, United States; Cartier, J., Institute for Defense Analyses, Systems and Analyses Center, United States; Sallis-Peterson, F., Institute for Defense Analyses, Systems and Analyses Center, United States; Fregeau, J., Institute for Defense Analyses, Center for Computing Sciences, United States",activity detection; improvised explosive device; intelligence surveillance reconnaissance; Monte Carlo; pattern of life; processing exploitation dissemination; social network; tracking; tradeoff; wide area motion imagery,Explosives; Forensic science; Image enhancement; Monte Carlo methods; Social networking (online); Surface discharges; Wide area networks; Activity detection; Improvised explosive devices; intelligence surveillance reconnaissance; pattern of life; tradeoff; Wide-area motion imageries; Explosives detection,"Cazares, S.; Institute for Defense Analyses, United States; email: scazares@ida.org",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85069810582,"Overdriven detonation(ODD) means that the detonation process of explosives no longer follows the C−J detonation process and its detonation parameters are larger than the C−J values. ODD is an unstable detonation process. With the increasing of propagation distance, detonation parameters tend to C−J value gradually. The double-layer shaped charge (DLSC) with high detonation velocity explosive (HE) in the outer layer and low detonation velocity explosive (LE) in the inner layer can keep the axis of shaped charge in the ODD state all the time. The paper derived formulas for calculating the parameters of overdriven detonation when the HE detonates the LE. Based on the conservation of momentum, mass and energy, the functional relationship between the intensity of Mach wave and the incident angle of the detonation wave in the shaped charge is deduced. Study on the propagation law of detonation waves in DLSC with the wave shaper by numerical simulation. The results show that the peak value of Mach wave pressure in DLSC is not increased compared with that in ordinary shaped charge (OSC), but the attenuation speed of Mach wave pressure can be delayed and ultimately in the ODD state. The final parameters of the ODD state are determined by the detonation velocity and the polytropic exponent of the explosive. The results of numerical simulation are consistent with theoretical calculation, which confirms the accuracy of the formulas. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It focuses on the charges that contain inert elements made of materials in which a sound velocity is significantly higher than a detonation velocity. It also summarizes the results of experimental, numerical, and theoretical investigations of explosion systems, which contain high modulus ceramic components. The phenomena occurring in such systems are described in detail: desensitization of high explosives, nonstationary detonation processes, energy focusing, and Mach stems formation. Formation of hypersonic flows of ceramic particles arising due to explosive collapse of ceramic tubes is another example of the issues discussed. Explosion Systems with Inert High Modulus Components: Increasing the Efficiency of Blast Technologies and Their Applications also looks at the design of explosion protective structures based on high modulus ceramic materials. The structural transformations, caused in metallic materials by the energy focusing, or by the impact of hypersonic ceramic jets are also discussed. These transformations include, but not limited to adiabatic shear banding, phase transformations, mechanical twinning, melting, boiling, and even evaporation of the impacted substrates. Specifically discusses in one volume the explosions involved with inert high modules components normally scattered over numerous journal articles Covers methods to increase energy output of a weak explosive by encasing it in a higher explosive Discusses the specifics of explosive systems containing high modulus inert elements Details the process of detonation and related phenomena, as well as the design of novel highly performant explosive systems Describes the transformation in materials impacted due to explosion in such systems Explosion Systems with Inert High Modulus Components will be of great interest to specialists working in fields of energy of the explosion and explosion safety as well as university staff, students, and postgraduate students studying explosion phenomena, explosive technologies, explosion safety, and materials science. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Balagansky I.A., Bataev A.A., Bataev I.A.",9235380200;6701616456;24723460800;,Explosion systems with inert high-modulus components: Increasing the efficiency of blast technologies and their applications,2019,Explosion Systems with Inert High-Modulus Components: Increasing the Efficiency of Blast Technologies and Their Applications,,,,1,214,NA,4,10.1002/9781119525462,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092755164&doi=10.1002%2f9781119525462&partnerID=40&md5=fbf1923f31b3251a02e7798db95c6813,"Department of Novosibirsk State Technical University, United States; University and professor of Materials Science Department, United States","Balagansky, I.A., Department of Novosibirsk State Technical University, United States; Bataev, A.A., University and professor of Materials Science Department, United States; Bataev, I.A., Department of Novosibirsk State Technical University, United States",,,"Balagansky, I.A.; Department of Novosibirsk State Technical UniversityUnited States",Book,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Within the context of military route clearance, the system automatically detects suspicious changes in the environment with respect to a previous patrol. For this purpose, historical images of the live scene are retrieved from a database and registered to the live image through 2.5-D view synthesis, using the three-dimensional (3-D) scene geometry acquired from a stereo camera. Changes are then found using local-area statistics in the CIE-Lab color space. A set of spatiotemporal filters is used to reject irrelevant alarms, resulting in a limited set of confident changes to be presented to the operator through an interactive graphical user interface. Next to the algorithmic contributions, we elaborate on the real-time design, featuring graphical processing units for the most time-consuming processing tasks, a pipelined architecture to increase the system throughput, and we split the system into a live and offline processing chain. This way, real-time change detection at 3.5 fps is achieved on images of 1920 × 1440 pixels.

2-s2.0-85072942822,"A spatial heterodyne Raman spectrometer (SHRS), constructed using a modular optical cage and lens tube system, is described for use with a commercial silica and a custom single-crystal (SC) sapphire fiber Raman probe. The utility of these fiber-coupled SHRS chemical sensors is demonstrated using 532 nm laser excitation for acquiring Raman measurements of solid (sulfur) and liquid (cyclohexane) Raman standards as well as real-world, plastic-bonded explosives (PBX) comprising 1,3,5- triamino- 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene (TATB) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) energetic materials. The SHRS is a fixed grating-based dispersive interferometer equipped with an array detector. Each Raman spectrum was extracted from its corresponding fringe image (i.e., interferogram) using a Fourier transform method. Raman measurements were acquired with the SHRS Littrow wavelength set at the laser excitation wavelength over a spectral range of ∼1750 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of ∼8 cm−1 for sapphire and ∼10 cm−1 for silica fiber probes. The large aperture of the SHRS allows much larger fiber diameters to be used without degrading spectral resolution as demonstrated with the larger sapphire collection fiber diameter (330 μm) compared to the silica fiber (100 μm). Unlike the dual silica fiber Raman probe, the dual sapphire fiber Raman probe did not include filtering at the fiber probe tip nearest the sample. Even so, SC sapphire fiber probe measurements produced less background than silica fibers allowing Raman measurements as close as ∼85 cm−1 to the excitation laser. Despite the short lengths of sapphire fiber used to construct the sapphire probe, well-defined, sharp sapphire Raman bands at 420, 580, and 750 cm−1 were observed in the SHRS spectra of cyclohexane and the highly fluorescent HMX-based PBX. SHRS measurements of the latter produced low background interference in the extracted Raman spectrum because the broad band fluorescence (i.e., a direct current, or DC, component) does not contribute to the interferogram intensity (i.e., the alternating current, or AC, component). SHRS spectral resolution, throughput, and signal-to-noise ratio are also discussed along with the merits of using sapphire Raman bands as internal performance references and as internal wavelength calibration standards in Raman measurements. © The Author(s) 2019.","Ottaway J.M., Allen A., Waldron A., Paul P.H., Angel S.M., Carter J.C.",35799821900;57203023092;57211195312;7202714137;7005907627;7403989370;,Spatial Heterodyne Raman Spectrometer (SHRS) for In Situ Chemical Sensing Using Sapphire and Silica Optical Fiber Raman Probes,2019,Applied Spectroscopy,73,10,,1160,1171,NA,7,10.1177/0003702819868237,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072942822&doi=10.1177%2f0003702819868237&partnerID=40&md5=86412b0723d1153f3d9093860ba4e0ff,"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States","Ottaway, J.M., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Allen, A., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States; Waldron, A., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States; Paul, P.H., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States; Angel, S.M., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States; Carter, J.C., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States",Fourier transform Raman; FT Raman; HMX; optical fiber; PBX; Raman probe; Raman spectroscopy; sapphire fiber; spatial heterodyne Raman spectrometer; TATB,Chemical sensors; Cyclohexane; Fluorescence; HMX; Interferometry; Laser excitation; Lenses; Optical fibers; Optical heterodyning; Private telephone exchanges; Probes; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Signal to noise ratio; Silica; Single crystals; Spectral resolution; Spectrometers; Fourier transform Raman; FT-Raman; Raman probe; Raman spectrometers; Sapphire fiber; TATB; Sapphire,"Carter, J.C.; Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States; email: carter45@llnl.gov",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85084077297,"In this study, a siderophore, pyoverdine (PVD), has been isolated from Pseudomonas sp. and used to develop a fluorescence quenching-based sensor for efficient detection of nitrotriazolone (NTO) in aqueous media, in contrast to other explosives such as research department explosive (RDX), picric acid, and trinitrotoulene (TNT). The siderophore PVD exhibited enhanced fluorescence quenching above 50% at 470 nm for a minimal concentration (38 nM) of NTO. The limit of detection estimated from interpolating the graph of fluorescence intensity (at 470 nm) versus NTO concentration is found to be 12 nM corresponding to 18% quenching. The time delay fluorescence spectroscopy of the PVD-NTO solution showed a negligible change of 0.09 ns between the minimum and maximum NTO concentrations. The in silico absorption at the emission peak of static fluorescence remains invariant upon the addition of NTO. The computational studies revealed the formation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between the energetically stable complexes of PVD and NTO. Although the analysis of Stern-Volmer plots and computational studies imply that the quenching mechanism is a combination of both dynamic and static quenching, the latter is dominant over the earlier. The static quenching is attributed to ground-state complex formation, as supported by the computational analysis. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Kulkarni P.A., Nandre V., Kumbhar N., Khade R., Urmode T., Kodam K.M., More M.A.",57215934309;55486602600;38862062700;39361537300;55856006800;57202945693;7007053648;,NTO Sensing by Fluorescence Quenching of a Pyoverdine Siderophore - A Mechanistic Approach,2020,ACS Omega,,,,,,NA,3,10.1021/acsomega.9b03844,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084077297&doi=10.1021%2facsomega.9b03844&partnerID=40&md5=fd667df0cf665646cd8f76334d7c1b03,"Department of Physics, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India","Kulkarni, P.A., Department of Physics, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Nandre, V., Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Kumbhar, N., Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Khade, R., Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Urmode, T., Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; Kodam, K.M., Department of Chemistry, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India; More, M.A., Department of Physics, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India",,,"More, M.A.; Department of Physics, India; email: mam@physics.unipune.ac.in",Article,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85100820169,"1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) is one of the most powerful military explosives that is produced by means of Bechmann method. Simultaneous, 1,3,5-rinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) as a by-product is produced in this method that affect on the purity and sensitivity of HMX. Using a simple and fast technique is important for determination of trace amounts of RDX in the HMX matrix. The technique of gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was proposed for these reasons. Because the presence of several parameters in the proposed technique, the experimental design methods of factorial and central composite were used for the experiments of screening and optimization, respectively. The parameters of oven programming, injection volume, injection temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and detector temperature were used in experiments of screening. The analysis of variance and Pareto plots showed that the injection temperature and carrier gas flow rate must be optimized among the parameters.

2-s2.0-85096351923,"Trace detection and identification of hazardous volatile explosives has been a key challenge to the scientific community past many decades. Commercially available various analytical and spectroscopic techniques suffer from low sensitivity, swabbing of surfaces and low detection limit. Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), used in improvised explosive devices IEDs vaporizes readily at room temperature and has a vapour signature. However, explosive trace detectors (ETDs) are incompetent to detect TATP due to absence of chromophoric groups. We have investigated the novel hollow core photonic crystal fibres (HC-PCFs) based Raman sensor for real time monitoring of such volatile explosives in airport security. Raman scattering, a powerful, non-destructive tool provides molecular fingerprinting and is a potential candidate for detection of trace explosives but suffer from weak signal strength. Simultaneous confinement of pumped light and gas in HCFs allows greater light gas interaction providing an excellent optical sensing platform. These sensors can be easily incorporated at the security terminals or baggage counters with the existing metal detection systems. This paper reports investigations carried out on the HC-PCF designed using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The Raman signal being dependent on its intensity and mode area, simulations were conducted to analyse PCF parameters like confinement losses and mode field diameter/ effective mode area and its associated wavelength dependency. Theoretical study carried out on the HC-PCF also revealed that mode field confinements within the hollow core can be modified to suit specific laser wavelengths and confinement losses can be reduced to achieve Raman signal enhancement by optimizing their geometrical parameters like air-hole size and pitch/ hole-to-hole distance. © 2020 SPIE","Johny J., Karnik S., Prabhu R.",55391425700;57219973543;36632887700;,Investigations on Hollow Core Photonic Crystal Fibres (HC-PCF) for trace explosive vapour detection,2020,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,11542,,115420Q,,,NA,2,10.1117/12.2574356,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096351923&doi=10.1117%2f12.2574356&partnerID=40&md5=7fe258bb50c9b0be4f108d4fa39757a8,"School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7GJ, United Kingdom","Johny, J., School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7GJ, United Kingdom; Karnik, S., School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7GJ, United Kingdom; Prabhu, R., School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7GJ, United Kingdom",Computational modelling; Hollow core photonic crystal fibres (HC-PCF); Improvised explosive devices IEDs; Mode field confinement; Mode field diameter; Raman scattering; TATP; Trace vapor detection,Airport security; Chromium compounds; Crystal whiskers; Explosives; Explosives detection; Geometry; Metal detectors; Photonic crystals; Raman spectroscopy; Terrorism; Trace analysis; Explosive trace detectors; Hollow-core photonic crystal fibre; Improvised explosive devices; Metal detection systems; Molecular fingerprinting; Spectroscopic technique; Triacetone triperoxide; Wavelength dependency; Photonic crystal fibers,,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85075999255,"Among all the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) known, pipe bombs are one of the most popular devices used by terrorists. They are simple to use, easy to construct and materials are readily available. For this IED, fragmentation is the primary injury mechanism, which makes them a desirable weapon for terrorists aiming to inflict maximum human casualties. Although the investigation of fragmentation pattern is not novel, there is limited data available on pipe bombs performance in the open literature. Therefore, this research is looking at validating results in current literature, which showed limited repetition and weak experimental design so far; by trial with six pipe bombs with two different thickness (3 of each). The pipe bombs consisted of mild steel casing and aluminised ammonium nitrate as the explosive filler. Fragments were collected, with an average recovery of 72%, and measured regarding mass and velocity. The experiment results show a correlation between the pipe thickness and both the size and velocity of fragments. © 2019","da Silva L.A., Johnson S., Critchley R., Clements J., Norris K., Stennett C.",57212139320;57212136881;57211455449;57212149580;57212141432;23973443000;,Experimental fragmentation of pipe bombs with varying case thickness,2020,Forensic Science International,306,,110034,,,NA,8,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.110034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075999255&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2019.110034&partnerID=40&md5=7cf11d50442471fb9d60c9f258f45da5,"Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom","da Silva, L.A., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Johnson, S., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Critchley, R., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Clements, J., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Norris, K., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom; Stennett, C., Department of Defence and Security, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United Kingdom",Forensic science; Fragmentation; Pipe bombs,aluminized ammonium nitrate; aluminum derivative; ammonium nitrate; filler; steel; unclassified drug; Article; bomb; controlled study; experimental design; experimental study; explosion; forensic science; fragmentation; physical phenomena; pipe bomb; priority journal; thickness; velocity,"Johnson, S.; Department of Defence and Security, United Kingdom; email: steve_johnson824@yahoo.co.uk",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85072701146,"In the fields of Security and Defense, explosive traces must be analyzed at the sites of the terrorist events. The persistence on surfaces of these traces depends on the sublimation processes and the interactions with the surfaces. This study presents evidence that the sublimation process of these traces on stainless steel (SS) surfaces is very different than in bulk quantities. The enthalpies of sublimation of traces of four highly energetic materials: triacetone triperoxide (TATP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 1,3,5- trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) deposited on SS substrates were determined by optical fiber coupled-grazing angle probe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. These were compared with enthalpies of sublimation determined by thermal gravimetric analysis for bulk amounts and differences between them were found. The sublimation enthalpy of RDX was very different for traces than for bulk quantities, attributed to two main factors. First, the beta-RDX phase was present at trace levels, unlike the case of bulk amounts which consisted only of the alpha-RDX phase. Second, an interaction between the RDX and SS was found. This interaction energy was determined using grazing angle FTIR microscopy. In the case of DNT and TNT, bulk and traces enthalpies were statistically similar, but it is evidenced that at the level of traces a metastable phase was observed. Finally, for TATP the enthalpies were statistically identical, but a non-linear behavior and a change of heat capacity values different from zero was found for both trace and bulk phases. ©2019 by the authors.","Pacheco-Londoño L.C., Ruiz-Caballero J.L., Ramírez-Cedeño M.L., Infante-Castillo R., Gálan-Freyle N.J., Hernández-Rivera S.P.",7003783695;57190172412;8954530700;14121529400;55795361700;57204205788;,Surface persistence of trace level deposits of highly energetic materials,2019,Molecules,24,19,3494,,,NA,4,10.3390/molecules24193494,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072701146&doi=10.3390%2fmolecules24193494&partnerID=40&md5=99c77cd50cc6c04872ae48b2b71aa962,"R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States; School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Atlantico, 080020, Colombia; Joseph Smith and Sons Inc., Capitol Heights, MD  20743, United States; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA  22030, United States; Department of Physics-Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo, PR  00614, United States","Pacheco-Londoño, L.C., R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States, School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Atlantico, 080020, Colombia; Ruiz-Caballero, J.L., R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States, Joseph Smith and Sons Inc., Capitol Heights, MD  20743, United States, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA  22030, United States; Ramírez-Cedeño, M.L., R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States; Infante-Castillo, R., Department of Physics-Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo, PR  00614, United States; Gálan-Freyle, N.J., R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States, School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Atlantico, 080020, Colombia; Hernández-Rivera, S.P., R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus, Mayaguez, PR  00681, United States",Explosive; FTIR; Grazing angle; Sublimation; Thermogravimetric analysis,"explosive; algorithm; chemical model; chemistry; infrared spectroscopy; synthesis; thermogravimetry; X ray diffraction; Algorithms; Explosive Agents; Models, Chemical; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Thermogravimetry; X-Ray Diffraction","Pacheco-Londoño, L.C.; R3-C Research and Education Component of ALERT DHS Center of Excellence for Explosives Research, United States; email: leonardo.pacheco@unisimonbolivar.edu.co",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85062472841,"Explosive contamination is commonly found at military and manufacturing sites (Hewitt et al., 2005; Clausen et al., 2004; Walsh et al., 2013). Under current environmental legislation the extent of the contamination must be characterized by soil sampling and subsequent separation of the explosive contaminants from the soil matrix by extraction to enable chemical analysis and quantification (Dean, 2009). It is essential that the extraction method can consistently recover explosive residue from a variety of soil types i.e. all materials that have not degraded or irreversibly bound to the matrix, so that any resultant risk is not underestimated. In this study, five different soil types with a range of organic content, particle size and pH, were spiked with a mixture of RDX, DNAN, NQ and NTO at 50 mg/kg and were extracted using one of four one-step extraction methods: stirring, shaking, sonication, and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Analysis of the extraction efficiencies of the four methods found that they were broadly successful for the extraction of all IHE constituents from all five soils (an average of 84% ± 14% recovery across 80 extractions). However, soils with high organic content (Total Organic Content (TOC) ≥ 2%) were found to significantly affect extraction efficiency and reproducibility. NTO and DNAN were the least consistent in extraction efficiency with poorest recovery of NTO as low as 37% ± 2%. Of the four tested methods shaking was found to be the most reproducible, though less efficient than stirring (64%–91%). ASE was found to have the most variable results for extraction of IHE constituents suggesting that ASE was the most affected by the different soil types. Therefore, it is recommended that the efficiency and reproducibility of the selected extraction method should be validated by extracting known concentrations of the IHE from the soil of interest and that any required correction factors are reported. © 2019","Temple T., Cipullo S., Galante E., Ladyman M., Mai N., Parry T., Coulon F.",56180873000;57191894356;35748586900;57192157837;57192154121;57207348571;55887153000;,The effect of soil type on the extraction of insensitive high explosive constituents using four conventional methods,2019,Science of the Total Environment,668,,,184,192,NA,6,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.359,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062472841&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.02.359&partnerID=40&md5=a6de6b35c9cddb86eb1a1bf93066fb76,"Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Cranfield University, School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield, MK43 0AL, United Kingdom","Temple, T., Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Cipullo, S., Cranfield University, School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield, MK43 0AL, United Kingdom; Galante, E., Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Ladyman, M., Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Mai, N., Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Parry, T., Cranfield University, Centre for Defence Chemistry, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 7LA, United Kingdom; Coulon, F., Cranfield University, School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield, MK43 0AL, United Kingdom","1‑Nitroguanidine (NQ); 2,4‑Dinitroanisole (DNAN); 3,5‑Trinitroperhydro‑1,3,5‑triazine (RDX); 3‑Nitro‑1,2,4‑triazolin‑5‑one (NTO); Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE)",Chemical analysis; Efficiency; Explosives; Particle size; Recovery; Soils; Solvent extraction; Accelerated solvent extraction; Conventional methods; Environmental legislations; Extraction efficiencies; Insensitive high explosive; Nitroguanidine; One-step extraction methods; Total organic contents; Soil pollution; explosive; extraction method; organic compound; particle size; pH; soil pollution; soil type; solvent; article; particle size; reproducibility; soil; solvent extraction; ultrasound,"Temple, T.; Cranfield University, United Kingdom; email: t.temple@cranfield.ac.uk",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85074886022,"The development of a rapid, sensitive, and selective real-time detection method for explosives traces may have an enormous impact on civilian national security, military applications, and environmental monitoring. However, real-time sensing of explosives still possesses a huge analytical hurdle, rendering explosives detection an issue of burning immediacy and an enormous current challenge in terms of research and development. Even though several explosives detection methods have been established, these approaches are typically time-consuming, need relatively large equipment, demand sample preparation, require a skilled operator, and lack the capability to do high-throughput real-time detection, thus strongly constraining their mass deployment. Here, we demonstrate the use of amino-modified carbon microfiber (μCF) working electrodes for ultrasensitive, selective, and multiplex detection of nitro-based explosives. Furthermore, our sensing method works at high sampling rates by a single electrode in a single detection cycle. We hereby present the first demonstration of porous μCF electrodes used for the simultaneous collection/preconcentration of explosive molecular species through direct air sampling, followed by the electrochemical detection of the surface adsorbed electroactive species. Our chemically modified μCF electrodes allow straightforward vapor-phase detection and discrimination of multiple nitro-based explosives directly from collected air samples. Hence, our sensing approach has been shown highly effective in the ultratrace detection of nitro-based explosives, under real-world conditions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Krivitsky V., Filanovsky B., Bourenko T., Granot E., Praiz A., Patolsky F.",55359906500;6507052520;6603160338;7006731491;56328099000;7004136027;,Vapor Trace Collection and Direct Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitro-Explosives by 3D Microstructured Electrodes,2019,Analytical Chemistry,,,,,,NA,8,10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02849,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074886022&doi=10.1021%2facs.analchem.9b02849&partnerID=40&md5=8f4f8bad14dcb240dec311f67d7d2114,"School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel","Krivitsky, V., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Filanovsky, B., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Bourenko, T., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Granot, E., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Praiz, A., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Patolsky, F., School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel",,Air quality; Electrochemical electrodes; Explosives; Military applications; National security; Signal detection; Electroactive species; ELectrochemical detection; Environmental Monitoring; Microstructured electrodes; Multiplex detections; Nitro-based explosives; Research and development; Ultrasensitive detection; Explosives detection,"Patolsky, F.; School of Chemistry, Israel; email: fernando@post.tau.ac.il",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85077525756,"The detection and analysis of hazardous materials through opaque barriers is important for law enforcement agencies. Conventional Raman spectroscopy provides fingerprint signatures of materials but lacks the ability to detect materials through opaque containers. Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) overcomes the limitation of conventional Raman spectroscopy and allows the detection of materials through most commercial bottles and packaging materials. Moreover, SORS has the potential to detect hazardous materials through colored glass bottles, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, Teflon layers, etc., which is required in the screening of commercial packaging at airports and other vital facilities. SORS was investigated in the visible range with a 532-nm excitation source for the detection of urea and sodium nitrate through commercial packaging, i.e., a white HDPE bottle with a thickness of 1 mm. The effects of the spatial offset and integration time on the Raman spectra of the contents and container were evaluated. The trend of the change in the relative contributions from the contents and container was studied by varying the offset and integration time.

A sensor array based on an individual TiO2/Aphen sensor is constructed by regulating the excitation wavelength (365 nm, 450 nm, 550 nm). TiO2/Aphen shows significant response to nitroaromatic explosives since the Aphen capped on the surface of TiO2 can chemically recognize and absorb nitroaromatic explosives by the formation of the corresponding Meisenheimer complex. The photocatalytic mechanism is proved to be the primary sensing mechanism after anchoring nitroaromatic explosives to TiO2 . The fingerprint patterns obtained by combining kinetics and thermodynamics validated that the single TiO2/Aphen sensor can identify at least six nitroaromatic explosives and improvised explosives within 8 s and the biggest response reaches 80%.

In this chapter, four spectroscopic laser based techniques are presented highlighting working principles and capabilities in discriminating explosive compounds at trace level, in field operation, locally or remotely. For each techniques, the detection limits and drawbacks are reported in the application to trace sensing. Such electro-optics tools do not aim to replace the traditional laboratory methods, rather to support them in security applications and in narrowing the area under investigation, reducing the number of samples selected for laboratory analysis.

2-s2.0-85086757228,"Tetrazene [1-(5-tetrazolyl)-4-guanyltetrazene hydrate] is widely used in ordnance systems as a sensitizer of primer compositions, for use in both percussion and stab applications. It can be synthesized by reacting aminoguanidinium bicarbonate (AGB) with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in the presence of acetic acid. However, little is known about its optimal synthesis parameters in the manufacturing process. In this study, Taguchi's experimental design method was used to further improve the yield of tetrazene. Under the condition that the molar ratio of AGB to NaNO2 was fixed at 1.0:1.2, a L9(33) orthogonal array with three control factors and three levels for each control factor was used to design nine experimental conditions. The experimental data were transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio to analyze and evaluate the experimental conditions of the optimal parameter combination for the maximum yield of tetrazene. Verification of the results indicated that the optimal synthesis parameters were as follows: pH value of AGB solution was 5.0, reaction temperature was 35 °C and reaction time was 6 h; the maximum yield of tetrazene could reach 83.7%. Furthermore, the synthesized tetrazene was identified and characterized by elemental analysis (EA), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), optical microscopy (OM), particle size distribution analysis (PSDA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and its impact sensitivity was determined using a BAM Fallhammer apparatus and the Bruceton analysis method. © 2020 Lukasiewicz Research Network-Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry, Poland.","Li J.-S., Chang C.-C., Lu K.-T.",36707952200;57217210049;7402892955;,Optimization of the synthesis parameters and analysis of the impact sensitivity for tetrazene explosive,2020,Central European Journal of Energetic Materials,17,1,,5,19,NA,5,10.22211/CEJEM/118512,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086757228&doi=10.22211%2fCEJEM%2f118512&partnerID=40&md5=00bae36f7168103d43628f00b399b2c0,"Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Master Program of Chemical Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Li, J.-S., Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Chang, C.-C., Master Program of Chemical Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Lu, K.-T., Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Optimal synthesis parameters; Taguchi design method; Tetrazene; Yield,Differential scanning calorimetry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molar ratio; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Particle size; pH; Signal to noise ratio; Sodium compounds; Experimental conditions; Experimental design method; Impact sensitivities; Manufacturing process; Optimal parameter combinations; Particle size distribution analysis; Reaction temperature; Signal to noise (S/N) ratios; Particle size analysis,"Li, J.-S.; Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Taiwan; email: lijinshuh@gmail.com",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

The proposed EOS was implemented in LS-DYNA as a user defined EOS and validated by simulating the experiments of metal plates acceleration caused by detonation of RDX-based aluminized explosives. The numerical results reproduce the experimental finding that the reaction rate of aluminum particles increases with the decrease of aluminum particle size. The proposed EOS has several advantages over the previously reported equations of state for aluminized explosives. The reaction rate of aluminum constituents is calculated theoretically from their gasification reaction rate equation eliminating the need for experimental calibration of the corresponding empirical parameters. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The interaction between LCOF-BTT1 and nitrobenzene has been investigated by DFT and TDDFT methods. By studying electronic configurations and frontier molecular orbitals, the luminescence mechanism of LCOF-BTT1 has changed due to the hydrogen bonding formed between LCOF-BTT1 and nitrobenzene (Complex 1). Further study of electronic transition energies, hydrogen bond lengths, 1H NMR and IR spectra of Complex 1 reveals that hydrogen bonding is stronger in the excited state than in the ground state, indicating fluorescence quenching. Furthermore, the fluorescence rate coefficient and the internal conversion rate coefficient of Complex 1 are correspondingly decreased and increased, indicating that the increase in the strength of hydrogen bonding in the excited state is beneficial to the non-radiative transition and is not conducive to the radiation transition. © 2019","Xu Y., Song X., Hao C.",57211013316;25621619700;7102978004;,LCOFs: Role of the excited state hydrogen bonding in the detection for nitro-explosives,2019,Journal of Luminescence,215,,116733,,,NA,7,10.1016/j.jlumin.2019.116733,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072254650&doi=10.1016%2fj.jlumin.2019.116733&partnerID=40&md5=06a0d8041ebc6a3c7e33a147332d8e48,"State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China","Xu, Y., State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; Song, X., State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; Hao, C., State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China",Detection mechanism; Fluorescence quenching; Hydrogen bonding; Luminescent covalent organic frameworks; Nitro-explosives; TDDFT,Excited states; Explosives; Explosives detection; Fluorescence; Fluorescence quenching; Ground state; Molecular orbitals; Nitrobenzene; Quenching; Covalent organic frameworks; Detection mechanism; Electronic transition energies; Excited state hydrogen bondings; Frontier molecular orbitals; Internal conversion rates; Non-radiative transitions; TDDFT; Hydrogen bonds,"Song, X.; State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, China; email: song@dlut.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

With lots of novel applications arising from this field, Forensic science seems to be one of the fast-growing fields in nano research applications. The growing and extensive use of nanotechnology being applied in forensic investigations is promising and could soon be the tipping point in the discipline. Applications mainly have been related to evidence identification and analysis in the broad major fields in Forensic Science such as single-crystalline semiconductor CdS nano slabs for explosives detection, functionalized TiO2 nanorods for organophosphorus chemical warfare agents in Forensic Chemistry, the use of Na-nopowders for latent print visualization in Forensic physics and Gold nanoparticle protein nanopore for detection of single-stranded DNA in Forensic biology.

2-s2.0-85072610663,"In the Netherlands, the illegal use of powerful flash bangers is popular and as a result these items are frequently encountered in forensic casework. In collaboration with the Dutch police a representative sample set of the most frequently confiscated flash bangers, the Cobra 6 and Cobra 6 2G, has previously been collected also including imitation items. Classification of the different flash bangers was performed by analysing the pyrotechnic charge using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with indirect UV-detection. Two rapid CE methods were used to determine the anions and cations present in the pyrotechnic mixtures. Black and flash powders were easily distinguishable based on their main inorganic compositions, i.e., KNO3 and KClO4, respectively. Differentiation of flash powders from the commercial and imitation pyrotechnic items was achieved by the identification of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cation traces in the imitation flash banger powders. Quantitative CE results were used to explore the possibilities to differentiate seized sets of flash bangers but this proved to be difficult for commercial items due to lack of impurities and uniform production processes. In addition, inherent inhomogeneity of the powders and incomplete sample extraction yielded a relative high measurement uncertainty within a set. For the imitation items potential for set-based differentiation was observed. Although the number of seized imitation sets was limited, a first step has been taken to classify pyrotechnic mixtures to provide additional information and intelligence in forensic casework of flash bangers. © 2019 The Authors.

Data obtained by heat flow calorimetry on nitrocellulose-based propellants have been reviewed with the aim of identifying improved chemical compatibility assessment criteria. It was shown that relative and absolute assessment techniques could give contrary sentencing. It was concluded that basing the assessment on the absolute criteria would have the advantage that alternative test temperatures and durations could be utilised. After 7 days at 85 °C the increase in the absolute heat flow of the mixture should be <15 J g                             −1                              in order to be assessed as compatible.

2-s2.0-85074371619,"The component mass ratio and moisture of nitrate ester mixtures are crucial technical indicators for the industrial applications and safety performance evaluation. Thus an accurate, fast and simple 1H quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) method was developed for the determination of the component mass ratio and moisture of butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN) and nitroglycerin (NG) nitrate ester mixture simultaneously. By using the NMR ERETIC module technique, the effect of water in solvent and internal standard was eliminated by integral value subtraction method, and the moisture content in BTTN/NG nitrate ester mixture can be accurately calculated. The method enables the determination of component mass ratio and moisture in 10 min of analysis with great linearity (r2≥0.999), high precision (RSD<1.5%) and excellent recovery (from 99.79% to 101.3%). For nitrate ester explosive with the high energy and sensitivity, the low dosage of qNMR method could effectively avoid the explosion and combustion hazard of traditional methods. The accuracy of qNMR method was validated with HPLC and Karl-Fisher method, respectively, and no statistical difference was found in comparison with the results obtained by qNMR method. Therefore, the developed qNMR method is reliable and accurate for the quality control of BTTN/NG nitrate ester mixture. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Liu K., Wang M., Xu M., Meng Z., Chang H., Zhang G., Chen Z., Zhang L.",57201119425;18538832100;55653785400;7201894774;16308899200;13006149000;55653597100;57189334412;,Determination of the component mass ratio and moisture in BTTN/NG nitrate ester mixture simultaneously by qNMR and method validation,2020,Microchemical Journal,152,,104337,,,NA,4,10.1016/j.microc.2019.104337,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074371619&doi=10.1016%2fj.microc.2019.104337&partnerID=40&md5=ae9d31074c74bdadea043a7334231074,"School of Chemical Engineering and the Environment, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 10081, China; Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China","Liu, K., School of Chemical Engineering and the Environment, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 10081, China, Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Wang, M., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Xu, M., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Meng, Z., School of Chemical Engineering and the Environment, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 10081, China; Chang, H., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Zhang, G., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Chen, Z., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China; Zhang, L., Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute, Xi'an, 710065, China",BTTN; Method validation; NG; Nitrate ester; qNMR,,"Meng, Z.; School of Chemical Engineering and the Environment, China; email: mengzh@bit.edu.cn",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85061036436,"This chapter provides a brief overview of the main directions in research and application of the interaction of laser radiation with explosives. Historically the first application of such interaction based on thermal initiation of explosives is briefly characterized. The main methods of remote detection of explosives using laser radiation are listed. Particular attention is paid to the areas of research that have been recently formed such as spectral selective resonance interaction of laser radiation with explosives and explosives modified by nano-additives. It was noted that depending on the choice of the optical absorption band of the explosives, its excitation can lead either to the effective activation of an explosive or to its decomposition, which is not accompanied by a significant thermal effect. The latter case can be used for remote detection of the explosives and, partly, for passivation of their surface. Finally, it was demonstrated that the absorbing and refractive light nano-additives are able to reduce the threshold intensity of initiation of explosives by laser radiation, while keeping the resistance of explosives to impact or thermal effects that provides the safety conditions of working with them. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tverjanovich Y., Tverjanovich A., Averyanov A., Panov M., Ilyshin M., Balmakov M.",35595208900;57216909794;57193328059;35311716300;6603596015;57195289378;,"Interaction of laser radiation with explosives, applications and perspectives",2019,Springer Series in Chemical Physics,119,,,493,511,NA,4,10.1007/978-3-030-05974-3_25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061036436&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-05974-3_25&partnerID=40&md5=8374aef1708722d855cb0ca525025552,"Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; St. Petersburg State Institute of Technology, Moskovsky ave. 26, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation","Tverjanovich, Y., Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Tverjanovich, A., Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Averyanov, A., Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Panov, M., Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Ilyshin, M., St. Petersburg State Institute of Technology, Moskovsky ave. 26, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Balmakov, M., Institute of Chemistry, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskiy ave. 28, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation",,,"Tverjanovich, Y.; Institute of Chemistry, Universitetskiy ave. 28, Russian Federation; email: y.tveryanovich@spbu.ru",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85068162459,"Surface texture tailoring has the potential to increase the effectiveness of dry particle collection wipes, as a wipe's topographical features control the intimate surface contact made with particles on the substrate (critical for van der Waals-governed adhesion). However, texture-tailoring approaches have not yet been widely explored, in part because of a lack of understanding of the specific wipe topographies and wipe/particle interactions that maximize particle collection. Here we describe an in situ optical microscopy technique that enables direct observation of micrometer-scale particle-wipe interactions occurring at the wipe-substrate interface during contact sampling. The technique is demonstrated for nonwoven meta-aramid (Nomex) collection wipes with particles ranging from 1 to 90 μm in diameter and substrates of different topographies (glass and nylon coil zipper). Experiments with hemispherically coated Janus particles allow rolling motions to be distinguished from sliding motions, providing detailed information about how particles move prior to capture or release by the wipe. Particle-fiber and particle-particle interactions are seen to play important roles in particle capture, suggesting that conventional sphere-on-plane models are inadequate to describe adhesion behavior in these systems. Micrographs show how loose, flexible fibers in roughened textile wipes interrogate the valleys of uneven substrate topographies, allowing capture of particles that might otherwise be trapped within the substrate's grooves and depressions. The materials used in this work are specifically relevant to explosives detection, but the in situ visualization technique is transferable for the study of any application involving dry particle collection, such as toxic substance sampling and dust removal. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Liddell H.P.H., Merrill M.H.",54883163600;26533152400;,In Situ Visualization of Particle Motions during Wipe Sampling of Explosives and Other Trace Particulate Materials,2019,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,11,26,,23780,23788,NA,6,10.1021/acsami.9b06761,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068162459&doi=10.1021%2facsami.9b06761&partnerID=40&md5=b305a0ebb3a12a0b7f2b55ea7fc50896,"American Society for Engineering Education and U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, District of Columbia, 20375, United States; U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Materials Science and Technology Division, Washington, District of Columbia, 20375, United States","Liddell, H.P.H., American Society for Engineering Education and U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, District of Columbia, 20375, United States; Merrill, M.H., U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Materials Science and Technology Division, Washington, District of Columbia, 20375, United States",dry particle adhesion; in situ optical microscopy; particle collection; particle motion; particles at interfaces; surface texture; swipe sampling; trace detection,Adhesion; Explosives; Explosives detection; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Textures; Toxic materials; Trace analysis; Van der Waals forces; Visualization; Weaving; Particle adhesion; Particle collection; Particle motions; Surface textures; Swipe sampling; Trace detection; Substrates,"Liddell, H.P.H.; American Society for Engineering Education and U.S. Naval Research LaboratoryUnited States; email: heather.liddell.ctr@nrl.navy.mil",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

When used in conjunction with ambient-pressure negative-ion helium-plasma ionization (HePI), 1,4-benzoquinone readily captures an electron, forming an abundant molecular anion (m/z 108), which upon exposure to vapors of RDX and HMX generates adduct ions of m/z 330 and 404, respectively. The signal level recorded for RDX upon adduction to the radical anion of 1,4-benzoquinone under our experimental conditions was significantly higher than that realized by chloride adduction using dichloromethane (DCM) as the dopant.

2-s2.0-85064313266,"The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes that could be useful predictors of better detection performance in drugs and explosives detection dogs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected canine olfactory receptor genes responsible for olfactory acuity (OR1P2-like, OR51H5-like, OR52N9-like,OR52P3-like, OR9S13-like), and genes related to the serotoninergic (SLC6A4-like, HTR1A, HTR2B-like)and dopaminergic (SLC6A3-like, DRD1-like, DRD2-like)neurotransmission with a documented role in operant conditioning, were analysed. From a total of 91 certified drug and 57 explosives detection dogs, 10 individuals demonstrating the best and 10 with the poorest detection performance, as evaluated by detection speed and style of searching, were chosen for genetic studies. In this work for the first time we show that not only polymorphisms in selected canine olfactory receptor genes, but also polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter protein for dopamine uptake or the 5-HT2B receptor, are important for canine olfactory detection. The G allele at the OR52N9-like:c.176 A > G and OR52N9-like:c.288 T > G loci had a negative, whereas the A allele at the OR9S13-like:c.592 G > A locus had a positive, effect on the dogs' detection performance measured as mean search time and mean search style. Additionally, the presence of the C allele in the SLC6A3-like:c.181 G > C locus and the A allele in HTR2B-like:c.596 G > A locus was associated with reduced detection performance. We suggest that good candidate dogs for detection training could be chosen for military and civilian service based on favourable genotypes in the olfactory and monoamine neurotransmitter receptor genes.

However, characterization of their interfacial micro-structures remains challenging, due to the sensitive nature of the explosive material, and the extremely thin nature of the interface. This work demonstrates a concept of characterizing interfacial structures between explosives and binders by gas permeation. The N2 permeability data of composite films of cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) particles dispersed in fluororubber binder (copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and chlorotrifluoro-ethylene, F2311) were tested and fitted by using gas transport mechanism theory, e. g. the Hashemifard-Ismail-Matsuura (HIM) model, and the Knudsen diffusion equation. The results indicate the presence of voids of thickness 2.2 nm between HMX and F2311, consistent with the results of neutron reflection and thermal conductivity measurements. These interfacial voids are considered to be related to the surface roughness of HMX particles. This work provides an alternative characterization technique for, as well as a new insight into, the interface between HMX and F2311. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85068898034,"An increase in temperature of an explosive will lead shock sensitivity to change, which affects explosive safety. Therefore, a study of the effect of temperature on the shock initiation of explosives is of great significance. We carried out a series of tests on explosive-driven flyer-initiating heated RDX-based aluminized explosives (61 wt % RDX, 30 wt % Al, 9 wt % binder) and the temperature and input shock pressure of the explosives were controlled accurately during the tests. The pressure histories at different depths inside the explosives were measured by using manganin pressure gauges, and the effect of temperature on detonation wave growth was analysed. The ignition and growth reaction model, some parameters of which rely on temperature, was used to simulate the shock-initiation processes. The relationship between the model parameters and the temperature were obtained from the experimental results. The run distance to detonation as a function of the initial input pressure in a temperature range, the Pop plot, and the reaction degree of the explosives were determined. For the RDX-based aluminized explosives, binder softening and the increasing sensitivity of RDX are the two main reasons that change the shock sensitivity. For 25 °C–110 °C, the shock sensitivity decreases with an increase in temperature, mainly because of binder softening. However, for 110 °C–170 °C, the shock sensitivity increases with an increase in temperature, which depends on the increasing sensitivity of the RDX. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85125981263,"Environmental contamination by explosives like TNT, RDX, and HMX, due to their manufacturing, testing, and disposal, is becoming a matter of immense interest, worldwide. Most explosives are extremely hazardous to biological systems because of their toxicity and mutagenicity. Degradation of such contaminants by naturally occurring plants is often a slow and incomplete process, which leads to accrual of toxicants that can be later introduced into the food web. Therefore bioremediation of contaminated sites through transgenic plants has recently been highlighted. Trans-genesis leads to the overexpression of selected degradative genes/enzymes, namely, nitroreductase and cytochrome P450, of microorganisms, which could enhance not only the plant tolerance but also uptake and degradation performances. This raised the interest of researchers to combine the impressive biodegradative unique capabilities of bacteria with the high biomass and stability of plants, to derive an optimal system for in situ bioremediation of explosives and cleaning up contaminated sites. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Ultrasound produces similar effects and has been proposed as a tool to study the thermomechanical interactions related to explosive initiation. Detailed observations of the processes governing the generation of heat in these materials are severely lacking, yet they are vital for identifying salient physics, improving the modeling tools used to predict mechanical response, improving explosives safety, and providing insight into the initiation mechanisms of explosion. Here we report on high-speed, high-resolution in-situ observations, obtained via synchrotron X-ray phase contrast imaging and diffraction, of the heating and decomposition of an explosive material under ultrasonic excitation.

This approach was used to generate mass spectra for 83 plastic explosives and polymer samples in less than 2 min per sample. To manually interpret and identify all of the constituent polymers and other interesting features in the acquired mass spectra is a tedious and time-consuming challenge. Instead, a methodology based on the systematic calculation of Kendrick mass defects (KMDs) was developed and implemented. Its application allowed the identification of the polymeric support present in each energetic formulation. The presence of polyisobutylene in PG2 has been confirmed thanks to this approach, and a mixture of polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, and polystyrene has been confirmed in the Semtex 10 formulation. The developed methodology has also permitted the observation of changes that occur to the polymeric composition of these formulations after a blast. It appears that the most adequate way to describe post blast polymer samples is that they are less oxygenated and, above all, more unsaturated than the original starting material.

2-s2.0-85065881280,"Triacetone triperoxide is one of the most common used explosives by terrorist and criminal groups, being easily synthesized with over the counter reagents. Moreover, it's difficult to detect since it contains no nitrogen. Extreme resolution mass spectrometry, based on Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry provides a way to established its composition, being able to detect its presence in complex matrixes. In this work, we investigated the detailed chemical composition of triacetone triperoxide and analysed latent fingerprints for evidence of its handling. Our results allowed the characterization of the oligoperoxides formed in the synthesis of triacetone triperoxide: oligomers dihydroperoxy terminated [H(OOC(CH3)2)nOOH] and the oligomeric acetone carbonyl oxides terminated as hydroperoxides [H(O2C(CH3)2)nOOC(O)CH3]. The discrimination between the different synthetic routes using different acid catalysts is possible given the clear differences between the mass spectrum corresponding to each case. Moreover, we identified triacetone triperoxide in latent fingerprints following its manipulation. For criminal investigation, in addition to the unambiguous detection and identification of the explosive, it is of the highest interest to identify the reagents used, who produced it and who used it for criminal purposes. © 2019","Almeida Assis A.C., Caetano J., Florêncio M.H., Cordeiro C.",45661074100;57208823980;6701856949;35917877800;,Triacetone triperoxide characterization by FT-ICR mass spectrometry: Uncovering multiple forensic evidence,2019,Forensic Science International,301,,,37,45,NA,5,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.04.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065881280&doi=10.1016%2fj.forsciint.2019.04.020&partnerID=40&md5=9793236f93e81ea88e3be2d77cf7d731,"Laboratório de FT-ICR e Espectrometria de Massa Estrutural, Centro de Química e Bioquímica, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal; Laboratório de Polícia Científica da Polícia Judiciária, Portugal; EOD|CBRN Unit/Police Special Unit – Polícia de Segurança Pública, Portugal","Almeida Assis, A.C., Laboratório de FT-ICR e Espectrometria de Massa Estrutural, Centro de Química e Bioquímica, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal, Laboratório de Polícia Científica da Polícia Judiciária, Portugal; Caetano, J., EOD|CBRN Unit/Police Special Unit – Polícia de Segurança Pública, Portugal; Florêncio, M.H., Laboratório de FT-ICR e Espectrometria de Massa Estrutural, Centro de Química e Bioquímica, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal; Cordeiro, C., Laboratório de FT-ICR e Espectrometria de Massa Estrutural, Centro de Química e Bioquímica, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal",Explosives; Fingerprints; FT-ICR-MS; TATP,acetone carbonyl oxide derivative; explosive; hydrochloric acid; hydroperoxide derivative; oligomer; oligoperoxide derivative; oxide; peroxide; sulfuric acid; triacetone triperoxide; unclassified drug; accuracy; Article; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical composition; controlled study; finger dermatoglyphics; forensic science; fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; human; materials handling; priority journal,"Cordeiro, C.; Laboratório de FT-ICR e Espectrometria de Massa Estrutural, Portugal; email: caac@fc.ul.pt",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

2-s2.0-85071461981,"In this work, a model for the characterization of unsteady combustion of AP/HTPB composite propellants is benchmarked against experimental data. The model describes a change of phase of the propellant from condensed to gas phase and afterwards its combustion by a simplified chemistry scheme. A Finite Volume approximation is used to solve the system of equations. Firstly, the conservation equations including all source terms but combustion source terms are solved, in this case the numerical fluxes are computed by using Rusanov numerical scheme. Diffusive source terms are solved explicitly. After this, a first order Euler scheme is used to solve the system of ordinary differential equations resulting after considering the combustion source terms. The code is validated with two tests: the burning of a strand composed by AP and HTPB in sandwich configuration and the burning of a strand composed by AP particles uniformly distributed within HTPB. In both cases, simulation results are compared with experimental data. Influence of the pressure in burning rate, AP mass fraction, temperature and gas velocity are examined for sandwich test. For the strand, the effect of the pressure and initial temperature is also analyzed. Results show a good agreement between experimental and numerical data. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With all the advantages of the conventional UVN LIBS, the UVN + LWIR LIBS spectrometer can rapidly and unambiguously reveal both the elemental composition and molecular makeups of the sample that is meters away without any sample preparation required and without the need to unscramble the spectral fingerprints of targets from the irregular and cluttered background. UVN + LWIR LIBS is able to provide in-situ, real-time/near-real-time chemical detection and identification regardless of the shapes and conditions of the sample surface while requiring no need for any sample preparations.

Moreover, bees can be trained to actively search for a smell of explosive. Using trained honeybees in conjunction with a system for honeybee localization enables generation of a spatial-time honeybee density map, where the most visited places point to suspicious areas. In both methods (passive and active), bees’ activity monitoring plays a significant role, providing information about environmental parameters and activities of bees at the entrance and exit of a beehive. In this paper we present the design and realization of an electronic system for bee activity monitoring at the front of a hive while using bees for explosive detection. The system also monitors air temperature and relative humidity.

2-s2.0-85074102581,"In the present work, we studied the influence of the bath composition (e.g., organic modifiers) on the mobility resolving power, resolution, and lifetime of familiar explosives during trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS). Experimental results showed the dependence of the mobility with the organic modifiers (mass and size) for the case of TIMS-MS. Different from trends observed in drift tube like IMS devices, no correlation between the mobility resolving power and resolution in TIMS was observed with the bath gas composition (e.g., air, air + methanol, air +2-propanol, and air + acetone). Time decay plots showed that common explosives with adduct complexes signal decrease over time as a function of the trapping time, without any significant improvement with the addition of the organic modifiers. Theoretical calculation of potential clustering and dissociation pathways supported the time decay findings since no major energetic differences between the pathways were observed as a function of the organic modifiers. Our findings suggest that beside the size of the collision partner, there are specific intermolecular dynamics that drive the trapping behavior of familiar explosives. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","McKenzie-Coe A., Fernandez-Lima F.",56747984700;21734397400;,Influence of gas modifiers on the TIMS analysis of familiar explosives,2019,International Journal for Ion Mobility Spectrometry,22,2,,71,76,NA,1,10.1007/s12127-019-00246-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074102581&doi=10.1007%2fs12127-019-00246-y&partnerID=40&md5=0a155976f929d6a39d254c740738cacb,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL  33199, United States; Biomolecular Sciences Institute, Florida International University, Miami, FL  33199, United States","McKenzie-Coe, A., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL  33199, United States; Fernandez-Lima, F., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL  33199, United States, Biomolecular Sciences Institute, Florida International University, Miami, FL  33199, United States",Common explosives; Organic modifiers; Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry,Acetone; Decay (organic); Explosives; Ion mobility spectrometers; Ions; Mass spectrometry; Thermal insulating materials; Trapped ions; Bath compositions; Dissociation pathways; Energetic differences; Intermolecular dynamics; Organic modifier; Theoretical calculations; Trapped ion; Trapping time; Mass spectrometers,"Fernandez-Lima, F.; Biomolecular Sciences Institute, United States; email: fernandf@fiu.edu",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85067663456,"Emulsion explosives (EE) are one of a typical industrial explosive that is widely used in engineering and mining applications due to its high detonation performance and ideal safety characteristics. However, since an EE is a multicomponent mixture with an oil-in-water structure, the presence of some substances or impurities can reduce the safety of the EE and cause accidents. We investigated the influence of ferrous ion on the thermal behavior and stability of EE during production and storage. The thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry and water solubility method were selected for the assessment of thermal behavior and stability of the EE. According to kinetic parameters, the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the EE and the EE with ferrous ion additives was determined. The results indicated that ferrous ion could decrease the thermal decomposition temperature and Ea of EE. Moreover, the degree of crystallization of ammonium nitrate increases as storage time and ferrous ion content increases. It is of important significance to reduce the hazards of the EE and to improve both safety and stability during production and storage. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Xie X.-H., Feng Y.-Q., Liu S.-H., Zhu J.",8654223600;57201704225;36632804200;57198764109;,Thermal behavior and stability of emulsion explosives in the presence of ferrous ion,2020,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,139,2,,999,1006,NA,7,10.1007/s10973-019-08494-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067663456&doi=10.1007%2fs10973-019-08494-0&partnerID=40&md5=ca547ac18f610489f5a441b6dd2f232d,"School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui  232001, China","Xie, X.-H., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui  232001, China; Feng, Y.-Q., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui  232001, China; Liu, S.-H., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui  232001, China; Zhu, J., School of Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui  232001, China",Ammonium nitrate; Emulsion explosive; Ferrous ion; Thermal decomposition,Accident prevention; Activation energy; Additives; Decomposition; Detonation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Emulsification; Nitrates; Pyrolysis; Stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Thermolysis; Ammonium nitrate; Apparent activation energy; Degree of crystallization; Detonation performance; Emulsion explosives; Ferrous ion; Multicomponent mixture; Thermal decomposition temperature; Ions,"Xie, X.-H.; School of Chemical Engineering, China; email: xxh1963@163.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives

Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used for sample analysis. © 2019","Harries M.E., Bruno T.J.",56079456700;7007182536;,Field demonstration of portable vapor sampling in a simulated cargo container,2019,Forensic Chemistry,16,,100182,,,NA,5,10.1016/j.forc.2019.100182,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072278404&doi=10.1016%2fj.forc.2019.100182&partnerID=40&md5=beddb8464783741f97a4fa2d4eb30bc4,"Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder, 2000 Colorado Avenue, Boulder, CO, United States; National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO, United States","Harries, M.E., Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder, 2000 Colorado Avenue, Boulder, CO, United States; Bruno, T.J., National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO, United States",GC–MS; Portable instrumentation; Trace detection; Vapor analysis,,"Harries, M.E.; Department of Physics, 2000 Colorado Avenue, United States; email: megan.harries@colorado.edu",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
2-s2.0-85061251659,"Image interpretation is an important aspect in the field of forensic science; however, it is seldom reported how to use these techniques in explosion scene forensic investigations. On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions killed 165 people and injured hundreds more at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin. In this study, we applied image interpretation methods to determine the seat of the explosion by analyzing low-quality video clips of the event. The interpretation fits well with recently published standard operating procedures, including the hypothesis, evaluation, inference, and confirmation. Image processing was adopted to enhance the images while the explosion scene was reconstructed with the same images. Some important features were extracted and utilized to distinguish whether the flashes were caused by reflection or a real blast. We reveal the real explosion location, which guides the overall investigation. The results indicate that image interpretation is a powerful tool for forensic investigators to analyze low-quality images in complicated explosions or fire accidents. © 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","Li Z., Sun Y., Xu L., Zhang N., Liu J., Wang H., Zhao Q.",55707181700;36128964100;57104005300;57198822569;57196294029;57205725510;57205722204;,Explosion Scene Forensic Image Interpretation,2019,Journal of Forensic Sciences,64,4,,1221,1229,NA,4,10.1111/1556-4029.13996,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061251659&doi=10.1111%2f1556-4029.13996&partnerID=40&md5=f979e8e6775f5f1d95a15a569741b938,"Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China; Criminal Investigation Bureau, Ministry of Public Security, No. 14, Dong Changan Street, Beijing, 100741, China","Li, Z., Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China, National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China; Sun, Y., Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China, National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China; Xu, L., Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China, National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China; Zhang, N., Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China, National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China; Liu, J., Criminal Investigation Bureau, Ministry of Public Security, No. 14, Dong Changan Street, Beijing, 100741, China; Wang, H., Criminal Investigation Bureau, Ministry of Public Security, No. 14, Dong Changan Street, Beijing, 100741, China; Zhao, Q., Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100038, China, National Engineering Laboratory for Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, Beijing, 100741, China",blast seat; explosion scene; forensic image interpretation; forensic science; image analysis; image comparison,"case report; explosion; forensic science; human; image processing; occupational accident; procedures; videorecording; Accidents, Occupational; Explosions; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Video Recording","Li, Z.; Institute of Forensic Science, No. 17, Muxidi Nanli, China; email: lzhuil@sina.com",Article,Final,,Scopus,NA,INTERPOL 2023,Explosives,Explosives
