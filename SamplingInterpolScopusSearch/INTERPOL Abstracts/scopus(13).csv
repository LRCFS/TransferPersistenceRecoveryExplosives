The experiments are conducted in a direct impact configuration, where a polycarbonate projectile is directly shot onto polymer bonded sugar samples at different impact velocities. During the deformation process, the images are captured at five million frames/second using an ultrahigh speed camera. For the macro scale experiment, the images are captured at a resolution of 75 μm/pixel and for the mesoscale experiments, the magnification factor is 10 μm/pixel. The deformation field is obtained using digital image correlation technique. From the macroscale displacement field, the spatial stress distribution is calculated using a nonparametric method. The meso-scale experiments are used to explain the deformation mechanisms observed at the macroscale. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2019.","2-s2.0-85061261873"

The research was carried out to determine the pressure and macroscopic temperature variation occurring in the specimen by using a pressure sensor and a thermocouple. High-speed photography was used to reveal the macroscopic ignition phenomena. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the material composition of raw and recovered specimens. The results of the experiments described here clearly show that specimens underwent crush, melt and ignition from impact to reaction. At the same time, the relative content of aluminium decreased. Compared to the direct impact results from split Hopkinson compression-shear bar tests, the drop-weight loading pulse is longer, so PBX specimens ignite more easily. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Hotspots occur due to several dissipation mechanisms, including viscoplasticity, viscoelasticity, and internal friction along crack surfaces. To analyze the contributions of these mechanisms, we quantify the ignition probability, energy dissipation, damage evolution, and hotspot characteristics of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) with various levels of constituent plasticity of the energetic phase and internal crack face friction. Using PBX9501 consisting of HMX (Octahydro-1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,2,3,5-Tetrazocine) and Estane as a reference material, we analyze variants of this material with several values of the yield stress of the energetic phase and coefficients of internal crack face friction, while other parameters are kept unchanged. The impact loading involves piston velocities between 200 and 1200 m/s. The analysis uses a Lagrangian cohesive finite element framework that explicitly accounts for finite-strain elastic-viscoplastic deformation of the grains, viscoelastic deformation of the binder, arbitrary crack initiation and propagation in the grains and the binder, debonding between the grains and the binder, contact between internal surfaces, friction and frictional heating along internal surfaces, heat generation resulting from inelastic bulk deformation, and heat conduction. To determine the ignition status of the material or “go” or “no-go” state, we use a criterion based on a criticality threshold obtained from chemical kinetics calculations. For PBX with various levels of HMX plasticity and friction, the probability of ignition, the evolution of dissipation caused by plasticity and friction, the density of cracks, and the locations of cracks are quantified. Results show that samples with higher levels of constituent plasticity (lower yield strengths) or lower levels of internal friction are less likely to ignite. The relative importance of plasticity and friction depends on load intensity, with frictional heating decreasing as load intensity increases. Although the overall viscoplastic heating outweighs the overall frictional heating, friction plays a very important role in hotspot development at all load intensities analyzed, owing to the fact that frictional heating is more localized than viscoplastic heating. The predicted thresholds and ignition probabilities are expressed in a load intensity-load duration relation for PBX with different constituent properties. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85058169273"

A sluggish structural transformation is identified, which started at ∼2.4 GPa and completed at ∼10.6 GPa. The crystal structure of high pressure (phase II) is refined to possess a symmetry of P2. The structural transformation is indicated by the obvious changes in XRD patterns, Raman spectra, and discontinuities of peak positions. Variations in lattice constants and volume of unit cell of the ambient structure (phase I) up to ∼10.0 GPa are also presented. The compressibility of phase I is anisotropic. The compression ratio of b axis is larger than that of a and c axes. The bulk modulus of phase I is B0 = 24.5(4) GPa, and its first pressure derivative is B0′ = 4.5(2). The phase transition is reversible, as the XRD pattern transformed to the initial profile upon release of pressure. On the basis of the Raman and XRD analysis, the high-pressure-induced phase transition of ammonium perchlorate is proposed to be associated with rearrangement of hydrogen-bonded networks. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85049353508"

The combination with different anions (e.g., perchlorate, nitrate, sulfate, and chloride) yields materials with widely varying physicochemical properties. The obtained coordination compounds were characterized using low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction (except 14), IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and DTA (except 16). The sensitivities toward external stimuli (impact and friction) were determined according to the Bundesamt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM) standard methods together with its sensitivities against electrostatic discharge (except 16).

No significant correlation between the oxidation properties of the n-Me powders and the combustion properties of propellants was discovered. An addition of nanopowders caused an increase in the propellant burning rate by approximately 30 % for n-Al, n-B, n-Ni, and n-Mo independent from the pressure values. An addition of n-Cu resulted in a burning rate increase by a factor of 4.9 due to coppers’ probable catalytic activity during interaction with nitroesters and cyclic nitramines in a solid phase. n-Zn additive increased the propellant burning rate by factors 2.3 and 3.6 at 4 and 10 MPa, respectively, due to catalytic activity of zinc in a gaseous phase. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A new method for the synthesis of HMX from 3,7-dipropionyl-1,3,5,7-tetraazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (DPPT) was investigated. Two important intermediates, 1,5-dipropionyl-3-nitroso-7-nitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (DPNNO) and 1,5-dipropionyl-3,7-dinitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (DPDN), were isolated from the reaction mixture. The reaction mechanism, involving a nitrolysis-nitrosolysis-nitrolysis-nitrolysis process, was proposed and verified by the 1H-NMR tracking. Based on the reaction mechanism, a stepwise method to prepare HMX from DPPT was developed. DPPT could be efficiently and smoothly converted to DPNNO in red fuming nitric acid with excellent yield up to 94.2 %. The influence factors on the yields of HMX such as reaction temperature, loading amounts of N2O5 were investigated.

The pulses were produced by the impact of thin plastic flyer plates, which were accelerated by electrically exploded metal foils. Nano-TATB powders with a mean particle size of 60 nm were prepared and pressed into cylindrical sample charges with three densities (1.56, 1.64 and 1.74 g/cm                             3                             ). The flyer impact velocity data versus charging voltages was measured with different flyer thicknesses. Together with the Hugoniot relationships of flyer and samples, the impact pressures and pulse durations were calculated. By using Langlie method, the threshold pressures for shock initiation were determined. In case of the identical flyer plate, the threshold pressure increases with increasing density. In case of the identical explosive density, the threshold pressure increases as the thickness of the flyer decreases (i. e. the pulse duration decreases) except for the highest tested density. These data are represented well by a constant P                             2                             τ initiation criterion for the short, high-pressure pulses and deviate from the P                             2                             τ behavior at lower pressures.

Analysis of the results reveals that an exothermic reaction is detectable at temperatures as low as 500 K. The reaction is found to progress in at least three – and probably four – steps that correlate well with similar findings from the study of nanocomposites of the same composition. The first two steps are shown to be associated with the crackle's delay phase. The transition to the explosive phase is shown to occur at a temperature significantly above the melting point of aluminum, being triggered at or beyond the temperature of operation of the third reaction step.

However, the inherent mechanisms of such stabilization effects are still not well-known. Herein, various transition metal complexes of triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN) using GO as a dopant have been prepared and evaluated. It has been shown that the presence of GO could great improve the thermal stability of the resulted TAG-based complexes. The physical models governing their thermolysis for their initial rate-limiting decomposition steps are obtained using the state-of-the-art evaluation methods. These physical models are further supported by analyses of the overall gaseous products. In addition, the reaction pathways are proposed to explain the stabilization mechanisms of GO. For instance, by interaction of GO, the release of N2 from TAG-Ni was greatly postponed. There is a broad secondary peak at temperature of 378 °C due to decomposition of the nickel nitrides, as the primary thermolysis intermediates of TAG-Ni. The formation of cobalt nitrides plays a significant role on decomposition of TAG-Co and G-T-Co, which results in much less heat release and mass loss in comparison to TAG-Ni. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85060440980"

So far only limited attempts have been made to scale up the production to tens or maximally a few hunderds of grams. This paper provides a review of these small scale production methods as well as characterization techniques for nanometric explosives and oxidizers. As a result of the limited scale-up, the application of energetic nanomaterials in typical propellant and explosive formulations is currently very limited. This might be caused by the fact that a clear and commonly shared view on which energetic nanomaterials and production processes it would be economically beneficial and feasible to invest in is lacking at the moment. Furthermore, a considerable number of technical challenges can be expected regarding the processing of energetic nanomaterials on a composition level. To manage these challenges, this review proposes several technical solutions which may contribute to a better understanding of the benefits, risks and costs involved in the use and scale-up of energetic nanomaterials and, if considered economically feasible, a more widespread application of these nanomaterials in the defense and space domains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85048729581"

We have observed dramatically increased handling sensitivity of ETN in the molten state, using temperature controlled drop-weight impact sensitivity measurements. Impact testing was performed using ERL Type 12 drop hammer equipment using a 2.5 kg weight, a 0.8 kg striker, an anvil and sound detection equipment. Most experiments were performed in the absence of standard grit paper, due to the elevated temperature measurements with a liquid. At room temperature, ETN exhibited an impact sensitivity of 14.7 ± 3.4 cm, which changed to 1.0 ± 0.6 cm in the liquid state at 65 °C. The change in sensitivity in the liquid state was found to be reversible upon solidification, and did not appear to correlate with temperature. Control experiments were performed in the same setup using standard explosives pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP). This is the most sensitive material that we have been able to measure using our instrumentation, and indicates that ETN be handled with extreme caution during the melt-casting process. © 2019 The Authors","2-s2.0-85059819983"

This behavior was studied by non-isothermal TG and DSC techniques and the decomposition kinetics were determined by the isoconversional methods named Kissinger and modified Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS). For comparison, the traditional TNT casted compositions based on 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) named composition B and β-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (β-HMX) were studied. Also Vacuum Stability Test (VST) was used isothermally at 120 °C for six hours to determine the specific rate constants. Despite of the volatility of TNT, the obtained results showed that the reactivity of the studied cyclic nitramines in mixtures was increased in the order HMX < BCHMX < RDX, because of their incorporation into the melted TNT (acidic solvent). The kinetic compensation effect and outputs of the Vacuum Stability Test clearly exemplify this reactivity. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the recently published facts about this composition and its application in practice, the mixture is a promising composition which has high relative explosive strength compared with the other studied compositions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85048827709"

Nitrocellulose is known to chemically degrade with age, but the corresponding effect on explosive performance is currently unknown. Two new cylinder tests were fielded with the oldest known PBX 9404 explosive (>46 years) and the data was compared with prior PBX 9404 cylinder test data. A method for comparing wall motion data collected by streak camera and laser interferometry diagnostics was also introduced. Analysis of the cylinder motion indicated that the aged explosive exhibits decreased performance, which varied with cylinder expansion radius and product specific volume. This energy decrement was found to be 0.8% of the total initial explosive energy per decade of age at a product volume of 7.0 cc/g. The measured energy decrement in explosives older than 37 years exceeds the chemical energy content of nitrocellulose, indicating that nitrocellulose decomposition radicals are likely degrading the normally stable HMX molecules during the aging process. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-85052849663"

Such sensitivities could be controlled by adjusting the surface area or (in)organic additives; however, increased stability leads to a decrease in the explosives' performance. Here, high-energy-density molecules hosted in inverse opal-like porous carbon (IOC) nanocomposites demonstrate the mechanical stabilization and desensitization of RDX and HMX inside the carbon nanostructure using host-guest chemistry techniques. For this strategy, the uniform, vacant voids of the IOC were used to provide internal crystallization for the impact/frictional stabilization of explosives, and also to enhance the thermal reactivity by the high heat conductivity of IOC initiating detonation by thermally induced hotspot. The weight percentage of high explosives hosted by recrystallization at high temperatures and in vacuum reached ∼70%. After high explosives were embedded inside the IOC, the impact, friction and electrostatic stability was greatly increased (2-2.15-fold, 1.86-1.92-fold, and 1.25-2-fold, respectively) compared with free RDX and HMX. Also, addition of PVP as a binder controlled the effectiveness and efficiency of the carbon template, enabling control of the impact and friction sensitivity from 14.72 J to >79.43 J and from 295.81 to 352.80 N, respectively. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85058529056"

By analyzing the structural changes, IR spectra, and the Hirshfeld surfaces, we investigated the high-pressure behavior of 3,6-dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT) to provide detailed description of hydrogen bonding interactions using dispersion-corrected density functional theory. The strengthening of hydrogen bonding is observed by the pressure-induced weakening of covalent N-H bonds, which is consistent with the red shift of NH/NH2 stretching vibrational modes. The intermolecular interactions in DHT crystals lead to more compact and stable structures that can increase the density but diminish the heat of detonation, Q. The calculated detonation properties of DHT (D = 7.62 km/s, P = 25.19 GPa) are slightly smaller than those of a similar explosive 3,6-bis-nitroguanyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (D = 7.9 km/s, P = 27.36 GPa).

To expand the forensic strategy, elemental analysis of the plastic caps which are present in these items was performed. Both x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis was performed to explore the possibilities for differentiation. The inherent inhomogeneity of the plastics resulted in high variations, especially for LA-ICP-MS trace analysis. In addition, due to the lack of suitable reference materials the LA-ICP-MS results can only be used for qualitative comparisons. Although XRF is less sensitive it allows for semi-quantitative analysis and the effect of inhomogeneity is significantly reduced due to the larger sample areas. Therefore, XRF is the method of choice for elemental analysis of intact plastic caps. In this scenario initial differentiation based on visual examination is combined with elemental analysis to obtain the highest degree of discrimination. In post-explosive scenarios, using XRF is not as straightforward due the irregular shapes of the burned plastic cap residues and contamination by explosive residues. For the analysis of these post-explosive caps, LA-ICP-MS proved to be useful for characterization and differentiation. Overall, it was found that blue caps contain a considerable higher amount of elements than the white caps, mainly due to additives related to the coloring process. This limits differentiation for the flash bangers containing white caps. Therefore, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis was performed to increase the differentiation potential. Based on carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios additional sets could be distinguished, both for flash bangers containing white and blue caps, that otherwise have similar visual and elemental characteristics. With the elemental and isotopic analysis of the plastic caps, an analysis strategy has been introduced that is not based on the pyrotechnic charge and therefore provides a unique opportunity to perform characterization and differentiation of flash bangers in pre- and post-explosive casework. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85050120435"

These surfaces containing explosive particles were imaged using a reflex camera before and after the particles were transferred. Afterwards the images were processed in MATLAB where pixels corresponding to explosive residues were quantified. Results demonstrated that transfer of explosive residues frequently occurred with certain differences among materials. Generally, the amount of explosive particles adhered to the finger decreased in the following order: skin>latex>nitrile, while the transfer of particles from the finger to another surface was the opposite.

Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the obtained NaIO4-encapsulated nanoAl released a heat of 1415.7 J g−1, which is more than that of Al/CuO (1069 J g−1) nanothermite. The burning rate of the NaIO4-encapsulated nanoAl nanothermite was found to be almost six times higher than that of Al/CuO. At the same time, the new nanothermite system also demonstrated a high pressurization rate of 2.94 GPa s−1 with a transient peak pressure of 5.66 MPa, as well as a rapid release of gases which was nearly three times higher than that of Al/CuO and two times higher than that of Al/NaIO4 (by physical mixing) and Al/Fe2O3 nanothermite. More importantly, the NaIO4-encapsulated nanoAl obtained by spray drying exhibits lower activity energy compared to Al/NaIO4 prepared by physically mixing method due to the higher degree of intermixing between fuel and oxidizer.

Overpressure sensors, an infrared thermal imager, and a high-velocity photography system were used to compare the explosive fireball temperature, scattering movement, and post-combustion characteristics of composite charges with different non-detonative materials. The fireball temperature distributions of the active non-detonative materials (rubber containing various proportions of aluminum powder) were not uniform, and the heat radiation power, heat flux, and overpressure were relatively high and first decreased and then increased with increasing aluminum powder content. The active non-detonative materials had two high-temperature regions in the lateral direction. Oxygen-free explosions, anaerobic combustion, and post-combustion processes occurred during the energy-release reaction of the composite charges. The temporal evolution of the throwing radius of the explosion products of the composite charges was investigated, and the rate of scattering of the non-detonative materials was analyzed. The rate of scattering was higher than that of an inert non-detonative material (polyurethane) and first increased and then decreased with increasing aluminum powder content. Based on the explosion-proof performance and heat radiation energy output characteristics, rubber containing 50 % aluminum was selected as the optimal non-detonative material. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Design/methodology/approach: Following a short introduction, this first considers remote gas detection using the DIAL technique. Remote gas cloud imaging is then discussed, and this is followed by a review of chemical warfare agent detection technologies. A selection of research activities and product developments aimed at remotely detecting explosives are considered and, finally, brief concluding comments are drawn. Findings: Remote gas sensing is now a practical reality, and products are available which can remotely detect, identify, quantify and in some cases visualise a wide range of toxic and environmentally threatening gases. These satisfy numerous industrial, environmental and military applications. Remotely detecting explosives poses a significant technological challenge, and despite some commercialisation, it remains the topic of an extensive research effort, much involving LIBS and Raman techniques. Importantly, much of this work also has potential in non-military applications, with several developments being shown to detect various industrially important compounds. Originality/value: This provides a technical insight into the techniques and products used in a range of remote chemical sensing applications. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85044927604"

Fillers of these PBXs are nitramines 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and β-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5-tetrazocane (β-HMX), cis-1,3,4,6-tetranitro-octahydroimidazo-[4,5-d]imidazole (bicyclo-HMX, BCHMX) and ε-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (ε-HNIW, CL-20) which are bonded by polyfluoro-elastomers, polydimethyl-siloxane, poly-glycidyl azide, polyisobutylene, polystyrene-butadiene, poly-acrylonitrile-butadiene and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene in addition to a melt cast compositions based on 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. For thirty two of these PBXs the relationships are specified and analyzed between heats of their combustion and relative explosive strengths; by means of these relationships it might be possible to estimate, which groupings in the macromolecule of binder could be liable to their primary fission in the PBXs initiation. Similarly, for forty two of these explosives, the relationships are described and analyzed between their enthalpies of formation and impact sensitivities; here is especially attention paid to PBXs filled by BCHMX. Specific rate constants from Vacuum Stability Test (VST) of four nitramines and twenty PBXs are introduced into relationships with their enthalpies of formation. Regarding to all the mentioned cases, increasing of energy content of the studied explosives leads to increase of the relative explosive strength or initiation reactivity, respectively. Exception with the opposite trend, the outputs of VST are for BCHMX, where in PBXs are matrices with the esteric plasticizers or the energetic poly-glycidyl azide. Admixture of RDX or HMX, respectively, into the BCHX PBXs gives ternary PBXs whose thermal stability, in the sense of applied VST, is higher comparing to the original binary explosives. © 2018 The Authors","2-s2.0-85059354510"

The change in temperature and humidity will result in PBXs cracks formation and cause higher risk of explosion evolution when undergoing various stimulus including impact or friction. Herein, a self-healing polymer binder is developed to solve this problem. The fluoropolymer gel binder, a PVDF-co-HFP (copolymer of CH2-CF2 and CF2-CF(CF3))/EMIOTf (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate)/graphene ternary composite, has high density, high thermal conductivity, excellent interfacial adhesion property, and exhibits self-healing ability at room temperature. Highly filled PBXs composites with 95% of explosive 2, 6-diamino-3, 5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) and 5% of ternary composite are fabricated. The as-prepared PBX samples have high denotation parameter (7800 m s−1), low impact sensitivities (11–12 J), and low friction sensitivity (no sparks was observed even at friction energy load of 0.36 N). More importantly, our PBXs have effective crack healing ability within 48 h at room temperature. Therefore, the stability and safety of PBXs are improved through the self-healing polymer binder. Such PBXs can find widespread application in various military and civil fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85052140774"

It was shown that the burning rate of the DB propellants can be significantly enhanced by both the nanocomposite catalysts, with reduced pressure exponent. In particular, the Cu2O−PbO/GO induced a burn rate enhancement for DB propellant in pressure range of 2–14 MPa, with the maximum catalytic efficiency of 3.87 at 2 MPa. More interestingly, it resulted in “mesa” burning of DB propellant in the pressure range of 12–20 MPa (n=-0.05). The CuO−Bi2O3/GO have the same effect with a burning rate increasing from 2.15 to 8.57 mm s−1 at 2 MPa. Similarly, for the RDX-CMDB propellant, the GO-based composites of Cu2O−PbO/GO and CuO−Bi2O3/GO showed evident catalytic activities. Plateau combustion was achieved in their presence, which is of great importance for practical applications.

Imaging was performed employing a reflex camera in a purpose-built photo studio.

The amount of explosive residues transferred in each fingerprint was determined as the number of pixels containing explosive particles. First, the pattern of PETN transfer by ten different persons in successive fingerprints was studied. No significant differences in the pattern of transfer of PETN between subjects were observed, which was also confirmed by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Then, the transfer of traces of the nine above explosives in ten consecutive fingerprints to cotton fabric and polycarbonate plastic was investigated.

By use of ultrasound to induce intense, localized frictional heating at the surface of crystals embedded in a flexible polymer, we have created a new method for the initiation of microexplosions under conditions where temporal and spatially resolved observations can be made. Specifically, we report the use of ultrasound to flash-heat polymer-embedded <500 μm RDX (CH2NNO2)3 and HMX (CH2NNO2)4 crystals at rates >10000 K/s. By using this extremely rapid heating on small samples, we were able to confine the explosion to narrow regions in time and space. The explosion was measured using dual thermal imagers providing temporal and spatial resolutions of 1 μs and 15 μm. Surprisingly, the explosions always occurred in two stages, an initial 0.1 ms stage and a subsequent 100 ms stage. The first stage of RDX explosion (2500 K lasting 140 μs) was less violent than that for HMX (4400 K lasting 70 μs), which is consistent with the general observation that HMX is regarded as a higher-performance explosive. The origin of the two-stage explosion originates from how the explosive chemistry is modulated by the mechanical behavior of the flexible polymer at the interface with the explosive crystal. The crystal explosion created a blast that produced a cavity in the surrounding polymer filled with reactive gases; subsequent ignition of the gases in that cavity caused the second-stage explosion. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85048373730"

The confirmation, reproducibility, and characterization of energetic materials are still a widely debated topic especially when the material of interest has exceptional properties. In this work, CL-20/TATB co-crystals are attempted via solvent-nonsolvent (S/NS) cocrystallization to assess the formation of a true co-crystal. The prepared crystals were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that AIH replaces the Al2O3 passivation layer on Al particles that limits Al oxidation. The new core-shell particle reactivity was characterized using laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) and results for two different Al-AIH core-shell samples that vary in the AIH concentration demonstrate their potential use for explosive enhancement on both fast (detonation velocity) and slow (blast effects) timescales. Estimates of the detonation velocity for TNT-AIH composites suggest an enhancement of up to 30% may be achievable over pure TNT detonation velocities. Replacement of Al2O3 with AIH allows Al to react on similar timescales as detonation waves. The AIH mixtures tested here have relatively low concentrations of AIH (15 wt. % and 6 wt. %) compared to previously reported samples (57.8 wt. %) and still increase TNT performance by up to 30%.

The binding energy, trigger bond length distribution, interaction energy of trigger bond, cohesive energy density, detonation parameters and mechanical properties were calculated and compared. The influences of adulteration crystal defect on comprehensive properties of CL-20/TNT cocrystal explosive were explored and estimated. The results show that compared with primitive model, binding energies of defective models are decreased by 0.91–14.67%, i.e., the intermolecular interaction energy is decreased and stability is weakened. The maximum trigger bond length is increased by 0.33–4.36%, while the interaction energy of trigger bond is decreased by 1.33–12.27% and cohesive energy density is decreased by 0.45–11.24%, indicating that sensitivity is increased and safety is decreased.

DAAF has been evaluated as a possible replacement for RDX in TNT-based, aluminized as well as nonaluminized melt cast formulation. DAAF-based melt cast formulations were characterized for their sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, bomb calorimetric analysis, and thermal decomposition behavior. The thermal analysis reveals the compatibility of DAAF with benchmark explosives like RDX and TNT in explosive formulations. The composition DT (DAAF + TNT) and DTA (DAAF + TNT+ Al) is more friction and impact insensitive as compared to RT (RDX + TNT) and RTA (RDX + TNT+ Al) compositions. The bomb calorimetric values of DT composition as well as DTA composition are higher than RT and RTA compositions.

This concept builds from recent explosive experiments where the minimum spot size for single-point initiation in PBX 9502 was determined. Below this threshold, PBX 9502 could not be initiated. This was then expanded to three initiation points, which were smaller than this threshold. Measurements of the velocity and pressure of the wave interactions were collected using Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV). Not only was initiation observed, but the resulting pressures at the double and triple points were found to be above the CJ state for PBX 9502.

In particular, this work studies the effect of trap re-use on collection efficiency of organic explosives, namely 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), and correlates this data to quantifiable morphology changes. Collection efficiency was measured by liquid extraction of the traps with detection and quantitation by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using silhouette microscopy for visualization of the trap texture, morphology changes were quantified by several measurements of trap roughness and hairiness, drawing from techniques and metrics used in the textiles industry. Nomex traps were visibly roughened by repeated re-use, and this was correlated with significant improvements in trap collection efficiency (11–57%) depending upon the specific analyte and substrate combination interrogated.

One of the advantages of βCDs is the ability to tune their properties by chemical modification. Here, we synthesised nitrated cross-linked βCDs (βNCXCDs) to produce new binders for energetic formulations. The cross-linking of βCD with non-toxic triethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (TEGDGE, X=T) and poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ethers (PEGDGE, X=P) yielded soft, water soluble oligomeric compounds (βCXCDs) which can improve the processability of energetic formulations and contribute to their desensitisation. When the PEGDGE cross-linker was used, lower glass transition temperatures were achieved, which extended the operative range of the βCPCD binder to −20 °C. The analogous nitrated systems (βNCXCDs) were therefore synthesised using a 1 : 1 (v/v) ratio of 98 % sulfuric acid/100 % nitric acid or 100 % fuming nitric acid, increasing their solubility in acetone and tetrahydrofuran. The nitrated derivatives were characterised by decomposition temperatures (200 °C) and energies (up to 1750 J g−1) comparable to nitrocellulose. Moreover, the glass transition of the inert βCXCDs at low temperatures (<0 °C) was conserved in the corresponding nitrated βNCXCDs, ensuring the desensitisation of energetic compositions even at low temperatures. This is the first time that nitrated derivatives of βCD with glass transition temperatures below 0 °C have been reported, suggesting such derivatives could make suitable replacements for nitrocellulose and other binders in energetic formulations. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effects of cocrystallization and molar ratios on stabilities, sensitivity, energetic performance and mechanical properties of cocrystal explosives were evaluated.

The ASE method development was benchmarked against Soxhlet extraction with a view to improving extraction efficiency in terms of time and solvent volume. Key parameters for the ASE method development involved selecting the most appropriate solvent, optimising static time, ensuring a safe oven temperature for explosives, determination of a sufficient number of rinse cycles and effective sample preparation. To achieve optimal extraction, cutting the PBX samples to maximise solvent exposure was essential. The use of acetone with a static time of 10 minutes at 100 °C with three rinse cycles achieved 97 %±10 % extraction of RDX from PBX in 40 minutes using 72 mL solvent. Extraction time was reduced from 48 hours and solvent use by half compared to the standard Soxhlet extraction. To validate the developed ASE method, two other PBX samples containing different quantities of explosive were also fully extracted using the same parameters. Overall, ASE efficiency was comparable to Soxhlet, which places the ASE as a good alternative and shows potential for implementation as a standard method for other polymer based explosives. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A calculation method for the dynamic response of concrete and energy output of RDX-based aluminized explosive is proposed based on the time-dependent Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state (JWL-EOS), cavity expansion model and energy partition theory, which is in turn verified through experiments with 70 g RDX/Al/wax (65 %/30 %/5 %) charge embedded in concrete. Based on the proposed method, the dynamic response of concrete and energy output of RDX/Al/wax with four different aluminum reaction rates were calculated. The results indicate a positive correlation between the crushed region radius and the aluminum reaction rate, and that the cracked region radius is inversely proportional to the aluminum reaction rate. For the energy output of RDX/Al/wax, the shock wave energy grows with increasing aluminum reaction rate, while the detonation products expansion energy increases and then drops with rising aluminum reaction rate, peaking at 2.37 MJ/kg when the Al reaction rate constant M=0.02.

Detonation failure, here defined as a weakly supported shock wave traveling with a decaying velocity, of aluminized ammonium nitrate (AN/Al) was considered to investigate the relationship between the detonation failure process and shock sensitivity. Previous work has shown that the Al additive particle size alters the failure diameter, a measure of shock sensitivity, of AN/Al. Microwave interferometry was used to measure the transient shock wave velocity in the explosive system, which was lightly confined at a diameter below its critical diameter, in response to an overdriven shock insult in a small-scale experiment. An array of mixture ratios and particle size distributions of the explosive system was used to vary the sensitivity of the explosive and to facilitate exploration of the relationship between the shock velocity decay rate, initiation mechanisms, and large-scale shock sensitivity. Resulting shock velocity profiles in AN/Al indicate that micron-sized and larger Al particles can contribute to the detonation process. It is concluded that the rate at which the transient shock velocity approaches that of a compressive wave with no supporting reaction corresponds to the relative shock sensitivity of the system; it is therefore proposed that the measured shock velocity decay rate of an overdriven sub-critical diameter charge of AN/Al reveals quantifiable information about the relative shock sensitivity of a large-scale charge. © 2018 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85047365878"

This study is devoted to evaluate the impact of such energetic additives on thermal behavior, chemical stability, and shelf life. Extruded MDB formulations were manufactured by extrusion process. Artificial aging at 80 °C for 28 days was conducted. Shelf life assessment was performed using Van't Hoff's equation. Quantification of evolved NOx gases with aging time was performed using quantitative stability tests. MDB formulation based on HMX demonstrated extended service life of 16 years compared with (AP/Al)-MDB which demonstrated 9 years. This finding was ascribed to the reactivity of AP with nitroglycerin with the formation of perchloric acid. Thermal behavior of aged MDB, exhibited an increase in heat released with time; this was ascribed to the auto-catalytic thermal degradation during artificial aging. The increase in released heat by 31% was found to be equivalent to evolved NOx gases of 6.2 cm3/5 g and 2.5 cm3/1 g for Bergmann-Junk test, and Vacuum stability test respectively.

This review focuses on three aspects namely screening techniques, extraction techniques, and instrumental techniques. For the screening techniques, this review focuses on fast detection based on chemical respond for pre-and post-explosion residues. Different types of extraction methods including swabbing technique, solid phase extraction, and solid phase microextraction were discussed. Instrumental techniques covered in this review included gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. © 2017, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences.

The suitability of materials to retain explosives residues and their subsequent analysis has been scarcely investigated. Particularly, the use of explosive mixtures containing inorganic oxidizing salts to make improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is a current security concern due to their wide availability and lax control. In this work, a wide variety of materials such as glass, steel, plywood, plastic bag, brick, cardboard or cotton subjected to open-air explosions were examined using confocal Raman microscopy, aiming to detect the inorganic oxidizing salts contained in explosives as black powder, chloratite, dynamite, ammonium nitrate fuel oil and ammonal. Post-blast residues were detected through microscopic examination of materials surfaces. In general, the more homogeneous and smoother the surface was, the less difficulties and better results in terms of identification were obtained. However, those highly irregular surfaces were the most unsuitable collectors for the posterior identification of explosive traces by Raman microscopy. The findings, difficulties and some recommendations related to the identification of post-blast particles in the different materials studied are thoroughly discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85015646985"

The decomposition time of RDX and AP in the IMX was confirmed by TG–FTIR–MS. Regardless of the SiO2/AP ratio, the decomposition heat of the IMX reached maximum when the mass ratio of SiO2/RDX was around 0.1. When the SiO2/RDX mass ratio was kept at 0.1, the decomposition heat of the IMX firstly increased and then decreased with rising AP content. The kinetic parameters of three different IMXs were measured. It was found that in the IMX, RDX and AP decomposed at the same time, and the oxygen released from AP allowed the RDX to decompose more thoroughly in the redox reaction. According to TG–FTIR–MS, the IMX had superior thermal performance than the physical mixture of RDX and AP.

This metal is very reactive and is characterized by high heat of combustion. Aluminum is widely used in various technical fields such as: space technology, production of common use items, cars, airplanes, high energy materials. Aluminum in the shape of flakes or granulated with different particle size (nano-and micro-) is used in different mixtures. Aluminum powder is used as a component in rocket propellants, pyrotechnics, primary or secondary explosives. Aluminum as one of the components of solid rocket propellants acts as metallic fuel and the particle size of aluminum influences the utility properties of products. The particle size and aluminum content affect the viscosity of a rocket propellant mixture, burning time, ignition temperature, ignition delay time and specific impulse. This paper discusses the influence of modifications of the external layer of aluminum on the properties of aluminum combustion in rocket propellant. Aluminum acts as a fuel in pyrotechnic mixtures. The size of aluminum particles can affect parameters such as decomposition temperature and ignition temperature in pyrotechnic mixtures. One type of pyrotechnic mixtures consists of thermites. Introducing nano-sized aluminum to thermites creates mixtures with new properties called superthermites, nano-thermites or metastable intermolecular composites (MICs). Nano-thermites can possess different combustion characteristics than standard thermites.

Using cryofocusing conditions, precision of 8–53 %RSD was achieved for headspace extraction for the majority of the compounds with recoveries of as much as 37% and low breakthrough. Furthermore, the headspace calibration curves show a linearity of 0.951 or better for the target compounds, suggesting the quantitation capabilities of the CMV device.

In the first thermal reaction, the energetic material was converted to furoxane compounds, and then, these furoxane compounds were decomposed by the second thermal reaction. Activation energies and Arrhenius pre-exponential factors of thermal responses were determined by using isothermal (Coats–Redfern) and nonisothermal/isoconvertional (Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall) methods with thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. With these calculated values, other thermodynamic parameters reaction enthalpy, entropy changes and free energy were calculated. Formation enthalpies of the elements of the energetic substances were theoretically calculated using the CBS-4M algorithm in the Gaussian 09 program for the synthesized energetic substances. In the thermal decomposition reactions, the products were estimated with the aid of literature data and the enthalpies of explosion reactions were theoretically calculated according to the Hess Law. Besides, the exothermic energies in the first and second thermal reactions of the energetic substances were measured by DSC.

In order to move towards this goal, ideally experimental studies should be performed on systems with small, systematic structural modifications, with modeling utilized to interpret experimental results. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a common nitrate ester explosive that has been widely studied due to its use in military and commercial explosives. We have synthesized PETN derivatives with modified sensitivity characteristics by substituting one -CCH2ONO2 moiety with other substituents, including -CH, -CNH2, -CNH3X, -CCH3, and -PO. We relate the handling sensitivity properties of each PETN derivative to its structural properties, and discuss the potential roles of thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity and heat of formation, thermal stability, crystal structure, compressibility, and inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding on impact sensitivity. Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the C/H/N/O-based PETN-derivatives have been performed under cook-off conditions that mimic those accessed in impact tests. These simulations infer how changes in chemistry affect the subsequent decomposition pathways. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","2-s2.0-85045729111"

Inhomogeneities have been registered by electro-optical camera NANOGATE 4BP allowing to make 4 frames with the exposure time 10 ns. According to experimental results the detonation front in nitromethane-acetone mixture is unstable. It is evident that pulsations on detonation front do not form spatial periodic structure and their dimensions differ several times. But mean longitudinal size of pulsation is about 500 μm at 20 wt% of acetone concentration. This means that the typical size of cell equals to reaction zone width. The same structure of cellular front have been registered in 70/30 FEFO-methanol mixture. Second kind of instability, failure waves, was observed in neat nitromethane at the free surface. In this case the stability loss result in turbulent flow which is clearly detected in the shots obtained. Adding small amount of DETA (0.5 wt%) results in disappearance of the failure waves and flow stabilization. The effect is caused by the fact that DETA sharply accelerates initial rate of chemical reaction because it is sensitizer for nitromethane. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-85043709947"

This article studied the thermal properties transformed from thermal decomposition to thermal explosion for a less violent nitrocellulose sample (nitrogen content: 10.92%). Four experiments were implemented: XPS analysis and SEM analysis, DSC-TG analysis, and small-scale thermal explosion experiment. From XPS analysis and SEM analysis, high temperatures led to the decrease of N1s and O1s (O-NO2 bond) and the break or even “melt” of the nitrocellulose fibers. The results demonstrated that nitrocellulose would become more unstable if it was exposed to high temperature. From the DSC-TG analysis and small-scale thermal explosion experiment, the upper critical ambient temperatures (UCATs) of the nitrocellulose were calculated. The UCATs of the nitrocellulose sample would decrease from 132.5ºC to 96.4ºC with the dimensions increased from 0.1 m to 1.6 m. The results demonstrated that the risk of spontaneous combustion and thermal explosion increased significantly with the increase of the volume of nitrocellulose. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-85037747915"

This work studies the evolution of these volatile organic compounds over time and across a number of variables including synthesis method, precursors, storage time, and storage environment. The composition and quantity of these volatiles were compared across these variables. Analysis of the headspace of bulk HMTD was carried out using solid phase microextraction (SPME) with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

However, at the time of the airbag inflation, the gas generators release toxic combustion gases such as CO, NH3, and NOx. In this study, we investigated the combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of GN/BCN mixture, focusing primarily on their exhaust gas composition. As a result, when the exhaust gas of the combustion under constant pressure in an inert gas stream was analyzed using a detection tube, the amount of NOx (mainly NO) yielded greater decrease with increasing atmospheric pressure as compared to the amounts of CO and NH3. Thus, provided GN/BCN is ignited in a closed container, a large amount of NOx is presumed to have been released during the initial stage of combustion, which yielded comparatively low pressure. Results of the thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG/DSC/FTIR) indicated that the GN/BCN mixture caused endothermic decomposition at 170 °C and exothermic decomposition at 208 °C, which was accompanied by 66% mass loss. The decomposition gases, CO2, N2O, and H2O, were detected via FTIR spectrum. Because N2O was not detected in the combustion gas, it was suggested that the detected N2O was generated at a low temperature and decomposed in high-temperature combustion. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85030863384"

Two sampling methods of rolling (with a metal roller) and handrubbing were used, and stainless steel mesh was used as the smear matrix for collection of explosive material. Testing parts of the TLB and BP were selected in consideration of contaminant accumulation, physical contact, and sample collection. Explosive materials deposited on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheet were transferred to the testing part, the explosive materials existing on the testing part were collected using the smear matrix, and then the collected explosive materials were analyzed using IMS. High signal-to-noise ratio over 10 was applied for the determination of the minimum initial explosive concentration (Cmin_PTFE) to detect in IMS. The handrubbing method was much more efficient than the rolling method. The Cmin_PTFE values were different according to the testing parts. The Cmin_PTFE values of the TLB were higher than those of the BP. The experimental results were explained by difference in surface morphology of the testing areas.

Given their large interior surface area and chemical versatility, archetype metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are selected for preconcentration of explosives and their precursors occurring in low concentrations, and are compared to the state-of-the-art sorbent Tenax TA. Applying inverse gas chromatography (iGC), this study shows that several archetype MOFs, namely HKUST-1 and MIL-53, surpass Tenax regarding their specific retention volume for nitromethane, a typical ingredient in improvised explosives. Using linear hydrocarbons as reference probe molecules, the dispersive surface energy is determined for all MOFs along with the specific contribution of the nitro group for HKUST-1 and ZIF-8. Trends from pulse-chromatographic iGC-investigations are mostly followed in breakthrough and thermal desorption experiments using a 1000 ppm nitromethane source. In these experiments, HKUST-1 proves the peak substance, with enrichment factors being 109-fold higher than for Tenax, followed by MIL-53. In case of HKUST-1, this factor is successfully reproduced for a 1 ppm concentration scenario.

While each of these application categories is very distinct in terms of the analytical challenges posed, there are a number of common themes than can be identified from an examination of the relevant literature appearing over the review period. The traditional atomic spectrometry techniques (e.g. AAS, OES, XRF, ICP-MS) are relatively mature, but reports continue to appear that seek to address perceived limitations in sensitivity in certain applications, but increasingly more frequently in relation to sample handling and preparation/extraction methodologies, validation and creation of SRMs and methods. However, it is equally clear that because of that very maturity such techniques are more often cited as analytical reference methods to support the development of other approaches (e.g. GD-OES, GD-MS, PIXE, PIGE, RBS, SEM-EDS, SIMS, TXRF, micro- and macro-XRF, XAS, XPS) that provide either direct sampling or depth and lateral elemental profiling capabilities. Consequently, a variety of techniques may now be routinely applied within an individual study to characterise samples to the extent it is hard to comment critically on the particular analytical novelty that lies at the heart of the work. It is fair to say that in some cases, the significance of the research now involves revealing the features of the sample (including examining surface modifications, coatings, thin films and multilayers, or even the characteristics of a device, functional component, or object, or complex mixture) rather than in the development of the analytical approach itself. That said, certain trends in technique development still expand the range of applications that can be addressed. For example, interest in LIBS continues to command attention and is heavily cited in most application sections of this review. The technique offers certain unique advantage for elemental analysis in rapid direct sampling, portability and operating in remote and harsh environments (including industrial production) where low level detection is not essential. Clearly sensitivity remains the Achilles' heel for LIBS but developments in measurement technique such as pulse delay are resulting in better optimised procedures. The development in laser solid sampling technology is providing benefits applicable to other techniques such as ICP-MS and newer variants such as laser ionisation MS. Indeed, lasers, flames, plasmas and other electrical discharges have been used regularly in the fabrication of samples. The atomic spectrometry techniques with which they have been associated are now employed to study such production processes in situ. The development of nanomaterials has given rise to new approaches to particle size distribution and single particle characterisation where the atomic spectrometric determination produces a size rather than a concentration. There is evidence too in the review of research work going on to understand the environmental consequences of the widespread use of new technologies using data analysis approaches to examine source, provenance or impact. Consequently, while the fundamental analytical questions: ""What?"" and ""How much?"" continue to be relevant to researchers increasingly these must now be qualified in many situations by providing answers to enquiries such as ""Where?"" and ""How big (or small)?"". © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.","2-s2.0-84993969583"

However, they suffer from sintering and incomplete combustion, leading to poor reactivity and low energy utilization efficiency. In order to enhance the energy output and combustion performance of nanothermites, ammonium perchlorate (AP) was introduced into the Al/CuO nanothermites. The nanothermites with varied content of AP were prepared by electrospray. The morphological characterization of the nanothermites confirms that the nanoparticles are homogeneously mixed without agglomeration. Heat release, specific impulse, and peak pressure of gaseous products exhibit remarkable enhancement with increasing AP content. Specifically, the nanothermites with 7.5 wt % AP produce specific impulse and heat energy of ∼2.7 and ∼1.4 times higher than those of Al/CuO-based nanothermites without AP. In addition, the ignition delay time of the nanothermites containing AP is not greatly increased, enabling fast response during practical applications. Thermal analysis implies that the thermite reaction between Al and CuO can be divided into two steps in the presence of AP: solid-solid phase and liquid-solid phase diffusion reaction. These results provide facile strategy to enhance the output performance of nanothermites, which may facilitate the practical propulsion and combustion applications of nanothermites. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85046467208"

The preferred analytical method worldwide is the ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) that is capable of detecting most explosives at the nano-gram level. Sample collection for the IMS analysis is based on swabbing of a passenger's belongings to collect possible explosive residues. The present study examines a wide range of issues related to swab-based particle collection and analysis, in the hope of gaining deeper understanding into this technique that will serve to improve the detection process. The adhesion of explosive particles to three typical materials, plastic, metal and glass, were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that a strong contribution of capillary forces to adhesion on glass and metal surfaces renders these substrates more promising materials upon which to find and collect explosive residues. The adhesion of explosives to different swipe materials was also examined. Here we found that Muslin, Nomex® and polyamide membrane surfaces are the most promising materials for use as swipes. Subsequently, the efficiency of multiple swipe use – for collecting explosive residues from a glass surface using Muslin, Nomex® and Teflon™ swipes – was examined. The study suggests that swipes used in about 5–10 “sampling and analysis cycles” have higher efficiency as compared to new unused swipes. The reason for this behavior was found to be related to the increased roughness of the swipe surface following a few swab measurements. Lastly, GC-MS analysis was employed to examine the nature of contaminants collected by the three types of swipe. The relative amounts of different contaminants are reported. The existence and interference of these contaminants have to be considered in relation to the detection efficiency of the various explosives by the IMS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85020049042"

Cocrystallization has been explored as another route to development of novel materials. However, very little characterization of detonation performance has been performed for these energetic cocrystals. A major challenge for performing detonation velocity measurements with cocrystals is that typical measurement techniques require hundreds of grams to kilograms of material, an amount that exceeds the entire supply of many cocrystals. In this work, small-scale detonation velocity measurements using about 1.2 g of material per test employing microwave interferometry are presented and discussed for a novel cocrystal of 1-methyl-3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole (MDNT) and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and compared to a physical mixture of MDNT and CL-20 in the same molar ratio. The results are compared with detonation velocity measurements with cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), which provide validation of the technique and further comparison of the results. With this technique, detonation velocity differences as low as 100 m/s are resolvable. The MDNT/CL-20 cocrystal is observed to detonate over 500 m/s faster than the physical mix and over 600 m/s faster than HMX at the same charge density which is held constant in this work. The enthalpy of formation of the MDNT/CL-20 cocrystal was also measured. Using this, the detonation velocity of the cocrystal was calculated using thermochemistry to be 230 m/s faster than that of the physical mixture of MDNT and CL-20 in the same molar ratio as is contained within the cocrystal at a charge density of 1.4 g/cm3. The higher detonation velocity of the cocrystal (both measured and predicted) compared to the physical mixture is likely attributable to bonding energy contained within the cocrystal and the arrangement of the coformers within the cocrystal. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The formation of the co-crystal was tested by scanning electron microscope (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Based on the elemental analysis and the enthalpy of combustion obtained by the calorimetric bomb, the enthalpy of formation was calculated to be 196.9 kJ·mol–1. Sensitivity to impact was measured and 50 % probability of initiation was 9.7 J for the co-crystal. In addition, the detonation characteristics were predicted by EXPLO5 Code. The detonation velocity (D) and the detonation pres-sure (P) of the co-crystal are 8254.5 m·s–1 and 26.7 GPa, respectively.

Much research has been carried out to aid in the vapor detection of traditional explosives, such as the nitro-based explosives like trinitrotoluene (TNT) and black and smokeless powders. Many of these explosives have extremely low vapor pressures, thus related vaporous components of the vapor signature are used for detection by proxy. As most of these explosives are extremely stable, their vapor signatures do not change significantly with time or environment. In contrast, comparatively little research has been done on the vapor detection of homemade explosives (HMEs), whose unique chemistries make vapor signature analysis a more complex problem. In this work, the vapor signatures of two types of HMEs were explored across time and environmental conditions, including ammonium nitrate-based binary explosives and organic peroxide explosive. © 2017 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85027164645"

The analytical procedure employed consisted of the sampling stage, extraction from gauze swab, transfer of the extract and execution of an instrumental analysis based on gas chromatography with electron capture detector (ECD).

These explosives engender environmental concerns, due to atmospheric pollution caused by emission of dust and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from blasts, the latter characterised by the average emission factor of 5 kg (t AN explosive)−1. This first-of-its-kind review provides a concise literature account of the formation of NOx during blasting of AN-based explosives, employed in surface operations. We estimate the total NOx emission rate from AN-based explosives as 0.05 Tg (i.e., 5 × 104 t) N per annum, compared to the total global annual anthropogenic NOx emissions of 41.3 × 106 t N y−1. Although minor in the global sense, the large localised plumes from blasting exhibit high NOx concentration (500 ppm) exceeding up to 3000 times the international standards. This emission has profound consequences at mining sites and for adjacent atmospheric environment, necessitating expensive management of exclusion zones. The review describes different types of AN energetic materials for civilian applications, and summarises the essential properties and terminologies pertaining to their use. Furthermore, we recapitulate the mechanisms that lead to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species in blasting of AN-based explosives, review their implications to atmospheric air pollution, and compare the mechanisms with those experienced in other thermal and combustion operations. We also examine the mitigation approaches, including guidelines and operational-control measures. The review discusses the abatement technologies such as the formulation of new explosive mixtures, comprising secondary fuels, spin traps and other additives, in light of their effectiveness and efficiency.

Forensic chemists have been spearheaded to develop information-rich confirmatory technologies and techniques and apply them to a broad array of forensic challenges. The purpose of these confirmatory techniques is to provide alternatives to presumptive techniques that rely on data such as color changes, pattern matching, or retention time alone, which are prone to more false positives. To this end, the application of separation techniques in conjunction with mass spectrometry has played an important role in the analysis of forensic evidence. Moreover, in the past few years the role of liquid separation techniques, such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry, has gained significant tractions and have been applied to a wide range of chemicals, from small molecules such as drugs and explosives, to large molecules such as proteins. For example, proteomics and peptidomics have been used for identification of humans, organs, and bodily fluids. A wide range of HPLC techniques including reversed phase, hydrophilic interaction, mixed-mode, supercritical fluid, multidimensional chromatography, and nanoLC, as well as several modes of capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry, including capillary zone electrophoresis, partial filling, full filling, and micellar electrokenetic chromatography have been applied to the analysis drugs, explosives, and questioned documents.

For active sampling, air flows from an external source, through the device, carrying the mixed analyte odor towards the instrument of choice. For passive sampling, component odor diffuses from the bulk material through a Teflon neck, where odors mix before exiting the device at a bowl-shaped outlet.

A wide variety of explosives or explosive-related compounds were evaluated, including nitramines, nitrate esters, nitroaromatics, and a nitroalkane. Fortified soil samples were extracted with acetone, processed via solid phase extraction (SPE), and then analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The following three SPE sorbents in cartridge format were compared: Empore™ SDB-XC, Oasis® HLB, and Bond Elut NEXUS cartridges. The NEXUS cartridges provided the best overall recoveries for the 12 explosives in potting soil (average 48%) and the fastest processing times (<30 min). It also rejected matrix components from spent motor oil on potting soil. The SPE method was validated by assessing limit of detection (LOD), processed sample stability, and interferences. All 12 compounds were detectable at 0.02 μg explosive/gram of soil or lower in the three matrices tested (potting soil, sand, and loam) over three days. Seven explosives were stable up to seven days at 2 μg/g and three were stable at 0.2 μg/g, both in processed loam, which was the most challenging matrix. In the interference study, five interferences above the determined LOD for soil were detected in matrices collected across the United States and in purchased all-purpose sand, potting soil, and loam. This represented a 3.2% false positive rate for the 13 matrices processed by the screening method for interferences. The reported SPE cleanup method provides a fast and simple extraction process for separating organic explosives from matrix components, facilitating sample throughput and reducing instrument maintenance. In addition, a comparison study of the validated SPE method versus conventional syringe filtration was completed and highlighted the benefits of sample cleanup for removing matrix interferences, while also providing lower supply cost, order of magnitude lower LODs for most explosives, higher percent recoveries for complex matrices, and fewer instrument maintenance issues. © 2017","2-s2.0-85041570711"

Moreover, the thermal decomposition mechanisms of nano CL-20 and nano PETN were investigated using thermal-infrared spectrometry online (DSC-IR) analysis, by which their gas products were also detected.

CAN is also frequently used to make homemade explosives. The potential of using elemental profiling and chemometrics to match both pristine and reprocessed CAN fertilizers to their factories of origin for use in future forensic investigations was examined. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentrations of 64 elements in 125 samples from 11 CAN stocks from 6 different CAN factories. Using Fisher ratio and degree-of-class-separation, the elements Na, V, Mn, Cu, Ga, Sr, Ba and U were selected for classification of the CAN samples into 5 factory groups; one group was two factories from the same fertilizer company. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was used to develop a classification model which was tested on a separate set of samples. The test set included samples that were analyzed at a different time period and samples from factory stocks that were not part of the training set. For pristine CAN samples, i.e., unadulterated prills, 73% of the test samples were matched to their correct factory group with the remaining 27% undetermined using strict classification. The same PLSDA model was used to correctly match all CAN samples that were reprocessed by mixing with powdered sugar. For CAN samples that were reprocessed by mixing with aluminum or by extraction of AN with tap or bottled water, correct classification was observed for one factory group, but source matching was confounded with adulterant interference for two other factories. The elemental signatures of the water-insoluble (calcium carbonate) portions of CAN provided a greater degree of discrimination between factories than the water-soluble portions of CAN. In summary, this work illustrates the strong potential for matching unadulterated CAN fertilizer samples to their manufacturing facility using elemental profiling and chemometrics. The effectiveness of this method for source determination of reprocessed CAN is dependent on how much an adulterant alters the recovered elemental profile of CAN. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85020039731"

For this purpose, two different methods were employed. First, nano-K6 was produced by means of the Spray Flash Evaporation process. Particles with a median size of 74 nm were obtained. Sensitivity to friction and electrostatic discharge were reduced by downscaling particle size of K6. Second, due to their molecular analogy, the mixing of K6 and RDX was studied. For that reason, a physical nanometric mixture of K6 and RDX was produced by the same technique. In the latter case, an inter-particular synergy between both compounds was noticed but without forming a cocrystal. The median particle size of the mixture is about 82 nm, and its sensitivity is between the ones of raw nano-materials concerning friction and electrostatic discharge. Moreover, the mixture is less sensitive to impact (3.03 J) than nano-K6 (<1.56 J) and nano-RDX (threshold is 2.0 J). © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","2-s2.0-84956573794"

These particles provide an evidentiary trail which is useful for security applications, a fact which is enhanced by the fact that many explosives materials of interest have low vapor pressures, augmenting their longevity. The persistence or stability of explosives particles on a substrate is a function of several environmental parameters or particle properties, including vapor pressure, particle size and geometry, airflow, particle field size, substrate topography, humidity, reactivity, adlayers, admixtures, particle areal density, and temperature.

On this basis, much has been said about the possible benefits resulting from the use of molecular and atomic information for the detection of explosives. The orthogonal nature of the spectral and compositional information provided by Raman spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) makes them suitable candidates for an optimal combination of their data, thus achieving inferences that are not feasible using a single sensor. The present manuscript evaluates several architectures for the combination of spectral outputs from these two sensors in order to compare the benefits and drawbacks of data fusion for improving the overall identification performance. From the simple assembling (concatenation or addition) of Raman and LIBS spectra to signals' processing on the basis of linear algebra (either the outer product or the outer sum), different identification patterns of several compounds (explosives, potential confusants and supports) have been built. The efficiency on target differentiation by using each of the architectures has been evaluated by comparing the identification yield obtained for all the inspected targets from correlation and similarity measurements. Additionally, a specific code integrated by several of these patterns to identify each compound has also been evaluated.

To reach the goal of detecting the 500 ppb level, we find the h0 satisfying h0 ≈ hres/10 is enough. The slope of linear part of the velocity shift for the glassy-rubbery and rubbery is greater than that of glassy film. The slope between the glassy-rubbery and rubbery is almost the same in linear part. But plasticization causes the rubbery film to easilier behave as an acoustically thick one than glassy-rubbery and glassy polymer. To keep stable oscillation in vapor sensing, the induced attenuation should be reduced as much as possible and the linear velocity changes are preferable. Therefore, the glassy-rubbery film is suitable for a chemical interface because it promotes higher sensitivity than glassy film, larger linear range than rubbery film and easier to avoid resonance than rubbery film. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

This method already proved itself in mass spectrometry due to the combination of high sensitivity and possibility of investigation of small molecules because of the absence of the influence of a substrate on the ion signal. In this work we present summarized results of our investigations dedicated to the use of the surface assisted laser desorption/ionization on pSi in ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), which is one of the most promising analytical methods in the area of fast detection of low concentrations of organic molecules.

A calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to determine a value of activation energy of desorption and a quantity of explosives desorbed by laser radiation. A special vacuumoptical module was elaborated and integrated into a vacuum mass-spectrometric system to focus the laser beam on a sample. It has been shown that the action of nanosecond laser radiation set at q= 107 - 108 W/cm2, λ=266 nm on adsorbed layers of molecules of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and pentaerytritoltetranitrate (PETN) leads not only to an effective desorption, but also to the non-equilibrium dissociation of molecules with the formation of nitrogen oxide NO. The cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) dissociation products are observed only at high laser intensities (q> 109 W/cm2) thus indicating the thermal nature of dissociation, whereas desorption of RDX is observed even at q> 107 W/cm2 from all substrates. Desorption is not observed for cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX) under single pulse action: the dissociation products NO and NO2 are registered only, whereas irradiation at 10Hz is quite effective for HMX desorption.

Microchip FAIMS (μ-FAIMS) with small dimensions has high electric field up to E/N= 250 Td, making the approximation methods and conclusions for nonlinear relationships inappropriate for these systems.

We then calculated the specific alpha coefficients for cocaine, morphine, HMX, TNT and RDX, respectively, based on their FAIMS spectra measured by μ-FAIMS system at ultra-high fields up to 250 Td. The results show that there is no difference in nonlinear alpha functions obtained by the approximation and new method at low field (<120 Td), but the error induced by using approximation method increases monotonically with the increase in field, and could be as much as 30% at a field of 250 Td.

A piezoelectric inkjet printhead located atop a drying tube produces precise droplets containing defined quantities of analyte. Droplets solidify into microparticles with known composition and size as they traverse down the drying tube. Because this is a drop-on-demand printing process, a known number of droplets are produced providing quantitative particle delivery to a variety of substrates. Particular emphasis is placed on the development and characterization of the drying tube in this work. The drying tube was modeled using computational fluid dynamics and experimentally evaluated using laser-based flow visualization techniques. A notable design feature of the drying tube is the ability to push heated air through the tube rather than the need to pull air from the exit. This provides the ability to place a known number of well-defined particles onto almost any substrate of interest, rather than having to collect particles onto a filter first and then transfer them to another surface. Several types of particles have been produced by this system, examples of which are pure particles of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine ranging from 10 μm to 30 μm in diameter, and ammonium nitrate particles of 40 μm diameter.

However, up to now, the effects of substrate (such as morphology, size, material composition) on the performance of electrochemical sensors have been mainly focused on metal platform, while the investigation about metal oxide substrate has not been reported in detail. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a technologically important semiconducting material with large band gap energy between 3.2 and 3.4 eV at room temperature which has attracted widespread attentions. In previous reports, the nanostructured ZnO was randomly formed on graphene layers. The control of morphology or size of nanostructures is a prerequisite for the nanostructure for fabricating various types of nanocomposites. Here, we used graphene oxide (GNO) as the supporting material for constructing a series of synchronously electrochemically reduced graphene oxide and zinc oxide composites (rGNO-ZnO) with different morphologies for comparing their morphology-dependent electrochemical sensing behaviors. The experimental parameters, such as the electrodeposition potential, time, and concentration of electrolyte, would influence the composite morphology and further bring different electrochemical sensing ability. Among them, rGNO-ZnO with nanowalls morphology (noted GZNWs), obtained from the conditions of 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 electrolyte, -1.0 V electrodeposition potential and 30 min electrodeposition time, presented an optimal ability for DNA detection and 2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) electrocatalysis. The fine nanowall structure may be able to provide more accessible sites, and the synergistic effect between rGNO and ZnO may enlarge the electrochemical activity. The electrochemical DNA sensor based on GZNWs exhibited the steepest slope with the detection range, as well as the highest sensitivity when compared with other electrodeposition potentials. In order to further explore the other electrochemical performances (for instance the electrocatalysis), the GZNWs was used to detect the nitroaromatic compound (such as 2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene, TNT).

While a number of classifiers exhibiting high discriminatory power have been reported, efforts in establishing the subset of relevant spectral features that enable a fundamental interpretation of the segmentation capability and avoid the 'curse of dimensionality' have been lacking. Using LIBS data acquired from a set of secondary explosives, we investigate judicious feature selection approaches and architect two different chemometrics classifiers -based on feature selection through prerequisite knowledge of the sample composition and genetic algorithm, respectively. While the full spectral input results in classification rate of ca.92%, selection of only carbon to hydrogen spectral window results in near identical performance. Importantly, the genetic algorithm-derived classifier shows a statistically significant improvement to ca. 94% accuracy for prospective classification, even though the number of features used is an order of magnitude smaller. Our findings demonstrate the impact of rigorous feature selection in LIBS and also hint at the feasibility of using a discrete filter based detector thereby enabling a cheaper and compact system more amenable to field operations.","2-s2.0-84939857072"

Loss of munitions constituents from the sorbent phase after uptake was observed for the ""pesticide"" POCIS configuration but not for the ""pharmaceutical"" configuration. Therefore, the latter was selected for further investigation. Under constant exposure conditions, TNT, ADNTs, DANT, RDX, and atrazine (a common environmental contaminant) accumulated at a linear rate for at least 14d, with sampling rates between 34mL/d and 215mL/d. When POCIS were exposed to fluctuating concentrations, analyte accumulation values were similar to values found during constant exposure, indicating that the sampler was indeed integrative. In contrast, caffeine (a common polar contaminant) and TNX did not accumulate at a linear rate and had a reduction in accumulation of greater than 50% on the POCIS during fluctuating exposures, demonstrating that POCIS did not sample those chemicals in an integrative manner. Moreover, in a flow-through microcosm containing the explosive formulation Composition B, TNT and RDX were readily measured using POCIS, despite relatively high turnover rates and thus reduced water concentrations. Mean water concentrations estimated from POCIS were±37% of mean water concentrations measured by traditional grab sample collection.

The theoretical queuing network proved an accurate method of predicting cycle time for the system while in steady state but was subject to various assumptions.

Initial materials-based coarse segmentations, generated using the Dual-Energy Index (DEI), are refined by partitioning at automatically detected regions. Partitioning is guided by a novel random forest based quality metric, trained to recognise high-quality, single-object segments. A second novel segmentation quality measure is presented for quantifying the quality of full segmentations based on the random forest metric of the constituent parts and the error in the number of objects segmented. In a comparative evaluation between the proposed approach and three state-of-the-art volumetric segmentation techniques designed for single-energy CT data (two region-growing [1,2] and one graph-based [3]) our method is shown to outperform both region-growing methods in terms of segmentation quality and speed. Although the graph-based approach generates more accurate partitions, it is characterised by high processing times and is significantly outperformed by the proposed method in this regard.

Recently, ultrasonic excitation has been shown to generate heat within plastic-bonded energetic materials. To investigate the impact of crystal morphology on this heating, samples of elastic binder are implanted with single ammonium perchlorate crystals of two distinct shape groups. Contact piezoelectric transducers are then used to excite the samples at ultrasonic frequencies. The thermal responses of the crystals are recorded using infrared thermography, and the rate of heating is estimated. Surface temperature increases up to 15 °C are found to arise after 2 s of excitation, with much higher heating levels expected near the inclusions themselves as demonstrated by the chemical decomposition of some crystals under favorable excitation conditions. The rates of heat generation are compared to various crystal morphology features through 2D estimates of length scale, perimeter and irregularity. It is observed that crystals grown in the lab, featuring sharp geometric facets, exhibit a higher probability of significant heat generation than inclusions with more spherical shapes. However, no statistical link is found between the rates of heat generation and the crystal morphology in those samples that do generate significant heating, likely because variations in surface roughness cannot be entirely eliminated during experimentation.

It encompasses a liquid-xenon (LXe) converter-scintillator coupled to a UV-sensitive gaseous Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM)-based imaging photomultiplier (GPM). In this work we present and discuss the results of a systematic computer-simulation study aiming at optimizing the type and performance of LXe converters. We have evaluated the detector spectral response, detection efficiency and spatial resolution for gamma-rays and neutrons in the energy range of 2-15 MeV for 50 mm thick converters consisting of plain LXe volume and LXefilled capillaries, of Teflon, Polyethylene or hydrogen-containing Teflon (Tefzel). Neutron detection efficiencies for plain LXe, Teflon-capillaries and Tefzel-capillaries converters were about 20% over the entire energy range. In polyethylene capillaries converters the neutron detection efficiency was about 10% at 2 MeV and increased up to about 20% at 14 MeV. Detection efficiencies of gammas in Teflon, Tefzel and polyethylene converters were ∼ 35%. The plain-LXe converter provided the highest gamma-ray detection efficiency, of ∼ 40-50% in the 2-15 MeV energy range. Optimization of LXe-filled Tefzel capillary dimensions resulted in spatial resolution of ∼ 1.5mm (FWHM) for neutrons and up to 3.5mm (FWHM) for gamma-rays. Simulations of radiographic images of various materials using two discrete energy gammarays (4.4 MeV and 15.1 MeV) and neutrons in a broad energy range (2-10 MeV) were performed in order to evaluate the potential of elemental discrimination. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.","2-s2.0-84947261563"

The results are often represented as run distance or time versus input shock pressure on Pop plots. In practice, however, input shocks to explosives are often not 1D. Instead, they may be oblique or non-planar. Here, we present results from a series of experiments in which a PBX 9502 slab was bonded on one side to a PBX 9501 slab. The faster detonation in the PBX 9501 slab drove an oblique shock in the PBX 9502. The result was a two-dimensional (2D) shock structure consisting of a region of delayed reaction, referred to as an initiating layer, immediately adjacent to the PBX 9501/9502 interface, and a transition to detonation further from the interface. The initiating layer thickness varied with the input shock pressure, which was controlled by the thickness of the PBX 9501 layer. The results of seven such tests are presented in run-time versus input-shock-pressure space and compared to Pop plots generated with data from 1D experiments. Good agreement was observed, with the 2D results showing similar run-times to detonation, but more scatter for a given input shock pressure. The good correlation between the 1D and 2D data suggests the transverse component of the initiating shock does not have a significant effect on the initiation physics. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.

In this work we have explored some of the fundamental aspects that influence collection and detection of trace levels of explosive residues from surfaces. We compared the analyte-release performance of standard muslin sampling swipes to that of rationally assembled fiberglass cloth, and used thermal-desorption ion mobility spectroscopy for detection. This collection-detection system is widely used for analyzing the trace chemical residues. The fiberglass cloth was chemically modified by covalently bonding phenyl-functional groups to the surface. The rationally assembled sampling materials provide significantly performance improvements over standard muslin sampling materials for detection of TNT, NG, RDX, TATP, and PETN. The phenyl-functionalized fiberglass swipes showed over 10 times greater TNT release, compared to muslin sampling swipes, as well as improved response and repeatability after multiple uses of the same swipe. The improved TNT release from the functionalized-fiberglass swipes resulted in significantly improved detection limits over muslin. To better understand the improvement offered by the phenyl-functionalized fiberglass, several commercially available fiberglass materials, each offering specific characteristics, were also compared, allowing several physical and chemical properties to be systematically explored to determine their influence on performance.

An understanding of the postblast explosive particle morphology would provide vital information during forensic examinations, allowing rapid initial indication of the explosive material to be microscopically determined prior to any chemical analyses and thereby saving time and resources at the crucial stage of an investigation. In this study, condensed phase particles collected from around the detonations of aluminized ammonium nitrate and RDX-based explosive charges were collected in a novel manner utilizing SEM stubs. By incorporating the use of a focused ion beam during analysis, for the first time it is possible to determine that such particles have characteristic shapes, sizes, and internal structures depending on the explosive and the distance from the detonation at which the particles are recovered. Spheroidal particles (10-210 μm) with microsurface features recovered following inorganic charge detonations were dissimilar to the irregularly shaped particles (5-100 μm) recovered following organic charge firings. Confirmatory analysis to conclude that the particles were indeed explosive included HPLC-MS, Raman spectroscopy, and mega-electron volt-secondary ionization mass spectrometry. These results may impact not only forensic investigations but also the theoretical constructs that govern detonation theory by indicating the potential mechanisms by which these particles survive and how they vary between the different explosive types.

In addition, kinetic binding analysis of the MIP-modified QTF sensor was carried out for the sensors stored and operated under ambient conditions (740 mmHg, 20-23 °C). Although the polymer was able to maintain its physical and chemical properties at microscopic, BET adsorption, and spectroscopic levels, the intrinsic adsorption properties of hydrocarbons onto MIP binding sites altered over time, which suggest that the 3-D conformational changes of the polymer binding sites occurring at nanoscopic/angstrom level may cause the sensitivity degradation in MIP.

Though, TNT has no absorption band at 532 nm (due to higher band gap i.e. 2.7 eV), but its mixture in graphite matrix might reduce the band gap and enable it to absorb 532 nm wavelength due to pi-orbital coupling between graphite and TNT molecules.

The fragment velocity distribution along the circumference of the casing is distinctly non-uniform due to the difference in blast loading around the circumference of the casing. To quantify the fragment velocity distribution, two kinds of cylindrical rings with different structural parameters were adopted. Static explosive experiments with three eccentric coefficients (0, 0.5, 1.0) were conducted with pulsed X-ray diagnostics. Using coefficients derived from experimental data and calculating the effects of both the eccentricity of initiation and angle around the circumference, an angle-dependent ratio βθ of charge mass to casing mass has been derived as a mean to modify the fragment velocity formula of Gurney for this application. The derived formula was shown to correctly predict the fragment velocity distribution around the circumference of the cylindrical ring. The calculated velocity distributions show good agreement with the experimental results. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","2-s2.0-84927581401"

A prototype, Nebulex™, was recently developed in our laboratory. Basically, it couples the solubilization of an analyte from the atmosphere by a nebulization process and in-situ detection. This article presents the development and integration of an electrochemical sensor for the detection of nitromethane, a common chemical product that can be used to make an improvised explosive device. A gold screen-printed electrode was used in a flow-cell and a detection limit of 4.5 μM was achieved by square wave voltammetry. The detection method was also determined to be selective toward nitromethane over a large panel of interfering compounds. Detection tests with the Nebulex™ were thus carried out using a custom-made calibrated nitromethane vapor generator. Detection times of less than one minute were obtained for nitromethane contents of 8 and 90 ppmv. Further measurements were performed in a room-measurement configuration leading to detection times in the range of 1-2 min, clearly demonstrating the system's efficiency under quasi-real conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This work reviews in detail that research focused on the identification of explosives by SERS, including TNT, DNT, RDX, PETN, TATP, HMTD, perchlorate, etc. either in bulk state, in solution or in vapor phase. In brief, TNT and DNT have been widely studied by SERS due to its aromatic structure and LODs down to 5-10 zg and 10-17-10-13 M have been achieved. The other explosives have been quite less researched; therefore, few results are available to be compared and a bit more modest LODs have been reached such as 10-13 M for RDX, 10-4 M for TATP, 5 pg for PETN, or 10-9 M for perchlorate.

By loading of Ag nanotriangles onto the filter paper, a flexible SERS substrate with good activity and reproducibility was obtained and the ultratrace detection of p-aminothiophenol (pATP) with a concentration as low as 10-8 M was achieved.

This material emits strong visible blue photoluminescence (PL) upon UV excitation.

On the other hand, H2O2/fuel mixtures exhibit no sensitivity in ABL testing, but exhibit some sensitivity in BAM testing. For the UNi mixtures, the behavior was the opposite, no sensitivity in BAM but some sensitivity in ABL. KClO4/Al mixtures exhibit high sensitivity in the ABL method, but only moderate sensitivity in the BAM method. Other differences are seen in the relative sensitivities underscoring the differences in the mechanisms of how each test method operates.

Moreover, the enhancement effect was repeatedly renewed by the reconstruction of molecular bridges, which could selectively detect TNT with a lower limit of 4 × 10-14 M.

These functionalized PILs were synthesized via post modification of thermo-chemically and mechanically stable polybenzimidazole (PBI). Formed PILs were evaluated for their ability to detect NACs through quenching of fluorescence intensity. Quenching of fluorescence intensity in solution state for NACs, such as nitrobenzene (NB), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and picric acid (PA), was found to be rapid in both the PILs possessing pyrene and anthracene. The solution-phase Stern-Volmer quenching constants for PA were higher than for other NACs.

These films also exhibited rapid and selective fluorescence quenching when exposed to the saturated vapors of NACs at ambient temperature and pressure. Fluorescence emission of PIL films was affected little by the presence of commonly found interferents. Furthermore, fluorescence intensity could be recovered after the quenching, enabling the reuse of these PIL films for detection of NACs.

However, all previous designs have been based on passively excited surface plasmons, in which sensitivity is intrinsically limited by the low quality factors induced by metal losses. It has recently been proposed theoretically that surface plasmon sensors with active excitation (gain-enhanced) can achieve much higher sensitivities due to the amplification of the surface plasmons. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active plasmon sensor that is free of metal losses and operating deep below the diffraction limit for visible light. Loss compensation leads to an intense and sharp lasing emission that is ultrasensitive to adsorbed molecules. We validated the efficacy of our sensor to detect explosives in air under normal conditions and have achieved a sub-part-per-billion detection limit, the lowest reported to date for plasmonic sensors with 2,4-dinitrotoluene and ammonium nitrate. The selectivity between 2,4-dinitrotoluene, ammonium nitrate and nitrobenzene is on a par with other state-of-the-art explosives detectors. Our results show that monitoring the change of the lasing intensity is a superior method than monitoring the wavelength shift, as is widely used in passive surface plasmon sensors.

Characterization was performed via the mean threshold voltage. The results showed that the mean threshold voltage of exploding foil initiators was reduced by 16% when the foil bridge width was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.3 mm, which means that a reduced foil bridge width could decrease the mean threshold voltage of exploding foil initiators as suggested by theoretical analysis. The mean threshold voltage of exploding foil initiators was reduced by 20% as the flyer thickness was decreased from 50 μm to 25 μm, which could be an efficient way to improve the sensitivity of exploding foil initiators. The flyer accelerated to over 90% maximum velocity after flying 0.15 mm in a fine barrel, which revealed that exceeding a barrel length of 0.15 mm has little effect on the performance of exploding foil initiators. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Combination of multiform reactant ions would provide more information and is in favor of correct identification of explosives. Fast switchable CO3 -(H2O)n and O2-(H 2O)n reactant ions were realized in a dopant-assisted negative photoionization ion mobility spectrometer (DANP-IMS). The switching could be achieved in less than 2 s by simply changing the gas flow direction. Up to 88% of the total reactant ions were CO3-(H 2O)n in the bidirectional mode, and 89% of that were O2-(H2O)n in the unidirectional mode. The characteristics of combination of CO3-(H 2O)n and O2-(H2O) n were demonstrated by the detection of explosives, including 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX), ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO), and black powder (BP). For TNT, RDX, and BP, product ions with different reduced mobility values (K0) were observed with CO3-(H2O)n and O 2-(H2O)n, respectively, which is a benefit for the accurate identification.

The nitrogen-containing organic groups played a key role in sensing nitroaromatic compounds that can bind 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) to form TNT anions through an acid-base pairing interaction and FITC dye conjugation. The formation of TNT anions efficiently quenched the emission of FITC dye at 516 nm by fluorescent resonance energy transfer and induced the enhancement of a resonance light scattering (RLS) signal. A novel, dual-channel chemosensory FITC&PEI probe was thus constructed. Meanwhile, the FITC&PEI probe also exhibited highly selective fluorescence and RLS responses for TNT over other nitroaromatic compounds. Very good linearity was observed within the ranges of 3.0-150 nM TNT (detection limit down to 0.5 nM and RSD of 5.8%, n = 7) for fluorescence and 1.0-150 nM TNT (detection limit down to 0.2 nM and RSD of 8.4%, n = 7) for RLS.

Although ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been proved to be the most effective method for screening organic explosives, it still faces a major challenge to detect inorganic explosives owing to their low volatilities. Herein, we proposed a strategy for detecting trace inorganic explosives by thermal desorption ion mobility spectrometry (TD-IMS) with sample-to-sample analysis time less than 5 s based on in-situ acidification on the sampling swabs. The responses for typical oxidizers in inorganic explosives, such as KNO3, KClO3 and KClO4 were at least enhanced by a factor of 3000 and their limits of detection were found to be subnanogram. The common organic explosives and their mixtures with inorganic oxidizers were detected, indicating that the acidification process did not affect the detection of organic explosives. Moreover, the typical inorganic explosives such as black powders, firecrackers and match head could be sensitively detected as well. These results demonstrated that this method could be easily employed in the current deployed IMS for on-site sensitive detection of either inorganic explosives or organic ones.","2-s2.0-84930673694"

This is the second paper to report the testing data on monolithic tempered glass windows. While the first paper reports the glass panel response and failure modes, the current paper concentrates on the glass fragments induced by the blast loadings. Thermally tempered glass has been often adopted for monolithic windows to reduce ejecting fragment hazards after window fracture. However, previous blast tests conducted on monolithic tempered glass reported that in addition to small cubic fragments the shattered glass panes could break into large and jagged fragments similar to the cases in annealed glass which poses much more debris threats than expected.

The system, known as STARR (Shortwave-infrared Targeted Agile Raman Robot), utilizes shortwave infrared spectroscopy for the identification of potential threats, combined with a visible short-range standoff Raman hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system for material confirmation. The entire system is mounted onto a Talon UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), giving the sensor an increased area search rate and reducing the risk of injury to the operator. The Raman HSI system utilizes a fiber array spectral translator (FAST) for the acquisition of high quality Raman chemical images, allowing for increased sensitivity and improved specificity.

We use the Mie scattering theory which is an exact solution of the scattering problem for spherical particles of arbitrary size. In this paper, we approximate the particles as spheres with an equivalent volume. While we expect particle shape to influence IR spectra (albeit to a lesser extent), in this paper, we restrict ourselves to the effect of size (i.e. particle diameter) only. We also study the effect of air, solvent and other additive inclusions on the IR spectra. Finally, we address the effect of particle surface roughness. We show that all these parameters (size, inclusions, roughness) affect the scattering process which results in distortions to the IR spectra as compared to library values for bulk material. The effect of substrate on the IR spectra is not studied due to the limitations of the Mie scattering theory which was developed for isolated particles only. In addition to particle-related effects on IR spectra, the presence of substrate will have additional effects as well and this was studied previously by other research groups. We expect that the results of this study will help improve the performance of various detection algorithms by accounting for changing IR spectra. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905836715"

Interestingly, all the tbutyl substituted pyrene containing polymers showed higher sensitivity than the corresponding unsubstituted pyrene containing polymers. Moreover, the polymers showed high sensitivity towards TNT as compared to the other nitroaromatic compounds.

The dynamic strength of concrete material is normally higher than the static strength. Based on extensive experimental data, a number of empirical DIF (dynamic increase factor) relations have been proposed to model concrete material strength increment at high strain rates. Most of these empirical relations are obtained by fitting the scattered dynamic testing data. It is commonly acknowledged that the induced structural effects such as lateral inertia confinement effect are inevitable in high-speed impact tests. Therefore directly fitting the laboratory testing data may not necessarily obtain the true dynamic concrete material properties. Some recent studies investigated the contributions of lateral inertia and end friction confinement effects on DIF of concrete materials in laboratory tests, and proposed relations to remove these influences to obtain the true DIF for concrete materials. The present study carries out numerical simulations of a reinforced concrete wall under different blast loadings. Different DIF relations including CEB defined DIF, DIF proposed in previous studies after removing structural effect in laboratory tests, and NO DIF, i.e., neglecting dynamic strength increment, are considered in numerical simulations. Verification of the numerical model is made through the comparisons of the numerical simulation results with field test data. The results demonstrate that using the new DIF model yields the best prediction of the structural responses. The responses of a typical RC wall under blast loads with a 5. m stand-off distance but different TNT explosive charge weights are also simulated using different DIF relations. The responses of RC wall obtained from numerical models with different DIF relations of concrete material are compared. From the numerical simulation results, the range of scaled distance that DIF relation has significant influences on the numerical simulation results is identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84901054491"

Herein we introduce a correction factor for COSMO-RS that is applicable to a wide range of explosives, and requires no data beyond a quantum chemistry calculation.

Incorporating photothermal/photoacoustic spectroscopic techniques with M/NEMS using quantum cascade lasers can provide the chemical selectivity without sacrificing the sensitivity of the miniaturized sensing system. Point sensing is defined as sensing that requires collection and delivery of the target molecules to the sensor for detection and analysis. For example, photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy, which combines the high thermomechanical sensitivity of a bimetallic microcantilever with high selectivity of the mid infrared (IR) spectroscopy, is capable of obtaining molecular signatures of extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules (tens of picogram). On the other hand, standoff sensing is defined as sensing where the sensor and the operator are at distance from the target samples. Therefore, the standoff sensing is a non-contact method of obtaining molecular signatures without sample collection and processing. The distance of detection depends on the power of IR source, the sensitivity of a detector, and the efficiency of the collecting optics. By employing broadly tunable, high power quantum cascade lasers and a boxcar averager, molecular recognition of trace explosive compounds (1 μg/cm 2 of RDX) on a stainless steel surface has been achieved at a distance of five meters. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905728348"

Briefly, differential reflectometry (DR) shines ultraviolet (UV) and blue light on two close-by areas on a surface (for example, a piece of luggage on a moving conveyer belt). Upon reflection, the light is collected with a spectrometer combined with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. A computer processes the data and produces in turn differential reflection spectra taken from these two adjacent areas on the surface. This differential technique is highly sensitive and provides spectroscopic data of materials, particularly of explosives. As an example, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene displays strong and distinct features in differential reflectograms near 420 and 250 nm, that is, in the near-UV region. Similar, but distinctly different features are observed for other explosives. Finally, a custom algorithm classifies the collected spectral data and outputs an acoustic signal if a threat is detected. This paper presents the complete DR hyperspectral imager which we have designed and built from the hardware to the software, complete with an analysis of the device specifications. © 2014 The Authors.","2-s2.0-84897769211"

The MCs tested are in three groups: nitrobenzenes, nitrotoluenes, and other nitro-aromatics: tetryl, HMX, and RDX. There was a correlation between peak resolution and the number of nitro groups for the nitrobenzenes and nitrotoluenes. The nitro group distance from the methyl for the nitrotoluenes with two nitro groups showed some correlation to the ability to detect as well. Some mixture experiments were conducted in which MCs with three and two nitro groups were detected simultaneously.

A robust and user-friendly portable platform with such capabilities increases the effectiveness of locating and identifying threats while reducing risks to personnel. In 2013 ChemImage Sensor Systems (CISS) introduced Aperio, a handheld sensor, using real-time SWIR HSI for wide area surveillance and standoff detection of explosives, chemical threats, and narcotics. That SWIR HSI system employed a liquid-crystal tunable filter for real-time automated detection and display of threats. In these proceedings, we report on a next generation device called VeroVision™, which incorporates an improved optical design that enhances detection performance at greater standoff distances with increased sensitivity and detection speed. A tripod mounted sensor head unit (SHU) with an optional motorized pan-tilt unit (PTU) is available for precision pointing and sensor stabilization. This option supports longer standoff range applications which are often seen at checkpoint vehicle inspection where speed and precision is necessary. Basic software has been extended to include advanced algorithms providing multi-target display functionality, automatic threshold determination, and an automated detection recipe capability for expanding the library as new threats emerge. In these proceedings, we report on the improvements associated with the next generation portable widefield SWIR HSI sensor, VeroVision™. Test data collected during development are presented in this report which supports the targeted applications for use of VeroVision™ for screening residue and bulk levels of explosive and drugs on vehicles and personnel at checkpoints as well as various applications for other secure areas.

Subsequent finger or palm friction ridge contact with a solid surface, and the application of sufficient pressure, results in particle depositions and particle crushing at the substrate surface within a finger or palm print. These particles and related materials provide an evidentiary trail which is useful for security applications both prior or post to detonation of an explosive device. As such, the optophysicochemical characteristics of these particles are of particular interest for trace explosives detection applications in DOD or DHS arenas. One limiting factor to forensics exploitation is the persistence of these particles so it is important to understand which factors significantly influence their sublimation or decomposition under different conditions. The longevity or stability of explosives particles on a substrate is a function of a range of environmental parameters or particle properties including: Chemical vapor pressure, particle geometry, temperature, airflow, relative humidity, condensation, inclusion chemicals, chemical adlayers, incident light, in some instances the substrate itself and as we show in this work the areal density of the particles covering the substrate. Here, we have studied particles of explosives as pure chemicals, deposited on a glass surface by particle sieving, by photomicroscopy to monitor their sublimation as a function of different experimental variables. Analysis of 2D microscopic images was used to compute and track particle size and geometrical characteristics as a function of time with different test conditions. In this preliminary work a limited set of different test conditions were employed including a range of areal coveragey for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), different particle sizes and a range of airflow rates. The humidity, temperature and substrate were kept constant for each particle type. To perform the experiments a custom flow cell was designed to accommodate a standard microscopy glass slide and to allow in-situ photomicroscopy. The fluidic airflow through the test cell was modelled and flows were selected to provide relevant flow velocities for static and moving applications. For a chemical of interest, we define the radial sublimation velocity (RSV) for the equivalent sphere of a particle as a parameter to characterize the sublimation rate of a material in particle form. The RSV is a useful parameter because it is independent of particle size. The sublimation rate for an ensemble of particles is found to significantly depend on airflow velocity and the areal density of the particles. To establish or estimate the persistence of particles in ambient air we conclude that the particle sizing, airflow conditions and areal density must be known. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905842645"

This is because other effects, such as whipping or water jet impact, often accompany the bubble pulse. This study applied the Eulerian Technique using ABAQUS software to simulate the process of underwater bubble explosion, pulsation and collapse. This approach allows many materials to be used in an Eulerian element and manages with large deformation of materials such as flows and gases. The simulated bubble is equivalent to a bubble generated by 55 g of TNT. Although boundary conditions simplify the model, the method is feasible for simulating bubble dynamics and provides acceptably accurate results on bubble migration in water, pressure pulse, water jet formation, and flow field velocity surrounding the bubble. Future research can use this method to study bubbles, including their interaction with free surfaces and the submerged structures or floating structures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84896772230"

This deep ultraviolet CBE sensor is the result of Army STTR and DTRA programs. The evolving 10 to 15 lb, 20 W, sensor can discriminate CBE from background clutter materials using a fusion of deep UV excited resonance Raman (RR) and laser induced native fluorescence (LINF) emissions collected is less than 1 ms. RR is a method that provides information about molecular bonds, while LINF spectroscopy is a much more sensitive method that provides information regarding the electronic configuration of target molecules. Standoff excitation of suspicious packages, vehicles, persons, and other objects that may contain hazardous materials is accomplished using excitation in the deep UV where there are four main advantages compared to near-UV, visible or near-IR counterparts. 1) Excited between 220 and 250 nm, Raman emission occur within a fluorescence-free region of the spectrum, eliminating obscuration of weak Raman signals by fluorescence from target or surrounding materials. 2) Because Raman and fluorescence occupy separate spectral regions, detection can be done simultaneously, providing an orthogonal set of information to improve both sensitivity and lower false alarm rates. 3) Rayleigh law and resonance effects increase Raman signal strength and sensitivity of detection. 4) Penetration depth into target in the deep UV is short, providing spatial/spectral separation of a target material from its background or substrate. 5) Detection in the deep UV eliminates ambient light background and enable daylight detection. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905841260"

In both cases (either CMO or CE), the sensor surfaces are chemically functionalized with a layer of APhS (trimethoxyphenylsilane) molecules, which give the strongest sensor response for TNT. The construction and calibration of a vapour generator is also presented. The measurements of the sensor response to TNT are performed under equal conditions for both systems, and the results show that CE system with ultrasensitive electronics is far superior to optical detection using MEMS.

Five explosive mixtures in five different diameter tubes were used and the choice of the mixtures included those considered as ""stable"" with regular cellular pattern and ""unstable"" with highly irregular cellular pattern. Photodiodes spaced at regular intervals along the tube were used to measure the detonation velocity. Piezoelectric transducers were also used to record the pressure profiles. Smoked foils were used to register the cellular detonation structure. Away from the limits, the detonation is found to propagate at a steady velocity throughout the length of the tube and the fluctuations of the local velocity are generally small. For stable mixtures with high argon dilution, the onset of the detonation limits is indicated by an abrupt drop in the detonation velocity to about 0.4VCJ after a short distance of travel. The detonation may continue to propagate at this low velocity before decaying eventually to a deflagration wave. For deflagrations the optical detector sometimes failed to register a signal due to low luminosity of the front. In unstable mixtures, galloping detonations are observed only in small diameter tubes (e.g., D=12.7, 3.2 and 1.5mm). A large number of fairly reproducible cycles of galloping detonations can be observed in very small diameter tubes. In large diameter tubes (e.g., D=31.7 and 50.8mm), no galloping detonations are observed in all stable and unstable mixtures. For stable mixtures, no galloping detonations are observed even in small diameter tubes of D=3.2 and 1.5mm. Smoked foils records show that the cellular detonation structure changes from multi-headed to single-headed spin as the limit is approached. In a galloping detonation cycle, a decay from multi-headed to single-headed detonation is observed. However, the cellular structure vanishes for further decay of the galloping detonation to the low velocity phase of the galloping cycle. Although galloping detonations could be considered to define the boundary for detonation limits, this definition lacks generality since galloping detonations are not always observed in all mixtures and in all tube diameters. Thus the onset of single-headed spin is perhaps the most appropriate criterion of the detonation limits in tubes. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-84926277045"

A continuous review of past incidents and disasters to look for common causes and lessons is an essential component to any process safety and loss prevention program. While analyzing the causes of an accident cannot prevent that accident from occurring, learning from it can help to prevent future incidents. The objective of this article is to review a selection of major incidents involving ammonium nitrate in the last century to identify common causes and lessons that can be gleaned from these incidents in the hopes of preventing future disasters. Ammonium nitrate has been involved in dozens of major incidents in the last century, so a subset of major incidents were chosen for discussion for the sake of brevity.

The explosion parameters investigated are: maximum explosion pressure (Pmax), maximum rate of pressure-rise (dP/dt)max, dust explosibility index (KSt), minimum explosible concentration (MEC), minimum ignition energy (MIE), minimum ignition temperature (MIT), limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) and effect of reduced oxygen level on explosion severity. Magnesium particle sizes are: 125, 74, 38, 22, 10 and 1 μm; and 400, 200, 150, 100, 50 and 30 nm. Experimental results indicate significant increase in explosion severity (Pmax: 7-14 bar, KSt: 98-510 bar·m/s) as particle size decreases from 125 to 1 μm, it is maximum for 400 nm (Pmax: 14.6 bar, KSt: 528 bar·m/s) and decreases with further decrease of particle size to nano-range 200-30 nm (Pmax: 12.4-9.4 bar, KSt: 460-262 bar·m/s) as it is affected by agglomeration of nano-particles. MEC decreases from 160 to 30 g/m3 on decreasing particle size from 125 to 1 μm, its value is 30 g/m3 for 400 and 200 nm and 20 g/m3 for further decrease in nano-range (150-30 nm). MIE reduces from 120 to 2 mJ on decreasing the particle size from 125 to 1 μm, its value is 1 mJ for 400, 200, 150 nm size and <1 mJ for 50 and 30 nm. Minimum ignition temperature is 600 °C for 125 μm magnesium, it varies between 570 and 450 °C for sizes 38-1 μm and 400-350 °C for size range 400-30 nm. Magnesium powders in nano-range (30-200 nm) explode less violently than micron-range powder. However, likelihood of explosion increases significantly for nano-range magnesium. LOC is 5% for magnesium size range 125-38 μm, 4% for 22-1 μm, 3% for 400 nm, 4% for 200, 150 and 100 nm, and 5% for 50 and 30 nm.

Firstly, rGO was functionalized with 1,3,6,8-pyrene tetra sulfonic acid sodium salt (PyTS) through π-π interaction among molecules, which could not only improve the solubility and dispersibility of the rGO in aqueous solution but also provide more binding sites for nanoparticles. Secondly, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) were uniformly decorated on the functionalized rGO nanosheets with the help of sulfonic acid group. The obtained nanocomposite (marked as Pd NPs-PyTS/rGO) was then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Finally, the electrochemical sensor was built up by casting Pd NPs-PyTS/rGO on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and electrochemical properties of the nitro aromatic compounds have been studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. The results showed that Pd NPs-PyTS/rGO modified electrode possessed higher electrocatalytic activity and sensitivity for nitrobenzene (NB). The detection limit was as low as 0.62 ppb. This may be attributed to the combination of the large surface area of rGO and effective electrocatalytic property of Pd NPs.

It has long been known that an underwater explosion can cause significantly more damage to the targets in water than the same amount of explosive in air. While the physical processes during an underwater explosion and the subsequent response of structures are extremely complex, which involve lots of complex issues such as the explosion, shock wave propagation, shock wave-structure interaction and structural response. Hence a sophisticated numerical model for the loading and material responses would be required to enable more realistic reproduction of the underlying physical processes. In this paper, a fully coupled numerical approach with combined Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, incorporating the explosion processes, is performed. The RHT (Riedel-Hiermaier-Thoma) model including the strain rate effect is employed to model the concrete material behavior subjected to blast loading. Detailed numerical simulation and analysis of a typical concrete gravity dam subjected to underwater explosion are presented in this study. In terms of different TNT charge weights, the structural response and damage characteristics of the dam at different standoff distances are investigated.

A protective structure model with four layers and a metal casing filled with TNT charge (MCTC) which was used to simulate the warhead of an anti-ship weapon were designed and manufactured. An experiment was conducted in which the MCTC exploded inside an empty cabin of the first layer of the multi-layer protective structure.

Our preliminary experimental and numerical modeling have established that AN-containing HME in the subsurface can, in all likelihood, be detected by electromagnetic exploration geophysics techniques, specifically by ground penetrating radar (GPR) and by electromagnetic induction (EMI).

The combination of a resonant cavity perturbation technique for determining the room-temperature complex dielectric constant at discrete frequencies and a wide band open circuit method (1-18 GHz) provides an accurate, broadband measurement that describes the dielectric properties in the frequency range of interest. While the values of the real and imaginary permittivity components did not vary significantly as a function of frequency, we found the real part of the permittivity to be highly dependent on relatively small changes in the material density.

In this study, the effect of temperature on pipe bomb containers (i.e., PVC, black steel and galvanized steel) containing low explosive fillers (i.e., Pyrodex and double-base smokeless powder (DBSP)) was investigated. Measurements of fragment velocity and mass were compared for similar devices exploded in the spring (low/high temperature was 8. °C/21. °C) and winter (low/high temperature range was -9. °C/-3. °C). The explosions were captured using high speed filmography and fragment velocities were plotted as particle vector velocity maps (PVVM). The time that elapsed between the initiation of the winter devices containing double-base smokeless powder (DBSP) and the failure of their pipe containers ranged from 5.4 to 8.1. ms. The maximum fragment velocities for these devices ranged from 332 to 567. m/s. The steel devices ruptured and exploded more quickly than the PVC device. The steel devices also generated fragments with higher top speeds. Distributions of fragment masses were plotted as histograms and fragment weight distribution maps (FWDM). As expected, steel devices generated fewer, larger fragments than did the PVC devices. Comparison to devices exploded in the spring revealed several pieces of evidence for temperature effects on pipe bombs. For example, the mean fragment velocities for the winter devices were at or above those observed in the spring. The maximum fragment velocity was also higher for the winter steel devices. Although there were no significant differences in mean relative fragment mass, the fragment weight distribution maps (FWDMs) for two winter devices had anomalous slopes, where lower energy filler caused more severe fragmentation than higher energy filler. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84896929360"

Addition of strong acids to TATP can cause an explosive reaction, while reaction with dilute acid reduces the decomposition rate so drastically that gentle destruction of TATP is impractical. However, combined use of dilute acid with slightly solvated TATP made gentle destruction of TATP feasible. Variables including acid type, concentration, solvent and ratios thereof have been explored, along with kinetics, in an attempt to provide a field-safe technique for gently destroying this homemade primary explosive. The preferred method is moistening TATP with an alcoholic solution (aqueous methanol, ethanol, or iso-propanol) followed by addition of 36 wt-% hydrochloric acid.

Current classifications neither describe this injury pattern well, nor correlate with management. There is need for a new classification, to aid communication between clinicians, and help evaluate interventions and outcomes. We propose such a classification, and present the results of an initial prospective evaluation. Patients and methods: The classification was developed by a panel of military surgeons whilst deployed to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Injuries were divided into five classes, by anatomic level. Segmental injuries were recognised as a distinct entity. Associated injuries to the intraperitoneal abdomen, genitalia and perineum, pelvic ring, and upper limbs, which impact on clinical management and resources, were also accounted for. Results: Between 1 November 2010 and 20 February 2011, 179 IED-related lower limb injuries in 103 consecutive casualties were classified, and their subsequent vascular and musculoskeletal treatment recorded. 69% of the injuries were traumatic amputations, and the remainder segmental injuries. 49% of casualties suffered bilateral lower limb amputation. The most common injury was class 3 (involving proximal lower leg or thigh, permitting effective above-knee tourniquet application, 49%), but more proximal patterns (class 4 or 5, preventing effective tourniquet application) accounted for 18% of injuries. Eleven casualties had associated intraperitoneal abdominal injuries, 41 suffered genital or perineal injuries, 9 had pelvic ring fractures, and 66 had upper limb injuries. The classification was easy to apply and correlated with management. Conclusions: The 'Bastion classification' is a pragmatic yet clinically relevant injury categorisation, which describes current injury patterns well, and should facilitate communication between clinicians, and the evaluation of interventions and outcomes. The validation cohort confirms that the injury burden from IEDs in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan remains high, with most casualties sustaining amputation through or above the knee. The rates of associated injury to the abdomen, perineum, pelvis and upper limbs are high. These findings have important implications for the training of military surgeons, staffing and resourcing of medical treatment facilities, to ensure an adequate skill mix to manage these complex and challenging injuries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84905491641"

NMR sample tubes have been impregnated by an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO2). They were subsequently dried and examined by 14N quadrupole resonance. To our surprise, we were able to observe a signal at the right frequency (4.64 MHz, the highest frequency NaNO2 line). This implies that the material has been properly embedded but also that sodium nitrite was properly recrystallized. This latter point was more than speculative. Anyway, we could observe that it works for spruce, beech, ash, maritime pine, but not for oak (which is known to be difficult to impregnate). Instrumental parameters have been optimized for reducing the duration of the experiment.

However, in many cases, the laser intensities needed restrict the applications where they can be safely used. A new generation imaging Raman system has been developed based on a 355 nm UV laser that, in addition to eye safety, allows discrete and invisible measurements. Non-dangerous exposure levels for the eye are several orders of magnitude higher in UVA than in the visible range that previously has been used. The UV Raman system has been built based on an UV Fabry-Perot Interferometer (UV-FPI) developed by VTT. The design allows for precise selection of Raman shifts in combination with high out-of-band blocking. The stable operation of the UV-FPI module under varying environmental conditions is arranged by controlling the temperature of the module and using a closed loop control of the FPI air gap based on capacitive measurement. The system presented consists of a 3rd harmonics Nd:YAG laser with 1.5 W average output at 1000 Hz, a 200 mm Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, UV-FPI filter and an ICCD camera for signal gating and detection. The design principal leads to a Raman spectrum in each image pixel. The system is designed for field use and easy manoeuvring. Preliminary results show that in measurements of <60 s on 10 m distance, single AN particles of <300 μm diameter can be identified. © 2014 SPIE.16.","2-s2.0-84904731390"

During the past few years, we explored the use of simultaneous multiple-excitation-wavelengths (MEW) in resonance Raman spectroscopy. This approach takes advantage of Raman band intensity variations across the Resonance Raman spectra obtained from two or more excitation wavelengths. Amplitude variations occur between corresponding Raman bands in Resonance Raman spectra due to complex interplay of resonant enhancement, self-absorption and laser penetration depth. We have developed a very sensitive algorithm to estimate concentration of an analyte from spectra obtained using the MEW technique. The algorithm uses correlations and least-square minimization approach to calculate an estimate for the concentration. For two or more excitation wavelengths, measured spectra were stacked in a two dimensional matrix. In a simple realization of the algorithm, we approximated peaks in the ideal library spectra as triangles. In this work, we present the performance of the algorithm with measurements obtained from a dual-excitation-wavelength Resonance Raman sensor. The novel sensor, developed at WVHTCF, detects explosives from a standoff distance. The algorithm was able to detect explosives with very high sensitivity even at signal-to-noise ratios as low as ~1.6. Receiver operating characteristics calculated using the algorithm showed a clear benefit in using the dual-excitation-wavelength technique over single-excitation-wavelength techniques. Variants of the algorithm that add more weight to amplitude variation information showed improved specificity to closely resembling spectra. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84904728269"

The function of chloride modifiers was to substitute Cl-(H 2O)n for O2-(H2O)n in the drift region so as to avoid the overlap between O2-(H2O)n and sulfur ion peaks. Among CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and CCl4, CCl4 was chosen as the modifier due to the best peak-to-peak resolution and stability towards the fluctuation of modifier concentration. With 1.4 ppm CCl4 as the modifier, the minimum detectable quantity of 0.1 ng for sulfur was achieved. Moreover, this method showed the ability for detection of common explosives at sub-nanogram level, such as black powder (BP), ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). In summary, this method requiring no configuration modification has high sensitivity and selectivity, and consumes trace amount of modifier.

The video footage was used to calculate fragment velocities, which were represented as particle velocity vector maps. In addition, the fragments were weighed. The results demonstrate a correlation between the type of energetic filler and both the size and velocity of the fragments.

To meet this challenge a sensor needs to exhibit high specificity and high sensitivity in detection at low signal-to-noise ratio levels. We had proposed a Dual-Excitation- Wavelength Resonance-Raman Detector (DEWRRED) to address this need. In our previous work, we discussed various components designed at WVHTCF for a DEWRRED sensor. In this work, we show a completely assembled laboratory prototype of a DEWRRED sensor and utilize it to detect explosives from two standoff distances. The sensor system includes two novel, compact CW deep-Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, a compact dual-band high throughput DUV spectrometer, and a highly-sensitive detection algorithm. We choose DUV excitation because Raman intensities from explosive traces are enhanced and fluorescence and solar background are not present. The DEWRRED technique exploits the excitation wavelength dependence of Raman signal strength, arising from complex interplay of resonant enhancement, self-absorption and laser penetration depth. We show measurements from >10 explosives/pre-cursor materials at different standoff distances. The sensor showed high sensitivity in explosive detection even when the signalto- noise ratio was close to one (~1.6).

The presence of metal powders is not detected by these approaches, and further the powders themselves scatter the laser radiation used in the excitation of the spectra, making other components more difficult to discern.

For the rationable design, it is useful to have a quantitative criterion to determine at which maximum distance the standoff can be placed to assume a uniform pressure distribution. Surprisingly, no standard criterion was found in the literature and the effect of blast wave clearing was not considered as well. In this paper, pressure histories applied on structures are calculated considering the non-uniform loading characteristic as well as pressure relief from the edges. Additionally, the effects of various parameters on uniformity of impulse distribution are investigated. The results have shown that the effect of pressure relief on impulse uniformity is very important, especially when the blast wave is attenuated.

These methods extract features from known examples of target responses to train a statistical classifier. The statistical classifiers are then used to identify targets emplaced in previously unseen conditions. Due to the variation in target GPR responses caused by factors such as differing soil conditions, classifiers require training on a large, varied dataset to encompass the signal variation expected in operational conditions. These training collections generally involve burying each target type in a number of soil conditions, at a number of burial depths. The cost associated with both burying the targets, and collecting the data is extremely high. Thus, the conditions and depths sampled cover only a subset of possible scenarios. The goal of this research is to improve the ability of a classifier to generalize to new conditions by deforming target responses in accordance with the physical properties of GPR signals. These signal deformations can simulate a target response under different conditions than those represented in the data collection. This research shows that improved detection performance in previously unseen conditions can be achieved by utilizing deformations, even when the training dataset is limited. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905686512"
