The safety of working with these materials in the laboratory is the greatest limiting factor preventing HME research. A vapor delivery tool, the Mixed Vapor Generation Device (MV-Gen), was designed to safely contain the individual solid or liquid components that often compose homemade explosives vapor plumes and deliver the mixed component vapors for instrumental sampling and analysis. Within the MV-Gen, each component is separated and only the vapors mix as they are carried through the device by flowing air. The resulting mixed vapor is representative of either mixed explosive material or bulk explosives. Component materials are held in up to four individual, removable vials with vapor concentrations controlled by vial orifice size, temperature, and diluent airflow. The total concentration can be adjusted by altering vial temperature via a thermal water jacket surrounding the entirety of the device, or by adjusting the flow rate of diluent air through the device. The MV-Gen was evaluated first with surrogate compounds, followed by two types of homemade explosives, to include a binary explosive mixture and a peroxide explosive. To evaluate the device, vapors were cold-trapped on an online sampling system and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was determined that the device yielded reproducible vapor concentrations of both single and mixed components, and the ratio of these vapors can be easily adjusted to mimic varying forms of homemade explosives. © 2018","2-s2.0-85049984452"

Recent improvements have focused on expanding PRIED's capabilities to include near-trace detection of explosives at 1-2m range on fluorescent substrates.

A suitably modified Bachmann process, nitrolysis of solid hexamine in the presence of ammonium nitrate-nitric acid and acetic anhydride on a laboratory scale, is introduced to increase the efficiency, production capacity and purity of the DPT produced. Various quantitative and qualitative analytical methods were used for the identification and quality control of the product. A central composite design (CCD) of experiments was used to optimize the production process, increasing the production capacity, reducing the amount of acetic acid as the reaction medium to a suitable limit, and examining the effects of the main factors impacting on the efficiency of the nitration, e.g. the volume of ammonium nitrate-nitric acid solution, nitration temperature reactor addition time and volume of acetic anhydride. The overall results indicated that DPT was obtained with an efficiency of 64.58% and a production capacity of 20.77 (100 g·mL-1). © 2018 Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry, Poland.","2-s2.0-85043387012"

The unsolved problems are how can we detect drug, TATP and nitro aromatic explosives with the same device, how can we distinguish different explosives and drugs, and how can we avoid false alarms; solving these problems are crucial for world security. We have developed a new synthetic conjugated polymer with single molecule layer and coated on porous silicon with large surface area to increase quenching signal at least one order, based on this new film a small handheld explosive detector with sensitivities of 0.1 pg for TNT and 0.1 ng for black gun powder are obtained. Many explosives and drugs (such as TNT, RDX, PETN, black gun powder, cocaine, etc.) have been tested, from their quenching curves and our data base we are able to distinguish them qualitatively and avoid false alarms. Therefore we believe our detector can be used not only for battle field but also for airports, government entrances and other security check points. Last year, after face to face competition, our device was selected as the only security detector for the G20 summit held in Hangzhou, China.

In recent years, high quality data from experiments using embedded gauges and other diagnostic techniques have inspired the development of a range of new high-fidelity computer models for explosives. The experiments and models have led to new insights, both at the continuum scale applicable to most shock and detonation experiments, and at the mesoscale relevant to hotspots and burning within explosive microstructures. This article reviews the continuum and mesoscale models, and their application to explosive phenomena, gaining insights to aid future model development and improved understanding of the physics of shock initiation and detonation propagation. In particular, it is argued that ""desensitization"" and the effect of porosity on high explosives can both be explained by the combined effect of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, rather than the traditional hotspot-based explanations linked to pressure-dependent reaction rates. © British Crown Owned Copyright 2018/AWE.","2-s2.0-85044734841"

Quantum chemical calculations provided detailed insight into the thermolysis mechanism of DAT missing in the existing literature. Moreover, several contradictory assumptions on the mechanism and key intermediates of thermolysis were resolved. The unimolecular primary decomposition reactions of the seven isomers of DAT were studied in the gas phase and in the melt using a simplified model of the latter. The two-step reaction of N2 elimination from the diamino tautomer was found to be the primary decomposition process of DAT in the gas phase and melt. The effective Arrhenius parameters of this process were calculated to be Ea = 43.4 kcal mol-1 and log(A/s-1) = 15.2 in a good agreement with the experimental values. Contrary to the existing literature data, all other decomposition channels of DAT isomers turned out to be kinetically unimportant. Apart from this, a new primary decomposition channel yielding N2, cyanamide, and 1,1-diazene was found for some H-bonded dimers of DAT. We also determined a reliable and mutually consistent set of thermochemical values for DAT (ΔfHsolid0 = 74.5 ± 1.5 kcal·mol-1) by combining theoretically calculated (W1 multilevel procedure along with an isodesmic reaction) gas phase enthalpy of formation (ΔfHgas0 = 100.7 ± 1.0 kcal·mol-1) and experimentally measured sublimation enthalpy (ΔsubH0 = 26.2 ± 0.5 kcal·mol-1). © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85045690102"

Its modelling is instrumental for the accurate prediction of the performance of these explosives. Because of the high temperature of detonation products, the chemical reactions are mixing-driven. Modelling afterburning thus relies on the precise description of the mixing process inside fireballs. This work presents a joint numerical and experimental study of a non-reacting reduced-scale set-up, which uses the compressed balloon analogy and does not involve the detonation of a high explosive. The set-up produces a flow similar to the one caused by a spherical detonation and allows focusing on the mixing process. The numerical work is composed of 2D and 3D LES simulations of the set-up. It is shown that grid independence can be reached by imposing perturbations at the edge of the fireball. The results compare well with the existing literature and give new insights on the mixing process inside fireballs. In particular, they highlight the fact that the mixing layer development follows an energetic scaling law but remains sensitive to the density ratio between the detonation products and air. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85042419525"

Suffering from the small Raman scattering efficiency, this system perusing large detection distance requires both large power consumption and optical system, which blocks its applications. In order to seek for high signal collection efficient, in this work, we designed a 2-inch refractive telescope system, and obtained 20 m detection distance using a frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd: YAG laser with pulse energy of 30 mJ. By adjusting the excitation energy through a variable attenuator, we investigate the interrelations of input power, the signal and the noise consisting of the internal and signal-induced noises. For both main peak and sub peak, the signal-induced noises are subject to a power function of the signal intensity, and can be filtered and smoothed by the norm-distribution-function weighted moving average method (WMAM) without the loss of the signal information. After transforming the correlation spectrum, defined by the multiplication of the noise and signal spectrum, iteratively by WMAM, we can identify the small signal of about 1 count beyond the internal noise limitation. With help of the iteration method, the requirement of integration time as well as the excitation energy can be greatly reduced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85063745415"

Recent developments have demonstrated that an optical biomimetic sensing approach, based on human-eye color detection can provide high-confidence discrimination of target chemicals while rejecting potential interferents with similar chemical structures. This biomimetic sensing method operates by identifying differences in the overlap between target and interferent chemical infrared absorption bands utilizing three, overlapping, optical bandpass filters. This method is non-spectroscopic and requires only the use of commercially available, off-the-shelf optical components. This approach has been demonstrated for volatile chemical vapors in the mid-wave-infrared (3 - 5 μm). Based on this success, experimental studies of this biomimetic sensing approach have been expanded further into the long wave infrared spectral region (6 - 12 μm) and for detection of explosives on surfaces, including aluminum and plastics. We present discrimination results using this biomimetic sensing approach for explosive samples on surfaces in both the mid- and long- wave infrared. Numerical data, along with experimentally collected data, are discussed.

Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis was used to show that photo-induced electron transfer (PET) is the underlying mechanism behind the luminescence quenching of the probe upon exposure to TNT, the rationality of which was further confirmed by the recording of a high charge transfer rate.

In this study, silica nanopores membrane modified screen printed electrodes were applied in a smartphone-based electrochemiluminescence system for nitroaromatic explosives detection. Universal serial bus-on the go (USB-OTG) and camera on smartphone were used as the electrical stimulation and luminescence capture, respectively. ⎕Multimode methods including (red-green-blue) RGB, (hue-saturation-brightness) HSB, and Gray were proposed for luminescence analysis. Specific polypeptides were immobilized on the nanopores modified electrodes for nitroaromatic explosives sensing. With positive-charged tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)                             3                                                          2+                             ) as electrochemiluminescence label, the increase in luminescence was associated with the selective ion channels and the well-conductive electron channels in the negative-charged nanopores. Besides, on account of the large specific surface area, nanopores modified screen printed electrodes showed stable and uniform luminescence. Results showed that the nanopores-enhanced electrochemiluminescence on smartphone covered a linear dynamic range from 10                             −7                              mg/mL to 10                             −3                              mg/mL for nitroaromatic explosives detection with the detection limit of 2.3 × 10                             −9                              mg/mL.

In the last few years, explosive detection systems for cabin baggage screening (EDSCB) have become available. Although used by a number of airports, most countries have not yet implemented these systems on a wide scale. We investigated the benefits of EDSCB with two different levels of automation currently being discussed by regulators and airport operators: automation as a diagnostic aid with an on-screen alarm resolution by the airport security officer (screener) or EDSCB with an automated decision by the machine. The two experiments reported here tested and compared both scenarios and a condition without automation as baseline. Participants were screeners at two international airports who differed in both years of work experience and familiarity with automation aids. Results showed that experienced screeners were good at detecting improvised explosive devices even without EDSCB. EDSCB increased only their detection of bare explosives. In contrast, screeners with less experience (tenure < 1 year) benefitted substantially from EDSCB in detecting both improvised explosive devices and bare explosives. A comparison of all three conditions showed that automated decision provided better human–machine detection performance than on-screen alarm resolution and no automation. This came at the cost of slightly higher false alarm rates on the human–machine system level, which would still be acceptable from an operational point of view. Results indicate that a wide-scale implementation of EDSCB would increase the detection of explosives in passenger bags and automated decision instead of automation as diagnostic aid with on screen alarm resolution should be considered. © 2018 The Authors","2-s2.0-85047220215"

The details of the interaction between an HE detonation and its confinement are essential to achieving the objectives of the explosive device. For the high pressures induced by detonation loading, both the solid HE and confiner materials will flow. The structure and speed of a propagating detonation, and ultimately the pressures generated in the reaction zone to drive the confiner, depend on the induced flow both within the confiner and along the HE-confiner material interface. The detonation-confiner interactions are heavily influenced by the material properties and, in some cases, the thickness of the confiner. This review discusses the use of oblique shock polar analysis as a means of characterizing the possible range of detonation-confiner interactions. Computations that reveal the fluid mechanics of HE detonation-confiner interactions for finite reaction-zone length detonations are discussed and compared with the polar analysis. This includes cases of supersonic confiner flow; subsonic, shock-driven confiner flow; subsonic, but shockless confiner flow; and sonic flow at the intersection of the detonation shock and confiner material interface.

However, the efficacy of simulations is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the equations of state (EOS) and reactive burn models used to characterize the energetic materials. So we're left with a conundrum: we can save the time and money of an extensive testing program, but we must start with a test program sufficient to establish confidence in our modeling parameters. And there is still an urgent need to develop new energetic materials, as the need for more ""tailored"" energetics is an ongoing concern. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using the components of an explosive fill as discrete elements in a simulation, based solely on the relative amounts of the constituents. This is accomplished by assembling a mosaic, or ""checkerboard"", in which each block is made up of the same relative amounts of the constituents as the overall mixture. It is assumed that each constituent has a well-defined set of simulation parameters. We are not considering the actual underlying microstructure, and so we recognize there will be significant limitations to the usefulness of this technique, but we are interested in determining whether there are applications for which this technique might prove useful, in the absence of experimental data on the full energetic material. As an initial test of the concept, three binary explosives were considered: Comp-B, Pentolite and LX-04. We considered various inserted shapes, and compared the results from simulations using the base explosive with our checkerboard fill, in simulations of the basic detonation rate, as well as simulations of cylinder expansion (cylex) and gap tests. © 2018 Author(s).","2-s2.0-85049793852"

In this paper, we describe a new method for detection of TATP, thermal decomposition peroxy radical chemical amplification cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-PERCA-CRDS). In this method, air is sampled through a heated inlet to which ~ 1 ppmv nitric oxide (NO) is added. To verify the purity of synthetic standards, the mid-infrared spectrum of TATP vapor was recorded. The thermal decomposition of TATP is shown to produce radicals which oxidize NO to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), whose concentration increase is monitored by optical absorption at 405 nm using a blue diode laser CRDS. The sensitivity could be improved through addition of ~ 1% ethane (C2H6), which fuels catalytic conversion of NO to NO2. The limit of detection of TD-PERCA-CRDS with respect to TATP is 22 pptv (1 s data), approximately six orders of magnitude below TATP’s saturation vapor pressure.

The mechanism of nitric oxide (NO/NO+) sensing is based on N-nitrosation of aromatic secondary amine, which was not interfered by reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. The aggregation-induced enhancement of emission (AIEE) behaviors of the PyDA-NP could be attributed to the restriction of intramolecular rotation and vibration, resulting in rigidity enhancement of the molecules. The AIEE behavior of the probe was well established from fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, optical fluorescence microscopy, and time-resolved photoluminescence studies. In a H2O/CH3CN binary mixture (8:2 v/v), the probe showed maximum aggregation with extensive (833-fold) increases in fluorescence intensity and high quantum yield (0.79).

Hence, understanding the response of EMs to an EEF is greatly meaningful for their safe usage. Herein, the structural arrangement, a crucial factor in the impact sensitivity and detonation performance of EMs, under the EEF ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 V/Å was investigated via molecular dynamics simulation. Nitromethane (NM) was taken as a case study due to the simple structure. The simulation results show that there exists a critical EEF strength between 0.2 and 0.3 V/Å, which can induce the transition of NM molecules from relatively disordered distribution to solidlike ordered and compacted arrangement with a large density. In this ordered structure, NM dipoles are aligned in a head-to-tail pattern parallel to the EEF direction because of the favored dipole-dipole interactions and weak C-H···O hydrogen bonds. As the EEF strength is enhanced, the potential energy and cohesive energy density of the NM system gradually decrease and increase, respectively, indicative of high thermodynamics stability of ordered arrangement.

Detection is typically accomplished in less one second. The detection method is solar blind and can be employed at standoff distances up to 5 m or more without interference from natural or man-made light sources. By this method, unknown suspicious powders, that potentially contain biological hazards, are automatically triaged using a four-step sequential iteration of Principal Component Analysis methods using pre-determined eigenvector sets to: 1) detect and differentiate whether a sample is bio or non-bio; 2) whether the detected bio is microbial, protein, or plant; 3) if microbial, whether the sample is a bacterial cell or spore, yeast, fungi, or fungal spore; and 4) to provide some higher level of cellular differentiability. The same method is also applicable to a wide range of chemical agents and explosives materials.

Second, the late time of the scattering signal is estimated using a simple cross correlation. Third, a few successive poles are extracted from the scattering response at the estimated late time by using the short-time matrix pencil method.

The first method of encoding information about an explosive was simply writing desired information on the explosive's packaging. Marking explosives in this way can be considered the first identification taggant. Identification taggants that encode information have evolved over the course of over 100 years in the United States. Identification taggants are particularly useful as they allow explosives to be tracked back to the manufacturer and purchaser. Correlations can be seen in the evolutional advances in identification taggants and events (wars and terrorist activities) that lead to regulations governing explosives. The information presented in this paper walks through the evolution of identification taggants, since 1917, and identifies the corresponding event that led to increased regulations governing explosives. The paper illustrates that the efforts in identification taggants have been primarily reactionary and highlights the need for a more proactive approach in taggant research and implementation. Understanding the previously developed identification taggants has led to successive generations of taggant candidates, including a modern candidate known as the Nuclear Barcode. The nuclear barcode focuses on allowing identification taggant to survive the detonation process intact, prevent counterfeiting or obscuration, enhance forensic detection of explosives, as well as providing a sufficiently large number of potential codes to enable labeling individual batches of product. The nuclear barcode is designed to accomplish these goals inexpensively while also not affecting the properties or sensitivity of the tagged explosive. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

So, the purpose of this paper is to provide details of sensors based on selective nanocoatings by combining trinitrotoluene (TNT) receptors (Trp-His-Trp) bound to conjugated polydiacetylene polymers on a graphene channel in GFET for detecting explosives TNT. Design/methodology/approach - Following an introduction, this paper describes the way of manufacturing of the GFET sensor by using investigation methods for transferring graphene sheet from Cu foil to target substrates, which is functionalized by the TNT peptide receptors, to offer a system which has the capability of answering the presence of related target molecules (TNT). Finally, brief conclusions are drawn. Findings - In a word, shortly after graphene discovery, it has been explored with a variety of methods gradually. Because of its exceptional electrical properties (e.g. extremely high carrier mobility and capacity), electrochemical properties such as high electron transfer rate and structural properties, graphene has already showed great potential and success in chemical and biological sensing fields. Therefore, the authors used a biological receptor with a field effect transistor (FET) based on graphene to fabricate sensor for achieving high sensitivity and selectivity that can detect explosive substances such as TNT. The transport property changed compared to that of the FET made by intrinsic graphene, that is, the Dirac point position moved from positive Vg to negative Vg, indicating the transition of graphene from p-type to n-type after annealing in TNT, and the results show the bipolar property change of GFET with the TNT concentration and the possibility to develop a robust, easy-to-use and low-cost TNT detection method for performing a sensitive, reliable and semi-quantitative detection in a wide detection range. Originality/value - In this timeframe of history, TNT is a common explosive used in both military and industrial settings. Its convenient handling properties and explosive strength make it a common choice in military operations and bioterrorism. TNT and other conventional explosives are the mainstays of terrorist bombs and the anti-personnel mines that kill or injure more than 15,000 people annually in war-torn countries. In large, openair environments, such as airports, train stations and minefields, concentrations of these explosives can be vanishingly small - a few parts of TNT, for instance, per trillion parts of air. That can make it impossible for conventional bomb and mine detectors to detect the explosives and save lives. So, in this paper, the authors report a potential solution with design and manufacture of a GFET sensor based on a biological receptor for real-time detection of TNT explosives specifically. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85043270219"

In the case of trace analytes, a long pre-accumulation time to increase their adsorption at the modified electrodes is needed, and the sensitivity is greatly limited by the strength of redox signals of target species. The direct approach is particularly not suitable for analyzing weak/reductive trinitramine explosives. Herein, we report a non-reductive electrochemical sensor for the ultrasensitive real-time detection of pM-level trinitrotoluene (TNT). Ultratrace TNT can substantially prevent the reversible redox of PANI ultrathin layers at gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite electrode, resulting in the decrease in oxidative peak currents of PANI. The voltammetric response is fast (almost immediate) and is greatly amplified by AuNPs. The detection limit for analyzing TNT is 4 ppt (18 pM).

Also, subsequent decomposition of AN during high-temperature transients may lead to the undesired formation of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas. Quantification of AN formation and decomposition has been not adequately addressed so far due to experimental difficulties. We propose an original method for measuring the amount of AN formed on SCR catalysts, and validate it in bench-flow runs over a commercial Cu-CHA formulation. In order to quantify the AN on the catalyst, we rely on its reaction with NO according to NO + NH4NO3 → NO2 + N2 + 2H2O, further investigated via DRIFTs in this work. Based on this stoichiometry, the amount of deposited AN can be estimated from the integral molecular balances of reliably and precisely measurable species, such as NO and NO2. This approach is initially applied over catalyst powder in a rig where N-balances could be evaluated directly, and subsequently validated over more realistic coated monolith catalyst samples in a bench-flow reactor in which N2 was used as carrier gas. In the validation tests, known amounts of AN were initially deposited on the catalyst by controlled pre-dosing of an AN aqueous solution: such amounts were found in satisfactory agreement with the estimates obtained by our method. We expect the proposed methodology for AN quantification to be generally applicable to other types of SCR catalysts as well, including V-based systems and Fe-zeolites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85018759140"

In order to provide additional information for the AIT assessment, we are developing a technique that enables the identification of threat composition based on dielectric constant. The dielectric constant is extracted from the spectral content of the broadband holographic imaging data. The technique is demonstrated from images collected in a prototype personnel-screening system. The dielectric constant is obtained by numerically fitting the reflection coeficient as a function of frequency to an optical model. The reflection coefficient is a function of frequency because of propagation effects, such as multiple reflections and energy loss, that are associated with the material's complex dielectric constant. In order to accomplish the analysis using an imaging system, the spectrum is obtained from an integration of the reflectivity image spectrum, which is an intermediate result in the image reconstruction algorithm. The present use of an imaging array demonstrates the ability to detect dielectric constant in small areas on a complex target.

Based on DSD (Detonation Shock Dynamics) theory and a linear assumption for the streamline deflection angle, this paper proposes a theoretical model for curved detonation wave propagation in cylinder-type micro-channel charges within a strong confinement of metal tube. Further, dynamic control equations related to the detonation velocity and charge diameter are deduced, a numerical calculation method of detonation velocity and shock front shape is given, and propagation rules for detonation waves with different diameters are obtained. An experiment was designed to test the detonation velocities for micro-channel charges with a booster explosive. The results closely agree with calculations, validating the propagation model of curved detonation waves. It was found that the detonation velocity loss and shock front curvature in the central axis decreased with increasing diameter in the calculation range. Moreover, the smaller the diameter, the greater the rate of change. It is also shown that the model is suitable for the prediction of diameter effects in micro-channel charges, which is of significance for structural design and performance optimization in MEMS initiation systems. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It allows pointwise noncontact measurements of dynamic effects. In recent years, it has been applied as a sensor in photoacoustic/photothermal spectroscopy to detect hazardous chemicals or explosive substances in an open environment. In photoacoustic spectroscopy, normally the analysis has to be conducted in a sealed space to enable signal detection, either through a high-sensitivity microphone, or a piezo-sensor coupled with a lock-in amplifier. In addition, the requirement for sample preparation prior to analysis is an impediment preventing practical adoption of the technique in real-time, standoff chemical detection deployments in an open environment. The research team has previously demonstrated the feasible use of a laser interferometric technique to detect photo-vibrational signals of trace chemicals because it was excited by an intensity-modulated quantum cascade laser (QCL). In this study, our long distance laser Doppler vibrometer developed in house was demonstrated to be able to detect the vibration amplitude and frequency of trace explosives at long standoff distances of 100 m in an open environment. Three explosives of 10 µg/mm2 concentration were tested, and the photo-vibrational spectrum obtained by scanning the output wavelength of the QCL through the mid-IR range, coincides well with the corresponding spectrum obtained using typical FTIR equipment.

In this paper, the detection of trace 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (DNT) as a nitroaromatic explosive based on heat absorption monitoring (HAM) is introduced which employs heat absorption phenomenon during melting process of explosive particles. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the sensitivity of HAM sensor will be enhanced by increasing of heating efficiency; therefore, the sensor has been designed based on suspended-type membrane (STM) micro-hotplate with the small active area and narrow tethers to achieve high heating efficiency. The designed sensor is fabricated by a simple micro-fabrication process using bulk micromachining technology and the electrical and thermal characterization is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the fabricated HAM sensor is capable of detecting DNT as little as 20 ppb within 72 ms by the applying power of 3.7 mW. Moreover, the fabricated sensor shows higher selectivity to DNT than other explosives when it is regulated to the melting point of DNT, and to detect DNT concentrations above 150ppb, run-to-run repeatability and device-to-device reproducibility are better than 4%–9%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85042233209"

The criterion is employed to distinguish between two different propagation modes of one-dimensional (1-D) freely propagating premixed flames, that is the canonical deflagration wave controlled by heat and species back-diffusion, which features a unique flame speed, and the auto-ignition controlled reaction front propagation, which may feature an arbitrary propagation speed. In the CEMA based diagnostic, the local chemistry and diffusion source terms are projected to the chemical explosive mode (CEM), such that the roles of diffusion and chemistry in the CEM can be quantified and compared for identification of the flame propagation mode. The new criterion is further applied to analyze two-dimensional (2-D) DNS datasets of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion of n-heptane/air with different levels of thermal stratification. Both flame propagation modes are observed and contribute significantly to the overall flame burning in the case with a high level of thermal stratification, while the flame propagation is found dominated by the auto-ignition mode in the case with a low level of thermal stratification, which agrees with the finding in previous studies. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-85050888180"

Density functional theory was used to evaluate the relative binding interaction energies between halogen-containing sensor model molecules and nitro-containing explosives. Interaction energies ranged from ?18 to ?14 kJ/mol and highly directional halogen bonding interactions were observed with bond distances ranging between 3.0 and 3.4 Å. In all geometry optimized structures, the sigma-hole of electropositive potential on the halogen aligned with a lone pair of electrons on the nitro-moiety of the explosive. The computational results predict that the strongest interactions will occur with iodine-based sensors as, of all the halogens studied, iodine is the largest, most polarizable halogen with the smallest electronegativity. Based on these promising proof-of-concept results, synthetically accessible sensors were designed using 1,4-dihalobenzene (X = Cl, Br, and I) with and without tetra-fluoro electron withdrawing groups attached to the benzene ring.

Furthermore, mercury lamp was employed to represent the outdoor environment. The reflected and emitted light of each tested explosive material was collected using hyperspectal camera to generate cubic images. The variation of reflected energy as function of wavelength was employed to generate characteristic spectrum of each explosive material.

Detection systems have to be tested and validated with realistic samples and amounts as early as possible during the development. However, at present, well defined and homogeneous test materials which are a crucial requirement for development and validation of trace detection systems are not available. Existing preparation methods of reference samples, such as drop-And-dry (drop casting) methods, present a range of variability and reproducibility issues, including inhomogeneous sample coverage and material waste. Especially for the preparation of samples for optical stand-off technologies the drop-on-demand and inkjet printing technology could be a promising method of producing standardized chemically contaminated test materials with high accuracy, precision, scalability, and flexibility to allow for the inexpensive, high-Throughput production. Test samples with contaminations ranging from nanogrammes to microgrammes have been prepared and analysed over several weeks of storage. The influence of plot parameters on the morphology and durability of printed samples of various common explosives have been investigated on different substrates. HPLC measurements were made to quantitatively evaluate the durability of printed samples. The morphology of the test samples was additionally characterized by optical microscopy and confocal Raman-microscopy. Besides the occurrence of polymorphic phase changes, described in literature for low concentrated drop-on-demand samples of RDX, we observed changes in sample distribution by recrystallization of some explosives in the printed samples.

Unlike approaches that focus only on elucidating mesoscopic mechanisms important to ignition, the present analysis seeks a methodology directly applicable to continuum explosive burn models. Because the Scaled Uniform Reactive Front (SURF) burn model has a microstructural basis, it is chosen as the starting point of the present analysis. To build upon the SURF framework, a literal translation is performed of the high-level conceptual notions for which SURF is based, to concrete ignition–combustion parameters, a statistical description of the microstructure, and other thermo-chemical data acquired by non-shock experiments. The analysis requires a void volume fraction distribution acquired from ultra-small angle neutron scattering (USANS). The shock response of PBX 9502 is used to illustrate the theory. While the analysis requires calibration to a shock experiment (the pop plot, for example), the results are a self-consistent set of realistic physical quantities that contribute to the shock initiation process including, initial temperature, chemical kinetics, a statistical description of the microstructure, and the hot spot size, spacing, and temperature. The utility of having a mesoscale based theory is that once the critical hot spot temperature, as a function of shock pressure, is known for a given explosive and initial porosity distribution, the entire set of meso- and macro-scale results, including the pop plot can be calculated for any other porosity. Thus, one can understand changes in sensitivity at different densities (void size distributions), relying only on the assumption that the hot spot temperature curve would not differ significantly if the morphology of the hots spots were similar. Another important utility of the present analysis is to address the question of the role of initial temperature on the observed shock sensitivity of PBX 9502 and other explosives. © 2017 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85037654107"

Two HE models are considered, broadly representing the properties of either a high- or low-detonation-speed HE, which permits studies of detonation propagating at speeds faster or slower than the confiner sound speed. The HE detonation is responsible for driving the compaction front in the confiner, while, in turn, the high material density generated in the confiner as a result of the compaction process can provide a strong confinement effect on the HE detonation structure. Polar solutions that describe the local flow interaction of the oblique HE detonation shock and equilibrium state behind an oblique compaction wave with rapid compaction relaxation rates are studied for varying initial solid volume fractions of the porous confiner. Multi-material numerical simulations are conducted to study the effect of detonation wave driven compaction in the porous confiner on both the detonation propagation speed and detonation driving zone structure. We perform a parametric study to establish how detonation confinement is influenced both by the initial solid volume fraction of the porous confiner and by the time scale of the dynamic compaction relaxation process relative to the detonation reaction time scale, for both the high- and low-detonation-speed HE models. The compaction relaxation time scale is found to have a significant influence on the confinement dynamics, with slower compaction relaxation time scales resulting in more strongly confined detonations and increased detonation speeds.

With the enhancement of water volume fractions, the intensity of emission band presents a step-by-step increase when fw = 0–70% in compound 1, where the maximum emission wavelength is 564 nm in the aggregated state and the peak area when fw = 90% is 5-fold more than that when fw = 0%. Furthermore, fluorescence titration results demonstate that this family of dibenzothiophene derivatives 1–3 is one of potential selective chemosensors for picric acid in aqueous phase and the obvious color change of the cellulose-based dibenzothiophene mixtures is illustrated with the addition of different explosives. In addition, theoretic computational studies on related luminogens have been carried out. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fabrication of cellulose-based dibenzothiophene composites exhibiting AIE properties for effective detection of explosives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85032963237"

Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising fluorescent sensors towards small molecules. Herein, we constructed an anionic Zn-based MOF FJI-C8 based on π-conjugated aromatic ligand H6TDPAT (2,4,6-tris(3,5-dicarboxylphenylamino)-1,3,5-triazine) containing nitrogen-rich sites. On account of the high density of uncoordinated N atoms, the high overlap between the emission spectrum of the anionic MOF FJI-C8 and the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the representative nitro explosive 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and the porosity of the MOF, FJI-C8 is demonstrated to be an excellent chemosensor for 2,4-DNP with fast response time (less than 30 s), high selectivity (Ksv = 5.11 × 104 M−1 for 2,4-DNP), extra sensitivity (LOD = 0.002866 mM for 2,4-DNP), low usage amount (0.04 mg/mL), good stability and quantitative detection features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example for highly selective detection of 2,4-DNP. More importantly, theoretical calculation and control experiments unveiled that the energy transfer is the main mechanism for highly detection of 2,4-DNP.

Firstly, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) were used to measure and analyze the reaction characteristics. Afterward the delay compositions of different formulas were processed to be cylindrical pellets and were characterized by measuring their burning properties including igniting ability, burning rate and output flame temperature. At last, the influence of each ingredient of the formula on the reaction characteristics and the burning properties were analyzed from the experimental data. The results showed that the thermal onset temperature of B/CuO mixture was significantly lower than that of B powder. The thermochemical characteristics of B powder could be improved by adding CuO powder. The B/CuO delay compositions were possessed of lower ignition energy, higher output flame temperature, and greater adjustability in burning rate. Furthermore, B powder only had low toxicity and CuO powder was generally regarded as being less toxic.

These NEBPs are not highly stable, and during aging, some of their functional characteristics may change, what can lead to serious safety problems. A thorough analytical characterization of NEBP is of fundamental importance to provide an adequate support for their stability and safe life assessment. Moreover, in order to safely store and fully exploit these energetic materials, accurate analytical techniques and strategies are indispensable to efficiently judge their properties during aging. Although various methodologies have been developed worldwide to evaluate the aging behavior of NEBP, the characterization is not a simple task and often involves the combination of several techniques, whose results have to be evaluated together.

This problem can be circumvented by using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), in which scattering signals increase significantly for analytes adsorbed onto or near nanostructured surfaces of the plasmonic materials. However, despite numerous studies, SERS has still not been widely used in real-world applications. The main goal of the studies describe herein was to investigate the possibility of detection of trace amounts of selected explosive materials on various commercial and non-commercial SERS substrates using portable Raman instruments. Our studies have shown that while portable systems suitable for SERS measurement of trace amounts of explosives are readily available, the problem remains in the selection of reliable and reproducible SERS substrates. Among five investigated SERS substrates only two, Klarite 312 and GaN-pillars allowed for trace analysis of all studied explosive materials. In both cases, detected concentrations of explosives ranged from single to hundreds of μg/cm2 depending on the explosive material and the Raman spectrometer used. Based on our findings, it could be concluded that the best SERS substrates for trace analysis of explosives are substrates with hot spots densely and evenly distributed over a whole active area of SERS substrate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85056892773"

In this paper, we report static measurement data of the permittivity for various reactive materials using the standard line transmission method between 75 GHz and 110 GHz (W frequency Band), and we present dynamic measurement results at 94 GHz obtained from the so-called detonation wavefront tracking method. It is shown that the measurement results provided by these two methods are in good agreement.

The simulations were carried out using ANSYS-AUTODYNE explicit solver. Fragment velocities were estimated as a function of different parametric combinations of explosive quantities, charge length to diameter ratio, fragment height to diameter ratio, confinement thickness, fragment material and fragment mass. The data was further converted to charge to metal ratio under fragment and confinement. It was observed that, increase in confinement thickness, charge quantity and decrease in fragment height increases the fragment velocity. It is also noted that, charge to metal mass ratio under fragment significantly affects the fragment velocity.

Monitoring the variation in microthermometer signal as a function of illuminating IR wavelength corresponds to the conventional IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, the mass of the adsorbed molecules is determined by measuring the resonance frequency shift of the cantilever shape microthermometer for the quantitative opto-calorimetric IR spectroscopy. In addition, micro-differential thermal analysis, which can be used to differentiate exothermic or endothermic reaction of heated molecules, has been performed with the same device to provide additional orthogonal signal for trace explosive detection and sensor surface regeneration. In summary, we have designed, fabricated and tested microcantilever shape devices integrated with a microthermometer/microheater which can provide electrical responses used to acquire both opto-calorimetric IR spectra and microcalorimetric thermal responses. We have demonstrated the successful detection, differentiation, and quantification of trace amounts of explosive molecules and their mixtures (cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) using three orthogonal sensing signals which improve chemical selectivity. © 2016 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84991509130"

An IR focal plane array is used to image the surface thermal emission upon laser illumination. The PT-IRIS signal is processed as a hyperspectral image cube comprised of spatial, spectral and temporal dimensions as vectors within a detection algorithm. Here we describe methods to increase both sensitivity to trace explosives and selectivity between different analyte types by exploiting a broader spectral range than in previous configurations.

Because the extremely high pressure oscillation occurs in less than a millisecond, an in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to observe the detailed flow structures and determine the adequate burning characteristics, including the burning rate. A hybrid RANS/LES scheme with a 5th order upwind weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) is implemented to capture complex, strong shock waves in highly turbulent combustion. A two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme tracks the combusting ZPP granules reasonably well. Monodisperse and Rosin-Rammler assumptions are applied to the ZPP granule distribution. The monodisperse assumption reveals that the diameter of the ZPP (17 μm) achieves marginal agreement with the measurements. However, the Rosin-Rammler distribution improves the transient and dynamic combustion characteristics in that the small granules contribute to a faster burning rate and stronger shock waves.

However, large light losses are inherent in the design due to sequential imaging at different wavelengths, leading to effective transmission often well below 1 %.

DMDs are based on mature microelectronics technology, and are compact, scalable, and can be customized for specific tasks, including new functions not available with current technologies. This paper has been focusing on investigating how a DMD can be used when applying CS-based imaging Raman spectroscopy on stand-off explosives trace detection, and evaluating the performance in terms of light throughput, image reconstruction ability and potential detection limits.

The consequences from a terrorist attack lead to critical economic infrastructure, public safety, and environment. Traditional intelligence gathering methods followed by government agencies and physical security systems at vulnerable facilities are not efficient for long-term implications. In this work, we propose a novel self-control solution using knowledge based decision making system (KBDMS) to detect explosives prior to attacks. The proposed system detects explosive materials using sensors, collects invader images (if any) by surveillance cameras, and forwards the information to a base station system (BSS) and/or a monitoring station to alert the emergency services. Adaptive media access control (A-MAC) protocol is used for the communication between the sensors. RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) algorithm that has digital signatory and integrity of log messages is used to enhance security. The collected information is analyzed at the monitoring station using face recognition techniques, situation reaction techniques, crime and intelligence analysis techniques, and threat severity estimation. The proposed system is evaluated using an Arduino simulator. Experimental results have shown the promise of this approach to defeat tragic attacks by detecting the explosives in prior. © 2017 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85019654203"

Restrictions on the carriage of LAGs remain today, and the operational impact of introducing further screening of liquids is subject to ongoing debate. This paper addresses one of the concerns, namely that the false alarm rates of liquid explosive detection systems (LEDS) are adversely affected by the filling level of LAGs containers. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the operational impact of screening partially full containers, based on a large number of screening repetitions under laboratory conditions and robust statistical analysis. False alarm rates were observed for 39 LAGs screened with 5 different LEDS. For each combination, four different container filling levels (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) were studied. These observations were used to model the impact of partially filling for sequential combinations of equipment. Three possible scenarios were considered, namely passengers being allowed to carry (1) only water, (2) water & soft drinks, and (3) all LAGs. The results show that, for a sequential combination of two equipment types, the impact of partially filled containers on the overall false alarm rate is negligible. Nevertheless, partially filled containers do result in an approximate two-fold increase in the number of items requiring level-two screening, which may be significant for airports when managing their screening processes. © 2017, The Auhtor(s).","2-s2.0-85032495299"

Given to the use of more powerful components such as flash powder recently, some firecrackers may cause massive life-threatening injuries in case of such misuse. Innocuous black powder firecrackers are subject to national explosives legislation and only have the potential to cause harmless injuries restricted to the soft tissue. We here report two cases of suicide committed by an intraoral placement of firecrackers, resulting in similar patterns of skull injury. As it was first unknown whether black powder firecrackers can potentially cause serious skull injury, we compared the potential of destruction using black powder and flash powder firecrackers in a standardized skull simulant model (Synbone, Malans, Switzerland). This was the first experiment to date simulating the impacts resulting from an intraoral burst in a skull simulant model. The intraoral burst of a “D-Böller” (an example of one of the most powerful black powder firecrackers in Germany) did not lead to any injuries of the osseous skull. In contrast, the “La Bomba” (an example of the weakest known flash powder firecrackers) caused complex fractures of both the viscero- and neurocranium. The results obtained from this experimental study indicate that black powder firecrackers are less likely to cause severe injuries as a consequence of intraoral explosions, whereas flash powder-based crackers may lead to massive life-threatening craniofacial destructions and potentially death. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-85018733975"

However, successful latent print recovery is not always possible from the crime scenes especially when the prints have been exposed to destructive conditions. Crime scenes are often despoiled due to destructive conditions such as arson, explosion, exposure to drainage water and soil or snow burial. Moreover, the offender often intends to destroy the fingerprint bearing crucial evidence, using these destructive forces. Furthermore, the fingerprints exposed to despoiled crime scenes are generally neglected due to the misconception of impossible recovery. In the present study, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based fluorescent small particle reagents were formulated, compared and evaluated for the development of latent prints exposed to destructive conditions. Fresh latent prints and prints exposed to natural or simulated destructive crime scene conditions, namely, arson, explosion, burial in soil, immersion in drainage water and burial in snow were developed using the three compositions. Latent prints were successfully recovered even from the destructive crime scene simulations. Better quality prints were obtained from fresh prints, arson, soil burial and drainage water. Relatively poor results were obtained from explosion and snow burial conditions.

One of the promising areas is laser remote detection of explosives. In this work we have developed a portable laser and quantitatively investigated its use for sampling of common explosives on different surfaces. It has been shown that most of desorbed products consist of molecules of explosives themselves, and the proportion of dissociated fragments is small. It is shown that laser irradiation increases the amount of desorbed matter not only by increasing the number of pulses, but also due to an additional warming of a substrate. The use of frequency mode smoothens peculiar properties of the desorption process for all explosives and substrates used. The typical desorbed amount ranges from 95 ng to 7900 ng for 10-second irradiation of the samples used. The developed laser can be applied in ion mobility spectrometry, IMS-based detectors of explosives to increase the distance of sampling.

The sensing mechanism and interaction between NDMI with PA is demonstrated via X-ray diffraction analysis, 1H NMR studies, cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible/fluorescence spectroscopy, and lifetime measurements. Single crystal X-ray structure of NDMI revealed the formation of self-assembled crystalline network assisted by noncovalent C-H···I interactions that get disrupted upon introducing PA as a result of anion exchange and strong π-π stacking between NDMI and PA.

As the first step, morphological and electrical properties of gold, palladium and silver non-continuous layers deposited on silver phthalocyanine (AgPc) have been studied. Experiments monitored by SEM confirmed formation of metal clusters on organic surface if subthreshold amount of metal is deposited onto the AgPc layer (i.e. layer of equivalent thickness of 4 nm for Pd, 5 nm for Au and 8 nm for Ag) and thermal stabilization follows. We demonstrated that metallic non-continuous layers on AgPc can be used for effective adjustment of chemiresistor's electrical resistance. Resistance of all modified sensors in reference atmosphere (synthetic air) − R0 − was effectively shifted by one to four orders of magnitude to lower values, so that cheaper devices and set-ups can be used for resistance measurements. Moreover, measurements of responses of Me/AgPc chemiresistors to 1 ppm of NO2 revealed that the presence of metal reduces the sensor response time (τ90). On basis of optimal R0 and τ90 values, Pd(1 nm)/AgPc chemiresistor was selected to be the most prospective for detection of taggants. Finally, the taggants were detected on Pd (1 nm)/AgPc chemiresistor in two modes: without- or with- photoactivation. While the dc-response (Sdc) to 190 ppm of non-activated 2-nitrotoluene vapors was negligible, on photoactivation we reached the value of Sdc = 5.8. This significant improvement, which is attributed to the formation of nitrogen dioxide during photoactivation of 2-nitrotoluene, and also negligible interaction of sensor with water vapor as the most common interferent make our method applicable for early detection of tagged explosives in real “field” conditions.

Existing methods are based primarily on the effects of blast overpressure on surrounding structures. Window breakage and structural damage are well studied and are widely used to derive most probable explosion strengths. Other explosive effects such as debris throw are usually left out of such forensic analyses. In this paper, a quantitative method is presented that can be used to obtain the explosion strength based on debris throw. When the method is applied together with analysis of other evidence at a post blast scene, more accurate predictions of the original amount of explosive can be obtained. An overview of the required information that has to be collected from a post-blast scene is outlined, which will aid in the backward calculations that will be carried out in the next stage. This calculation method is applied to two case studies, which illustrate that it is applicable to events involving both low and high order accidental explosion events. Besides accidents, the method is also applicable to intentional explosion scenarios such as terrorist attacks. It is shown that the added value of such a method to forensic investigation depends on the precision of the data collected. Therefore, it is recommended that first responders not only register the impact locations but also attempt to identify the part of the donor installation from which the debris originated. Furthermore, estimates should be made of the launch height and ballistic properties of the debris and information should be recorded on obstructions and terrain properties in the vicinity.

Inocula from diverse locations were tested for their ability to reduce nitrate and perchlorate in synthetic ion exchange spent brine (45 g/l NaCl) using H2-based MBfRs. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that proteobacterial species dominated the biofilm communities, particularly nitrate-reducing γ-proteobacteria. Even though the inocula to the MBfRs came from different sources, clones closely related to Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus represented 53% of all clones in the MBfR biofilms. The clone libraries contained no known perchlorate-reducing bacteria, which suggest that denitrifiers carried out perchlorate reduction, probably by secondary-utilization.","2-s2.0-76049084218"

Samples of the highly energetic materials (HEMs) 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were deposited on aluminum plates and detected at several source-target distances by carrying out remote infrared spectroscopy (RIRS) measurements on the aluminum substrates in active mode. The samples tested were placed at 1-30 m for the RIRS detection experiments. The effect of the angle of incidence/collection of the IR beams on the vibrational band intensities and the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) were investigated. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature. Surface concentrations from 50 to 400 μg/cm2 were studied. Partial least squares regression analysis was applied to the spectra obtained.

The photoacoustic signal, with frequencies predominantly between 100 and 500 kHz, is detected remotely via a wideband laser Doppler vibrometer. This two-laser system can be used to rapidly detect and discriminate explosives from ordinary background materials, which have significantly weaker photoacoustic response.

Current sensor technologies, although reasonably sized, are geared to more classical chemical threats, and the ability to expand their capabilities to a broader range of emerging threats is uncertain. Recently, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS), employed in a sensor format, has shown enormous potential to address these ever-changing threats. PAS is one of the more flexible IR spectroscopy variants, and that flexibility allows for the construction of sensors that are designed for specific tasks. PAS is well suited for trace detection of gaseous and condensed media. Recent research has employed quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) in combination with MEMS-scale photoacoustic cell designs. The continuous tuning capability of QCLs over a broad wavelength range in the mid-infrared spectral region greatly expands the number of compounds that can be identified. We will discuss our continuing evaluation of QCL technology as it matures in relation to our ultimate goal of a universal compact chemical sensor platform. Finally, expanding on our previously reported photoacoustic detection of condensed phase samples, we are investigating standoff photoacoustic chemical detection of these materials. We will discuss the evaluation of a PAS sensor that has been designed around increasing operator safety during detection and identification of explosive materials by performing sensing operations at a standoff distance.

This approach signals a departure from current use of databases and pulling of information technologies as well as allowing separation of concerns between how data are organised/structured and how data are manipulated/processed. Such an approach utilises an adaptive knowledge management platform capable of supporting organisational operations of LEAs using data aggregated from assorted, heterogeneous and online sources. Such knowledge is then pushed to the users, using recommenders, in an effortless manner addressing the needs of the organisation. Moreover, the system is designed to afford easier change of operational needs through the addition and removal of multiple folksonomies (representing changes in focus or new trends). These changes are further enriched with semantics providing specialised domain-specific content recommendations and semantically enriched search capabilities. This approach to knowledge retrieval has been applied to the domain of homemade explosives and counter-terrorism efforts as part of the HOMER project, where data are aggregated from sources such as police databases, online forums and explosives wikis. Data are stored in an unstructured manner and annotated by the users, ultimately being categorised as per the knowledge retrieval needs of the organisation, which in this case is to carry out efficient and effective investigations regarding homemade explosives.

As there is no reliable nano-colorimetric method for PETN assay, we developed an indirect method based on the determination of nitrite, obtained by reduction of nitrate derived from the alkaline hydrolysis of PETN with H2O2. We colorimetrically determined the final product, nitrite, by both conventional Griess reaction and a recently developed gold nanoparticle-4-aminothiophenol-N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine (AuNP−4-ATP+NED) method. Nitramines (RDX and HMX), if present, could be degraded by alkaline hydrolysis, without affecting PETN. The analytical performance characteristics of the developed assays as molar absorptivity (ε), limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were: ɛ=1.06×105 L mol−1 cm−1, LOD=0.03 mg L−1 and LOQ=0.11 mg L−1 for indirect Griess method; ɛ=1.9×104 L mol−1 cm−1; LOD=0.12 mg L−1 and LOQ=0.4 mg L−1 for AuNP−4-ATP+NED method. Both methods were applied to a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of PETN and TNT (corresponding to the composition of military explosive ‘Pentolite’). In order to eliminate the interference from TNT, the Meisenheimer anion of TNT formed in alkaline medium was retained on a strongly basic anion exchange resin column. As PETN had a very low solubility in water, common soil ions could be eliminated by prewashing the sample with water, or in acetone-water mixtures, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- could be tolerated at equal (1:1) mass ratios. Soil nitrates and nitrites, at a mass ratio of 50:1, could be separated from PETN with the aid of their insolubilities in acetone and of their retention affinity toward a strongly basic anion-exchange resin. The developed method was statistically validated against a reference GC-MS method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85025106989"

What is less well-known is the predictive relationship between particular dog behavioral traits (if any) and important working outcomes. Here we evaluate the validity of a dog behavioral test instrument given to military working dogs (MWDs) from the 341st Training Squadron, USA Department of Defense (DoD); the test instrument has been used historically to select dogs to be trained for deployment. A 15-item instrument was applied on three separate occasions prior to training in patrol and detection tasks, after which dogs were given patrol-only, detection-only, or dual-certification status. On average, inter-rater reliability for all 15 items was high (mean. = 0.77), but within this overall pattern, some behavioral items showed lower inter-rater reliability at some time points (<0.40). Test-retest reliability for most (but not all) single item behaviors was strong (>0.50) across shorter test intervals, but decreased with increasing test interval (<0.40). Principal components analysis revealed four underlying dimensions that summarized test behavior, termed here 'object focus', 'sharpness', 'human focus', and 'search focus'. These four aggregate behavioral traits also had the same pattern of short-, but not long-term test-retest reliability as that observed for single item behaviors. Prediction of certification outcomes using an independent test data set revealed that certification outcomes could not be predicted by breed, sex, or early test behaviors. However, prediction was improved by models that included two aggregate behavioral trait scores and three single item behaviors measured at the final test period, with 1 unit increases in these scores resulting in 1.7-2.8 increased odds of successful dual- and patrol-only certification outcomes. No improvements to odor-detection certification outcomes were made by any model. While only modest model improvements in prediction error were made by using behavioral parameters (2-7%), model predictions were based on data from dogs that had successfully completed all three test periods only, and therefore did not include data from dogs that were rejected during testing or training due to behavioral or medical reasons. Thus, future improvements to predictive models may be more substantial using independent predictors with less restrictions in range. Reports of the reliability and validity estimates of behavioral instruments currently used to select MWDs are scarce, and we discuss these results in terms of improving the efficiency by which working dog programs may select dogs for patrol and odor-detection duties using behavioral pre-screening instruments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-77957126840"

This work extends the method to imaging data collected at high resolution with a 18-40 GHz imaging system. The identification of explosives is accomplished by extracting the dielectric constant from the free-space, multifrequency data. The reflection coefficient is a function of frequency because of propagation effects associated with the material's complex dielectric constant, which include interference from multiple reflections and energy loss in the sample.

The research also addressed whether these samples were comprised of material from single or multiple geographical provenances that represented supply chain activity nodes. The simulation demonstrated that material derived from multiple activity nodes, was transferred and persisted on device components.

In the first implementation, an end-pumped Yb:YAG laser produced a 250μJ pulse train with an average power at 1030nm of 3.6W. Using a 10mm LBO crystal (70% doubling efficiency), followed by a 7mm BBO crystal (45% conversion efficiency), 1.1W at 257nm was generated (overall FHG efficiency of 30%). The second implementation was a side-pumped Q-switched Yb:YAG laser pumped by a 200W diode bar. A 10mm KTP crystal followed by a 6mm BBO crystal resulted a 15% FHG conversion efficiency. The UV emission was in a form of 1-5 Hz PRF, 2ms long burst of 0.2mJ pulses with a 30kHz intra-burst PRF. Within a 1.65ms emission window, an 11.5mJ burst at 257 nm was generated that had a maximum intra-burst power of 7W.

While explosion events like intentionally triggered bombs cause obvious harm to life and property, other explosions intended for benign purposes in quarries and construction zones may also cause unintended harm as a result of emanating seismic vibrations. As of today, detecting explosions, ranging them, and estimating their intensities are all accomplished only by seismometers that sense the associated ground vibrations and pressure changes as a result of their triggering. Unfortunately, seismometers are bulky, expensive and unsuitable for the ubiquitous use. In this paper, our broad motivation is to demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging the pervasive sensing and processing capabilities of modern smartphones to analyze explosion events. Within this context, we specifically address the problem of ranging and estimating the intensity of an explosion by leveraging the accelerometer and pressure sensors in the smartphone. To do so, we emplaced a number of smartphones in the vicinity of real explosion blasts conducted at a university mining laboratory, where the material blasted was Dynamite with Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO). We then collected the corresponding accelerometer and pressure readings sensed by the phone. We extracted a number of novel features, and designed a machine learning based algorithmic framework for ranging and estimating the intensity of the explosion event. After an extensive validation, we find that the average-case error in ranging (i.e., estimating the distance to the source of the explosion event) and estimating the intensity of explosive material (in terms of its charge weight) are 8.24% and 7.37%, respectively. We also present perspectives on encoding our algorithm as a smartphone app, identify several critical challenges that will be encountered in real-time data processing of smartphone accelerometers and pressure sensors in the context of pervasive sensing of explosions, and also identify other practical issues like the diversity of smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, our work is pioneering in demonstrating the feasibility of using smartphones to analyze explosion events.

Measurements of the output of explosives are commonly based upon the detonation parameters of the chemical energy content of the explosive. These quantities provide a correct understanding of the energy stored in an explosive, but they do not provide a direct measure of the different modes in which the energy is released. This optically based technique combines high-speed and ultra-high-speed imaging to characterize the casing fragmentation and the detonator-driven shock load. The procedure presented here could be used as an alternative to current indirect methods—such as the Trauzl lead block test—because of its simplicity, high data accuracy, and minimum demand for test repetition. This technique was applied to experimentally measure air shock expansion versus time and calculating the blast wave energy from the detonation of the high explosive charge inside the detonator. Direct measurements of the shock front geometry provide insight into the physics of the initiation buildup. Because of their geometry, standard detonators show an initial ellipsoidal shock expansion that degenerates into a final spherical wave. This non-uniform shape creates variable blast parameters along the primary blast wave. Additionally, optical measurements are validated using piezoelectric pressure transducers. The energy fraction spent in the acceleration of the metal shell is experimentally measured and correlated with the Gurney model, as well as to several empirical formulations for blasts from fragmenting munitions. The fragment area distribution is also studied using digital particle imaging analysis and correlated with the Mott distribution. Understanding the fragmentation distribution plays a critical role when performing hazard evaluation from these types of devices. In general, this technique allows for characterization of the detonator within 6–8% error with no knowledge of the amount or type of explosive contained within the shell, making it also suitable for the study of unknown improvised explosive devices. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-85014554400"

In this work, the thermal-mechanical response of cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) based granular explosives (GXs) and polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under impact loading has been investigated using finite element software ABAQUS. A series of three-dimensional mesoscale calculations is performed at impact velocities from 100 m/s to 500 m/s using a crystal plasticity constitutive model for HMX crystals that accounts for nonlinear, anisotropic thermoelasticity and for crystal plasticity. For PBX simulations, a viscoelasticity model is used for the polymer binder. Results show that the average and localized stress and temperature field, which are greatly affected by crystal anisotropy and polymer binder, of GXs are larger than those of PBXs.

A readily accessible brand of exploding targets called Tannerite® has been identified as a potential material for abuse as an explosive in pipe bombs. The ability to recover and genotype DNA from such weapons may be vital in the effort to identify suspects associated with these devices. While it is possible to recover DNA from post-blast fragments using short tandem repeat markers (STRs), genotyping success can be negatively affected by low quantities of DNA, degradation, and/or PCR inhibitors. Alternative markers such as insertion/null (INNULs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are bi-allelic genetic markers that are shorter genomic targets than STRs for amplification, which are more likely to resist degradation. In this study, we constructed pipe bombs that were spiked with known amounts of biological material to: 1) recover “touch” DNA from the surface of the device, and 2) recover traces of blood from the ends of wires (simulated finger prick). The bombs were detonated with the binary explosive Tannerite® using double-base smokeless powder to initiate the reaction. DNA extracted from the post-blast fragments was quantified with the Quantifiler® Trio DNA Quantification Kit. STR analysis was conducted using the GlobalFiler® Amplification Kit, INNULs were amplified using an early-access version of the InnoTyper™ 21 Kit, and SNP analysis via massively parallel sequencing (MPS) was performed using the HID-Ion Ampliseq™ Identity and Ancestry panels using the Ion Chef and Ion PGM sequencing system. The results of this study showed that INNUL markers resulted in the most complete genetic profiles when compared to STR and SNP profiles. The random match probabilities calculated for samples using INNULs were lower than with STRs when less than 14 STR alleles were reported. These results suggest that INNUL analysis may be well suited for low-template and/or degraded DNA samples, and may be used to supplement incomplete or failed STR analysis. Human identification using SNP analysis via MPS showed variable success with low-level post-blast samples in this study (<150 pg). While neat DNA samples (6 μL input as recommended) resulted in <50% of SNP calls, samples that were concentrated from 15 μL to 6 μL (15 μL was added for STR and INNUL typing) resulted in more complete SNP profiles. Five out of six blood samples recovered from the wires attached to the pipe-bombs resulted in the correct ancestry predictions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85014941801"

There are few universally accepted methods to achieve this end. This project aims to explore this issue through the examination of the spatial distribution of the tissue fragments resulting from an explosive event. To address this, a two stage pilot study was conducted: first, a series of controlled explosions on porcine carcases was undertaken. Second, the data produced from these explosions were used to chart the spatial distribution of the tissue debris. In the controlled explosions, 3 kg military grade explosive was chosen to create the maximum amount of fragmentation; this level of explosive also prevented the complete disappearance of forensic evidence through evaporation. Additionally, the blast created by military grade explosive is highly powerful and would mean that the maximum possible distance was achieved and would therefore allow the recorded distances and pattern spread to be a guideline for forensic recovery of associated with an explosive amount of an unknown size and quality. A total station was employed to record the location of the resulting forensic evidence, with the collected data analysed using R Studio. The observed patterns suggested that the distribution of remains is fairly consistent in trials under similar environmental conditions.

To give a theoretical description of laser propagation in energy-saturated photosensitive composites as in diffuse scattering media with close packed scatterers. Methodology. Analysis and generalization of theoretical research. The Monte Carlo method of direct statistical modeling has been applied. A computational study of the process of scattering of photons in photosensitive energysaturated composites has been carried out, the results of the computational study have been analyzed. Findings. The results of computation of the illuminance for diffuse scattering media (DSM) by the Monte Carlo method have been presented. In particular, it has been determined that the initiation of highly sensitive explosives and photosensitive composites can not be explained based on the concepts of a multiple increase in volumetric illumination within a diffuse scattering medium with respect to the surface one, since such an increase is unfeasible. However, the light regime in a diffuse scattering medium is one of the determining factors for the ignition of explosives by laser radiation. Originality. The diffuse reflection factor of DSM mainly depends on the photon survival rate and the refraction index. For each DSM there is a limiting value of the laser beam radius beginning with which the spatial illuminance does not change with the increase in the laser beam radius r. It is shown that with the increase in the bunch concentration in samples of photosensitive explosives (VS), the depth of the material layer with high values of illuminance increases. Moreover, the growth rate is inversely proportional to the beam radius. This regularity is well correlated with observed experimental dependence of VS sensitivity on the bunch concentration. Thus, in case of initiation of substance of VS2 grade with a 1.5 mm diameter laser beam, the sensitivity increased approximately by a factor of 2 with an increase in the bunch concentration from 10 to 20-30 %, while for a 4.5 mm diameter beam the sensitivity growth was ∼ 13 %. Practical value. The results of theoretical research were used when making laboratory samples of the optical detonator and during the research on actuation of optical detonators depending on the energetic and geometric characteristics of the laser beam. © Sobolev V.

One major task includes the development of new methods and sensor systems for the detection. Many existing remote or standoff methods like infrared or raman spectroscopy find their limits, if the hazardous material is concealed in an object. Imaging technologies using x-ray or terahertz radiation usually yield no information about the chemical content itself. However, the exact knowledge of the real threat potential of a suspicious object is crucial for disarming the device. A new approach deals with a laser drilling and sampling system for the use as verification detector for suspicious objects. Central part of the system is a miniaturised, diode pumped Nd:YAG laser oscillator-amplifier. The system allows drilling into most materials like metals, synthetics or textiles with bore hole diameters in the micron scale. During the drilling process, the hazardous material can be sampled for further investigation with suitable detection methods. In the reported work, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is used to monitor the drilling process and to classify the drilled material.

The measurement of toxicity reduction of aqueous solutions containing TNT and RDX was performed using a novel methodology developed for use with the Microtox® testing system. Radiolabeled TNT and RDX were used to confirm removal of explosives from hydroponic solutions containing plant tissue cultures and to verify that toxicity did not change in solutions where no plant cultures were present (positive controls). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) measurements confirmed removal of TNT and RDX from solutions containing poplar plant tissue cultures and constancy of the plant-free controls.

This is based on the rapid redox reaction of peroxides (hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, triacetone triperoxide and H2O2) with bromide at 55 °C. Consumption of bromide is indicative of the reduction of the R-O-O-R moiety, the appearance of Br2 was found for all except for triacetone triperoxide. The latter was found to breakdown to acetone which rapidly reacts with Br2 producing bromoacetones. The lack of Br2 production is unique to triacetone triperoxide. Double step chronoamperometry (E1 = 700 mV, E2 = 960 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl)) allows for the quantitation of bromine (Br2 + 2e- → 2Br-) and bromide (2Br- → Br2 + 2e-) respectively. The results yielded a detection limit of 8.5 μM for triacetone triperoxide with a sensitivity of 0.026 μA μM- 1.

The Lagrangian-Eulerian coupling algorithm, the equations of state for explosives and seawater, and the simple calculation method for explosive loading were also reviewed.

Industrial applications include wastewaters from oil refineries, chemical factories, pulp and paper production, tannery and textile industries, abattoir, distillery and winery industries. In particular, the use of HF CWs is becoming very common for treatment of food-processing wastewaters (e.g., production and processing of milk, cheese, potatoes, sugar). HF constructed wetlands are also successfully used to treat wastewaters from agriculture (e.g., pig and dairy farms, fish farm effluents) and various runoff waters (agriculture, airports, highway, greenhouses, plant nurseries).

Objectives: We used hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), a common environmental contaminant, as a toxicant stressor to investigate toxicant-induced changes in miRNA expression in B6C3F1 mice and the potential mechanism of RDX-induced toxic action. Methods: B6C3F1 mice were fed diets with or without 5 mg/kg RDX for 28 days. After the feeding trials, we isolated RNAs from both brain and liver tissues and analyzed the expression profiles of 567 known mouse miRNAs using microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technologies. Results: RDX exposure induced significant changes in miRNA expression profiles. A total of 113 miRNAs, belonging to 75 families, showed significantly altered expression patterns after RDX exposure. Of the 113 miRNAs, 10 were significantly up-regulated and 3 were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.01) in both mouse brain and liver. Many miRNAs had tissue-specific responses to RDX exposure. Specifically, expression of seven miRNAs was up-regulated in the brain but down-regulated in the liver or up-regulated in the liver but down-regulated in the brain (p < 0.01). Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers, toxicant-metabolizing enzymes, and neurotoxicity. We found a significant up-regulation of oncogenic miRNAs and a significant down-regulation of tumor-suppressing miRNAs, which included let-7, miR-17-92, miR-10b, miR-15, miR-16, miR-26, and miR-181.

The traditional methods employ a soil-dilution extraction of the sample prior to analysis by high performance liquid chromatography with UV absorption detection. Another concern with the traditional analysis is that energetics contamination in environmental samples is often very heterogeneous in nature, usually requiring a large number of samples and multiple testing. The technique presented here addresses these data quality limitations by using a concentrative extraction procedure which produces a small volume of extract from a large soil sample. A concentration factor of 60-fold is achieved in this manner and energetics detection limits for soils are lowered by two orders of magnitude. The larger soil sample size also helps reduce the error associated with sample heterogeneity.

The batch-wise experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating variables on the electrolytic behavior, including electrode potential, oxygen dosage, electrolytic temperature, acidity of wastewater and dosage of ferrous ions. It deserves to note that the nitrotoluenes contained could be completely decomposed by Electro-Fenton's reagents, wherein hydrogen peroxide was in situ generated from cathodic reduction of oxygen, supplied mainly by anodic oxidation of water. During the electrochemical process, the influence of electrolytic temperature on the degradation of nitrotoluenes is the most significant, followed by electrode potential, acidity of wastewater and oxygen dosage. Based on the spectra analyzed by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), it is proposed that initial denitration of 2,4-DNT and/or 2,6-DNT gives rise to formation of o-mononitrotoluene, which undergoes the cleavage of nitro group into toluene, followed by oxidation of methyl group to benzoic acid and subsequent decarboxylation.

Biodegradation of RDX or HMX alone was markedly faster than their degradation in a mixture with TNT, implying biodegradation inhibition by the latter. The delay caused by the presence of TNT continued even after its disappearance and was linked to the presence of its intermediate, tetranitroazoxytoluene. PCR-DGGE analysis of cultures derived from the soil indicated a clear reduction in microbial biomass and diversity with increasing TNT concentration. At high-TNT concentrations (30 and 90 mg/L), only a single band, related to Clostridium nitrophenolicum, was observed after 3 days of incubation. We propose that the mechanism of TNT inhibition involves a cytotoxic effect on the RDX- and HMX-degrading microbial population.

Two kinds of OEG containing amine compounds, where H2N(C2H4O)11C2H4NHCOOC(CH3)3 served as a linker to react with carboxyl groups of TNT analogues while H2N(C2H4O)3C2H4OH served as a protein non-fouling background, were covalently bound to carboxyl terminal groups of SAMs with a certain ratio. Optimal ratio of them was also examined. Three kinds of TNT analogues, namely TNP-glycine, DNP-glycine, and DNP-acetic acid were used as immobilized ligands. Highly sensitive TNT detection by indirect competitive assay was conducted on the fabricated sensor surfaces; we examined how structural variations of them affect sensitivity in order to choose optimal hapten as well to improve sensitivity.

The improvised explosive device (IED) has been widely used by the insurgents and is the leading cause of death and injury among Coalition troops in the region. METHOD:: From January 2006, data were prospectively collected on 100 consecutive casualties who were either injured or killed in hostile action. Mechanism of injury, new Injury Severity Score (NISS), The International Classification of Disease-9th edition diagnosis, anatomic pattern of wounding, and operative management were recorded in a trauma registry. The weapon incident reports were analyzed to ascertain the type of IED employed. RESULTS:: Of the 100 casualties injured in hostile action, 53 casualties were injured by IEDs in 23 incidents (mean 2.3 casualties per incident). Twenty-one of 23 (91.3%) of the IEDs employed were explosive formed projectile (EFP) type. Twelve casualties (22.6%) were either killed or died of wounds. Median NISS score of survivors was 3 (range, 1-50). All fatalities sustained unsurvivable injuries with a NISS score of 75. Primary blast injuries were seen in only 2 (3.8%) and thermal injuries in 8 casualties (15.1%). Twenty (48.7%) of survivors underwent surgery by British surgeons in the field hospital. At 18 months follow, all but one of the United Kingdom Service personnel had returned to military employment. CONCLUSIONS:: The injury profile seen with EFP-IEDs does not follow the traditional pattern of injuries seen with conventional high explosives. Primary blast injuries were uncommon despite all casualties being in close proximity to the explosion. When the EFP-IED is detonated, the EFP produced results in catastrophic injuries to casualties caught in its path, but causes relatively minor injuries to personnel sited adjacent to its trajectory. Improvements in vehicle protection may prevent the EFP from entering the passenger compartments and thereby reduce fatalities. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","2-s2.0-67650609137"

The isolate grew optimally at 30 °C and initial pH 7.0-7.5 in the mineral salts medium supplemented with picric acid. It was basically consistent with degradation of picric acid by the isolate.

Re-introduction of such variants in P. putida settled the transcriptional activity of the cognate promoters (Po and Pu) as a function of the presence of nitrotoluenes in the medium.When strains bearing transcriptional fusions to reporters with an optical output (luxAB, GFP) were spread on soil spotted with nitrotoluenes, the signal triggered by promoter activation allowed localization of the target compounds on the soil surface.

On the other hand, the genes responsible for anaerobic RDX mineralization pathways remain unknown. To determine the unique genomic properties of bacteria responsible for both cold-adaptation and RDX degradation, the genomes of S. halifaxensis and S. sediminis were sequenced and compared with 108 other γ-proteobacteria including Shewanella that differ in temperature and Na+ requirements, as well as RDX degradation capability. Results showed that for coping with marine environments their genomes had extensively exchanged with deep sea bacterial genomes. Many genes for Na+-dependent nutrient transporters were recruited to use the high Na+ content as an energy source. For coping with low temperatures, these two strains as well as other psychrophilic strains of Shewanella and γ-proteobacteria were found to decrease their genome G+C content and proteome alanine, proline and arginine content (p-value <0.01) to increase protein structural flexibility.

Five river water samples and 18.2 MΩ deionized water were spiked with 10 explosives compounds and the samples were held at ambient temperatures (20 °C) for 85 d. Surface water represented three rivers with a range of total organic carbon concentrations and two rivers draining glacial watersheds with minimal organic carbon but high suspended solids. 18.2 MΩ deionized water exhibited no explosives transformation. Nitroaromatic compound loss from solution was generally: tetryl > 1,3,5-TNB > TNT > 1,3-DNB > 2,4-DNT. The HMX, RDX, 2,6-DNT, 2ADNT, and 4ADNT concentrations remained somewhat stable over time. The surface water with the highest total organic carbon concentration exhibited the most dramatic nitroaromatic loss from solution with tetryl, 1,3,5-TNB and TNT concentrations decreasing to below detection within 10 d. The two water samples with high suspended solid loads exhibited substantial nitroaromatic explosives loss which could be attributable to adsorption onto fresh mineral surfaces and/or enhanced microbiologic biotransformation on mineral surfaces. An identical set of six water samples was spiked with explosives and acidified with sodium bisulfate to a pH of 2. Acidification maintained stable explosives concentrations in most of the water samples for the entire 85 d. Our results suggest sampling campaigns for explosives in surface water must account for biogeochemical characteristics. Acidification of samples with sodium bisulfate immediately following collection is a robust way to preserve nitroaromatic compound concentrations even at ambient temperature for up to three months.","2-s2.0-67349142168"

Questions have been raised as how to prepare representative analytical samples for metals determination from field composites. Three different grinding procedures were used in this study for three soil types to determine if grinding (relative to homogenizing soil without grinding) increases metal concentrations and decreases variability. The performance of these procedures was demonstrated via the analysis of replicates (n = 16 for two soil types) using statistical evaluations that included calculations of various descriptive statistics (e.g., medians, means and standard deviations), Kruskal-Wallis (KW) tests for the medians and two tests for the variances (Bartlett's and Levene's test). There was a slight increase in concentrations for several of the metals in the clay loam soil after grinding, although the increases were a small percentage of the concentrations measured. The standard deviations (and variances) for replicate digestions and analyses generally decreased, although anomalies were observed.

Explosive molecule chemistry within trace detection techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is an area of intense interest because of the widespread deployment of IMS-based explosive detectors for counterterrorism efforts. As in IMS, the DESI-MS experiments analyze material that starts in the solid phase and is detected in the gas phase. Using the unique chemical characterization inherent in mass spectrometry, information pertinent to the atmospheric ionization of RDX is obtained in order to help explain the behavior of explosive molecule signatures observed within IMS experiments. Qualitative and quantitative information was obtained over 3 orders of magnitude of deposited mass (nanograms to greater than micrograms). A method was developed to use the relative integrated mass spectral peak intensities of RDX monomer and dimer chloride adducts to determine the amount of explosive present on a surface. The ratio of RDX dimer chloride adduct to monomer chloride adduct ranged from 0.1 for 15 ng to 1.0 for 1.5 μg of deposited explosive. The results are explained in terms of mechanisms reported in the literature for electrospray ionization (ESI), as well as by simple solution dynamics and the interaction chemistry between RDX molecules. On the basis of all available data, the RDX dimer chloride adduct becomes disproportionately favored over the monomer chloride adduct at larger amounts of explosive because of effects related to desorbed droplet charge, solvent declustering, and the strong intermolecular forces between RDX molecules in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Additionally, considerations for optimization of the DESI-MS process are described in order to increase the practicality for this technique as an explosives detection tool in the public domain.","2-s2.0-67649961439"

Upon anodic potential scanning, HMTD irreversibly oxidized at ∼1.70 V vs Ag/Ag+ (10 mM) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, and the ECL profile was coincident with the oxidation potential of HMTD in the presence of ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) (Ru(bpy)32+) luminophore species, which showed a half-wave potential of 0.96 V vs Ag/Ag+. The addition of small amounts of AgNO3 (0.50-7.0 mM) into the HMTD/Ru(bpy)32+ system resulted in significant enhancement in HMTD ECL production (up to 27 times). This enhancement was determined to be largely associated with NO3- and was linearly proportional to the concentrations of NO3- and Ag+ in solution. Homogeneous chemical oxidations of HMTD by electrogenerated NO 3• and Ag(II) species proximity to the electrode were proposed to be responsible for the ECL enhancement. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and CV digital simulations, standard potential values of 1.79 V vs Ag/Ag+ (or 1.98 V vs NHE) and 1.82 V vs Ag/Ag+ (or 2.01 V vs NHE) were estimated for Ag(II)/Ag(I) and NO3 •/NO3- couples, respectively.

Biodegradation was proposed as a natural attenuating remediation method for the contaminated aquifer. By isotope analysis of RDX, the extent of biodegradation was found to reach up to 99.5% of the initial mass at a distance of 1.15-1.35 km down gradient from the contamination sources. A range of first-order biodegradation rates was calculated based on the degradation extents, with average half-life values ranging between 4.4 and 12.8 years for RDX biodegradation in the upper 15 m of the aquifer, assuming purely aerobic biodegradation, and between 10.9 and 31.2 years, assuming purely anaerobic biodegradation. Based on the geochemical data, an aerobic biodegradation pathway was suggested as the dominant attenuation process at the site. The calculated biodegradation rate was correlated with depth, showing decreasing degradation rates in deeper groundwater layers. Exceptionally low first-order kinetic constants were found in a borehole penetrating the bottom of the aquifer, with half life ranging between 85.0 to 161.5 years, assuming purely aerobic biodegradation, and between 207.5 and 394.3 years, assuming purely anaerobic biodegradation. The study showed that stable isotope fractionation analysis is a suitable tool to detect biodegradation of RDX in the environment. Our findings clearly indicated that RDX is naturally biodegraded in the contaminated aquifer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of RDX isotope analysis to quantify its biodegradation in contaminated aquifers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two past research efforts have demonstrated this utility and are described here. A 4.5 m vertical core was obtained from a diesel fuel oil contamination plume. Core material was assayed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and bacterial membrane phospholipids (PLFA) via a single solvent extraction. Microbial viable biomass and the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacterial PLFA biomarkers were found to be significantly correlated with TPH concentration. The core TPH profile also revealed two distinct areas where the average TPH level of 3000 μg g- 1 fell to near detection limits. Both areas were characterized by a three-fold decrease in the hexadecane/pristane ratio, indicating alkane biodegradation, and a distinct PLFA profile that showed a close similarity to the uncontaminated surface soil. Low-order, incomplete detonations can deposit hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) into training range surface soils. Since surface soils are exposed to temporal and diurnal moisture cycles, we investigated the effect two very different soil moisture tensions had on the in situ microbiota and RDX biodegradation. Saturated soils were characterized by rapid RDX biodegradation, 4 day half-life, a decrease in number of species detected and increase in PLFA biomarkers for Gram-negative proteobacteria (n16:1ω7c, n18:1ω9c, and n18:1ω7c) and Gram-positive firmicutes (i15:0 and a15:0). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of endpoint microbial communities indicated a shift from 18 to 36% firmicutes, the loss of gamma-proteobacteria and the emergence of alpha-proteobacteria. These two past research efforts demonstrated the utility of the lipid biomarker analysis in identifying microbial community characteristics that were associated with two very different soil contaminants. Lipid biomarkers defined areas of TPH biodegradation and identified community shifts as a result of soil conditions that affected explosives fate.

The dependence of ionic intensity on reduced-field in the drift tube was investigated, and the results indicate that an irregular operation using low reduced-field can enhance TATP detection due to reduced collision-induced dissociation in the drift tube. When water vapor is used as the discharge gas, the characteristic ions for TATP identification are [TATP + H]+ which are detectable at a reduced-field about 50 Td. If ammonia is the discharge gas, PTR-MS exhibits a better sensitivity, the explosive TATP can be discriminated according to the adduct ions [TATP + NH4]+, and a limit of detection at ppb level can be achieved at a reduced-field around 100 Td in this PTR-MS apparatus.

To assess if these poly-nitroaromatic compounds (P-NACs) are being degraded in the subsurface, tracer-based groundwater dating techniques combined with compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) were applied. The groundwater residence times were distinctly different in the two aerobic aquifers, as determined by the tritium (3H)-3He method. In the contaminated zones, the upper aquifer exhibited groundwater ages of 25 years, whereas the lower (presumably confined) aquifer contained hardly any tritium which indicates water ages >55 years. P-NACs-containing waste waters are known to have leaked into the upper, unconfined aquifer. However, P-NACs were present in both aquifers in high concentrations (up to 33 000 μg L-1 TNT), which implies a hydraulic connection, although tritium concentrations and chemical data suggest two separated aquifers. Based on the 3H-3He groundwater dating and the presence of very high P-NAC concentrations, the contamination of the lower aquifer must have happened during the early stage of the explosive production, i.e. >50 years ago. Despite this 'old' contamination, TNT and DNT have not been transformed until to date as is demonstrated by the negligible changes in their carbon isotopic signatures (δ13C). Thus, P-NACs are very recalcitrant to degradation at the investigated site. If the aquifers remain aerobic, TNT and DNT are expected to persist in the subsurface for many decades to centuries. The presented approach of assessing time scales of natural attenuation at the field scale by the combination of CSIA and 3H-3He water dating has the potential to be applied to any other groundwater contaminants, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, gasoline components, heterocyclic carbenes, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased vigilance regarding security to protect against terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction, including especially explosive devices, as well as an increased interest in the comparison to the explosive detection capabilities of instrumental technologies, has however led to increased scrutiny of canine explosive detection capabilities. Despite recent increased interest in canine olfactory and applied EDD research, there is still a lack of a complete and robust scientific model of the way dogs actually detect substances, although considerable progress has been made. For explosives, there are three possible types of signatures a dog can key on, which include the explosive itself; a contaminant or minor constituent of the explosive common to most batches of that explosive; and a decomposition product of that explosive. Although there is enough evidence to conservatively suggest that dogs clearly possess sufficient potential olfactory sensitivity for explosive detection tasks, a more practical concern is related to operational sensitivity, which depends strongly on how the dogs are trained. In the United States, the use of food reward was supported by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and in the late 1990s the ATF issued guidelines for proficiency testing known as the National Odor Recognition Test (NORT) where the dog has to recognize six explosives in 100 g quantities, which include black powder (free flowing or in safety fuse), double-base smokeless powder, dynamite (containing NG and EGDN), PETN, RDX, and TNT. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As an example, solidphase extracts of two groundwater samples taken from a former ammunition destruction site in Switzerland were investigated. 1H NMR spectra of postcolumn SPE enriched compounds, together with accurate mass measurements, allowed the structural elucidation of unknowns. This untargeted approach allowed us to identify expected residues of explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (2,4,6-TNT), Hexogen (RDX) and Octogen (HMX), degradation products of TNT (1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (1,3,5-TNB), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-A-4,6-DNT), 3,5-dinitrophenol (3,5-DNP), 3,5-dinitroaniline (3,5-DNA), 2,6-dinitroanthranile, and 2-Hydroxy-4,6- dinitrobenzonitrile), benzoic acid, Bisphenol A (a known endocrine disruptor compound), and some toxicologically relevant additives for propelling charges: Centralite I (1,3-diethyl-1,3-diphenylurea), DPU (N,N-diphenylurethane), N,N-diphenylcarbamate (Acardite II), and N-methyl-N-phenylurethane. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of these additives in environmental samples. Extraction recoveries for Centralite I and DPU have been determined.

It was also used in the first World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993. It is difficult to identify urea nitrate in post-explosion debris, since only a very small fraction survives the blast. Also, in the presence of water, it readily decomposes to its original components, urea and nitric acid. It is suspected that post-blast debris of urea nitrate can be confused with ammonium nitrate, the main solid product of urea nitrate thermal decomposition. In a comprehensive study towards identification of urea nitrate in post-blast traces, a spectrophotometric technique for quantitative determination of urea nitrate was developed, and conditions were found for extraction and separation of un-exploded traces of urea nitrate with minimal decomposition. Nevertheless, out of 28 samples collected from a series of three controlled firings of urea nitrate charges, only one gave the typical adduct ion by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We found that urea nitrate can be extracted from solid mixtures to organic solvents by using Crown ethers as ""host compounds."" The adducts thus formed are solid, crystalline compounds that can be characterized by microanalysis and spectroscopic techniques. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-68949200814"

Insects have evolved over millions of years to detect and maneuver toward a food source or mate, or away from predators. The insect olfactory system is able to identify volatiles on a time scale that matches their ability to maneuver. Here, biological olfactory sense organs, insect antennae, have been exploited in a hybrid-device biosensor, demonstrating the ability to identify individual strands of odor in a plume passing over the sensor on a sub-second time scale. A portable system was designed to utilize the electrophysiological responses recorded from a sensor array composed of male or female antennae from four or eight different species of insects (a multi-channel electroantennogram, EAG). A computational analysis strategy that allows discrimination between odors in real time is described in detail. Following a training period, both semi-parametric and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers with the ability to discard ambiguous responses are applied toward the classification of up to eight odors. EAG responses to individual strands in an odor plume are classified or discarded as ambiguous with a delay (sensor response to classification report) on the order of 1 s. The dependence of classification error rate on several parameters is described. Finally, the performance of the approach is compared to that of a minimal conditional risk classifier. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-58149504740"

The remarkable selectivity of the PB-based screen-printed electrode towards hydrogen peroxide leads to effective discrimination against common beverage samples.

Propellants contain energetic compounds such as nitroglycerin (NG) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), both of which are found at firing positions and propellant disposal areas. To quantify the mass of residue remaining from the field-expedient disposal of propellants, two mortar propellants and one howitzer propellant were burned under different field conditions. These conditions included burning on a snow pack, at the bottom of a snow pit, and in a pan surrounded by snow for the mortar propellants and on dry and wet sand for the howitzer propellant. For the mortar propellant, the energetics (NG) remaining after burning in the bowl, on frozen ground, and on snow were 0.21%, 5.2% and 18%, respectively. For the howitzer propellant, the difference in energetics (2,4-DNT) remaining after disposal on wet and dry sand was <0.1%, with the overall residue rate of around 1%, similar to that for the mortar propellant burned in an open container.

In the presence of SC-20, highly reducing conditions were generated, supporting both denitrification and sulfate reduction of aerated water. Rapid degradation of protein in SC-20 was observed to cause an initial high release of ammonium and carbon, while a slower, continuous release of calcium carbonate from the crab shell maintained the pH near 9 throughout the tests. In batch tests, denitrification rates of 2.4 ± 0.2 mg N/L-d were obtained. Columns receiving a continuous nitrate load of 24.5 mg N/L-d sustained complete denitrification for an average of 149 d (250 pore volumes). The denitrification rates and longevity of SC-20 chitin are comparable to, or better than, those previously reported for other polymeric substrates. This, in addition to its particle size, non-swelling nature, and ease of delivery in slurry form make SC-20 an attractive electron donor source for groundwater bio-denitrification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilizing phage display techniques against trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) targets, peptide receptors have previously been identified with selective binding capabilities for these molecules. For practical applications, these receptors must be immobilized onto the surface of sensor platforms at high density while maintaining their ability to bind target molecules. In this paper, a polymeric matrix composed of poly(ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PEGM) has been prepared. A high density of receptors was covalently linked through reaction of amino groups present in the receptor with epoxy groups present in the co-polymer. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas-chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), this attachment strategy is demonstrated to lead to stably bound receptors, which maintain their selective binding ability for TNT. The TNT receptor/PEGM conjugates retained 10-fold higher TNT binding ability in liquid compared to the lone PEGM surface and 3-fold higher TNT binding compared to non-specific receptor conjugates. In contrast, non-target DNT exposure yielded undetectable levels of binding. These results indicate that this polymeric construct is an effective means of facilitating selective target interaction both in an aqueous environment. Finally, real-time detection experiments were performed using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as the sensing platform. Selective detection of TNT vs DNT was demonstrated using QCM crystals coated with PEGM/TNT receptor, highlighting that this receptor coating can be incorporated as a sensing element in a standard detection device for practical applications. © 2009 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-66349096875"

The batch-wise experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the sonolytic behavior, including power intensity, acidity of wastewater, reaction temperature and oxygen dosage. It is remarkable that the nitrotoluenes contained could be almost completely decomposed by the sonochemical oxidation method, wherein the pyrolytic reaction was responsible for the destruction of organic compounds. During the sonication tests, the influence of reaction temperature on the degradation of nitrotoluenes is the most significant, followed by power intensity, acidity of wastewater and oxygen dosage. Based on the spectra obtained from gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), it is suggested that 2,4,6-TNT is preliminarily denitrated to 2,6-DNT. The denitration of 2,6-DNT and/or 2,4-DNT results in the formation of o-mononitrotoluene, which proceeds with the cleavage of nitro group into toluene, followed by oxidation of methyl group and decarboxylation. In this study, it is believed that the sonolytic technique established is promising for wastewater disposal in toluene nitration processes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this research is to characterize and help understand soil development within areas disturbed by explosive munitions on the WWI battlefield of Verdun, France (1916). Encompassing an area of 29,000 km2, the battlefield remains one of the most heavily shelled of all time. Twenty-seven pedons were sampled and described, at three sites on the battlefield; some pedons were within artillery craters while others were on adjacent ""undisturbed"" soils. Site selection reflected the diversity of bedrock and drainage characteristics across the study area. Soil development was characterized within the crater bottoms and sides. Many craters penetrated the shallow limestone bedrock, and blasted out fragments of limestone on nearby undisturbed pedons had already been incorporated into the profile. Despite the short period of time since the battle (88 years), measurable amounts of weathering and pedogenesis has occurred in the soils within the craters. A major pedogenic process operative here is the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter, which is intimately associated with (and aided by) earthworm bioturbation.

Diverse methods are reported to remove nitrate from water streams which almost fail to entirely treat nitrate, except biological denitrification which is capable of reducing inorganic nitrate compounds to harmless nitrogen gas. Review of numerous studies in biological denitrification of nitrate containing water resources, aquaculture wastewaters and industrial wastewater confirmed the potential of this method and its flexibility towards the remediation of different concentrations of nitrate. The denitrifiers could be fed with organic and inorganic substrates which have different performances and subsequent advantages or disadvantages. Review of heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifications with different food and energy sources concluded that autotrophic denitrifiers are more effective in denitrification. Autotrophs utilize carbon dioxide and hydrogen as the source of carbon substrate and electron donors, respectively. The application of this method in bio-electro reactors (BERs) has many advantages and is promising. However, this method is not so well established and documented. BERs provide proper environment for simultaneous hydrogen production on cathodes and appropriate consumption by immobilized autotrophs on these cathodes. This survey covers various designs and aspects of BERs and their performances. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-40749136258"

A bioremediation assay was carried out in anaerobic conditions in order to degrade organic compounds. In these conditions, 100% of Dinoterb and Dinoseb were degraded after 75 days of culture, while RDX and HMX were not consumed. The 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis of this incubation showed a drastic reduction of the final biodiversity composed by clones related to Enterobacteriaceae (especially Leclercia adecarboxylata) and Pseudomonaceae family.

Although most blast-related injuries (eg, fragmentation injuries from improvised explosive devices and standard military explosives) can be managed in a similar manner to typical penetrating or blunt traumatic injuries, injuries caused by the blast pressure wave itself cannot. The blast pressure wave exerts forces mainly at air-tissue interfaces within the body, and the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and auditory systems are at greatest risk. Arterial air emboli arising from severe pulmonary injury can cause ischaemic complications-especially in the brain, heart, and intestinal tract. Attributable, in part, to the scene chaos that undoubtedly exists, poor triage and missed diagnosis of blast injuries are substantial concerns because injuries can be subtle or their presentation can be delayed. Management of these injuries can be a challenge, compounded by potentially conflicting treatment goals.

The rates of the initial slow phase that precedes the catalytic phase are significantly enhanced by irradiation, although the effect of simulated solar light on the rates of the fast phase is negligible. The absolute rates of the slow phase increase with the concentrations of Fe3+ and H2O2, whereas the initial rate of the degree of conversion increase decreases with organic matter loading.

The explosive chunks rested on glass frits in individual funnels and all precipitation interacting with them was collected and analyzed. Mass balance data reveal that TNT in the water samples accounts for only about one-third of the TNT lost from the chunks. The creation of photo-transformation products on the solid chunks, and their subsequent dissolution or sublimation, probably accounts for the other two-thirds. Although these products cannot, as yet, be quantified they are intrinsic to the outdoor weathering and fate of TNT-based explosives. TNT in our water samples was not photo-transformed. Thus, we used the yearlong, dissolved-mass time-series to validate a drop-impingement dissolution model for TNT. The model used measured rainfall and air temperature data as input, and the results agreed remarkably well with TNT dissolved-mass time-series measured for the year.

Data sources were organized and summarized by topic - explosive removal methods, physics of underwater explosions, sea turtle resources, documented impacts to sea turtles, and mitigation of effects. Information was gathered via electronic database searches and literature source review. Bulk explosive charges are the most commonly used technique in EROS. While the physical principles of underwater detonations and the propagation of pressure and acoustic waves are well understood, there are significant gaps in the application of this knowledge. Impacts to sea turtles from explosive removal operations may range from non-injurious effects (e.g. acoustic annoyance; mild tactile detection or physical discomfort) to varying levels of injury (i.e. non-lethal and lethal injuries). Very little information exists regarding the impacts of underwater explosions on sea turtles. Effects of explosions on turtles often must be inferred from documented effects to other vertebrates with lungs or other gas-containing organs, such as mammals and most fishes. However, a cautious approach should be used when determining impacts to sea turtles based on extrapolations from other vertebrates. The discovery of beached sea turtles and bottlenose dolphins following an explosive platform removal event in 1986 prompted the initiation of formal consultation between the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), authorized through the Endangered Species Act Section 7, to determine a mechanism to minimize potential impacts to listed species. The initial consultation resulted in a requirement for oil and gas companies to obtain a permit (through separate consultations on a case-by-case basis) prior to using explosives in Federal waters. Because many offshore structure removal operations are similar, a ""generic"" Incidental Take Statement was established by the NMFS that describes requirements to protect sea turtles when an operator's individual charge weights did not exceed 50 lb (23 kg). Requirements associated with the Incidental Take Permit were revised in 2003 and 2006 to accommodate advances in explosive charge technologies, removals of structures in deeper waters, and adequate protection of deep water marine mammal species in Gulf of Mexico waters. Generally, these requirements include pre- and post-detonation visual monitoring using standard surface and aerial survey methods for sea turtles and marine mammals, and, in some scenarios, passive acoustic survey methods for marine mammals within a specified radius from an offshore structure. The survey program has been successful in mitigating impacts to sea turtles associated with EROS. However, even with these protective measures in place, there have been observations of sea turtles affected by explosive platform removals. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

PMSO was applied as a 10 cm layer on top of the soil, and Composition B detonation residues from a 55-mm mortar round were applied at the surface of each of the lysimeters. Dissolution of the residues occurred during natural precipitation events over the course of 18 months. Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) emanating from the Composition B residues were significantly reduced by the PO2 PMSO material compared to the untreated control. Soil pore water RDX concentrations and RDX fluxes were reduced over 100-fold compared to the control plots at comparable depths. Residual RDX in the soil profile was also significantly lower in the PMSO treated plots. PO1 PMSO resulted in lower reductions in RDX transport than the PO2 PMSO.

This is based on the hydrolysis of HMTD releasing H2O2 and the electrochemical redox cycling of FeII/IIIEDTA via the following scheme:FeIIIEDTA + e-→FeIIEDTAFeIIEDTA + HOOH→FeIIIEDTA + HO{radical dot} + HO-. where FeEDTA is the ethylenediaminetetraacetate complex. Cyclic voltammetric results indicate an electrocatalytic (EC′) mechanism. Mass transport aided chronoamperometry at a carbon disk electrode (Estep = - 400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) gave a limit of detection of 30 μM (3Sb/m). Most interestingly, the hydrolysis of HMTD was found to be rapid under mild reaction conditions which was found to be complete, and nearly instantaneously when exposed to a 50/50 (v/v%) water/acetonitrile solution at pH 2.1. This is in contrast with previous investigations that require harsher conditions. Neutralization or further derivatization steps were not necessary as the FeII/IIIEDTA complex acted as an electron shuttle under these conditions. These results indicate a basis for a fast, one-step, and inexpensive detector for HMTD. Based on the results of a previous study, the simultaneous detection of HMTD with another improvised explosive, triacetone triperoxide is a strong possibility. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Phytoremediation is being increasingly proposed as a viable alternative to conventional remediation technologies to clean up explosives-contaminated sites. Despite the potential of this technology, relatively little is known about the innate enzymology of TNT detoxification in plants. To further elucidate this, we used microarray analysis to identify Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes up-regulated by exposure to TNT and found that the expression of oxophytodienoate reductases (OPRs) increased in response to TNT. The OPRs share similarity with the Old Yellow Enzyme family, bacterial members of which have been shown to transform explosives. The three predominantly expressed forms, OPR1, OPR2, and OPR3, were recombinantly expressed and affinity purified. Subsequent biochemical characterization revealed that all three OPRs are able to transform TNT to yield nitro-reduced TNT derivatives, with OPR1 additionally producing the aromatic ring-reduced products hydride and dihydride Meisenheimer complexes. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OPR1 removed TNT more quickly from liquid culture, produced increased levels of transformation products, and maintained higher fresh weight biomasses than wild-type plants. In contrast, OPR1,2 RNA interference lines removed less TNT, produced fewer transformation products, and had lower biomasses. When grown on solid medium, two of the three OPR1 lines and all of the OPR2-overexpressing lines exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to TNT. These data suggest that, in concert with other detoxification mechanisms, OPRs play a physiological role in xenobiotic detoxification. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.","2-s2.0-70349196801"

Six CLE (different by species, cultivars and harvesting time) were tested and used as additives to the growth medium. It was shown that nitro aromatic compounds can be identified in the FT-IR absorption spectra by the characteristic band at 1,527 cm -1, and in CLE by the characteristic band at 1,602 cm-1. The intensity of the CLE band at 1,602 cm-1 correlated with the concentration of total nitrogen (R 2 = 0.87) and decreased upon the growth of bacteria.

The acid-tolerant yeast Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15 transformed TNT through hydride ion-mediated reduction of the aromatic ring (as the main pathway), resulting in the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate ions, as well as through nitro group reduction (as minor pathway), resulting in hydroxylamino- and aminoaromatics. TNT transformation depended on the yeasts' ability to acidify the culture medium through the production of organic acids. Aeration and a low medium buffer capacity favored yeast growth and resulted in rapid acidification of the medium, which influenced the rate and extent of TNT transformation. This is the first time that nitrate has been detected as a major product of microbial TNT degradation, and this work demonstrates the importance of pH on TNT biotransformation. The ability of Y. lipolytica AN-L15 to reduce the TNT aromatic ring to form TNT-hydride complexes, followed by their denitration, makes this strain a potential candidate for bioremediation of sites contaminated with explosives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our approach is to develop specific sensor coating materials based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Despite the known inhibition of radical polymerisations by nitro groups and the known shrinkage of the polymer lattice during/after drying we were able to synthesize particulate MIPs by suspension polymerisation as well as thin MIP coatings by direct surface polymerisation on quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). The best method to purify the porous beads was Soxhlet extraction followed by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SFE with sc-CO2) at mild conditions (150 bar, 50 °C). At least a removal of >99.7% of the template was achieved. Performance tests of TNT imprinted polymer beads showed that acrylamide (AA) and more pronounced also methacrylic acid (MAA) possessed an enhanced adsorption tendency for gaseous TNT. An adsorption of 2,4-DNT, dinitrotoluene, by these MIPs was not detected. Using 2,4-DNT as template and methacrylamide, MAAM, a positive imprint effect for gaseous 2,4-DNT was achieved with no measurable cross-sensitivity for 2,4,6-TNT. The thin MIP coatings directly synthesized on the QCMs showed thicknesses of 20 to up to 500 nm. Preliminary screening experiments were performed for five different monomers and three different solvents (acetonitrile, chloroform and dimethylformamide). Best adsorption properties for TNT vapour until now showed a PAA-MIP synthesized with chloroform.

The electron-withdrawing nitro group common to each of these explosives makes the electron capture detector (ECD) suitable for determination of low concentrations of explosives in soil, water, and air. GC-ECD and HPLC-UV concentration estimates of explosives residues in field-contaminated soils from hazardous waste sites were compared, and correlation (r > 0.97) was excellent between the two methods of analysis for each of the compounds most frequently detected: 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX). The analytes were extracted from soils with acetonitrile by 18 h of sonication in a cooled ultrasonic bath. Two soil-to-solvent ratios were evaluated: 2.00 g:10.00 ml and 25.0 g:50.0 ml. GC-ECD method detection limits were similar for the two soil-to-solvent ratios and were about 1 μg kg-1 for the di- and trinitroaromatics, about 10 μg kg-1 for the mono-nitroaromatics, 3 μg kg-1 for RDX, 25 μg kg-1 for HMX, and between 10 and 40 μg kg-1 for the nitrate esters (nitroglycerine [NG] and pentaerythritol tetranitrate [PETN]).

In order to understand the joint effects of TNT and RDX on earthworms, an important ecological and bioindicator species at the molecular level, we sampled worms (Eisenia fetida) exposed singly or jointly to TNT (50 mg/kg soil) and RDX (30 mg/kg soil) for 28 days and profiled gene expression in an interwoven loop designed microarray experiment using a 4k-cDNA array. Lethality, growth and reproductive endpoints were measured. Results: Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX had no significant effects on the survival and growth of earthworms, but significantly reduced cocoon and juvenile counts. The mixture exhibited more pronounced reproductive toxicity than each single compound, suggesting an additive interaction between the two compounds. In comparison with the controls, we identified 321 differentially expressed transcripts in TNT treated worms, 32 in RDX treated worms, and only 6 in mixture treated worms. Of the 329 unique differentially expressed transcripts, 294 were affected only by TNT, 24 were common to both TNT and RDX treatments, and 3 were common to all treatments. The reduced effects on gene expression in the mixture exposure suggest that RDX might interact in an antagonistic manner with TNT at the gene expression level. The disagreement between gene expression and reproduction results may be attributed to sampling time, absence of known reproduction-related genes, and lack of functional information for many differentially expressed transcripts. A gene potentially related to reproduction (echinonectin) was significantly depressed in TNT or RDX exposed worms and may be linked to reduced fecundity. Conclusions: Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX affected many biological pathways from innate immune response to oogenesis, leading to reduced reproduction without affecting survival and growth. A complex interaction between mixtures of RDX and TNT was observed at the gene expression level that requires further study of the dynamics of gene expression and reproductive activities in E. fetida.

Movement by human volunteers was found to enhance the available explosive trace signal above a baseline level. Clothing blocked some of this movement-generated trace signal. The detected signal levels were also found to vary significantly from volunteer to volunteer, indicating that human variability is an issue in explosive trace detection.

Several studies suggest TNT becomes more toxic as it degrades while others suggest TNT becomes less toxic. This study focused on the toxicity of TNT and several degradation products as well as the role of oxidative metabolism in the toxicity of TNT. The aquatic invertebrate Hyalella azteca was used to evaluate the toxicity of TNT and four of its degradation products. The most reduced degradation product, 2,4-diamino, 6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DANT) was the most toxic to H. azteca. However, 2,4-DANT was only a minor metabolite in H. azteca. The influence of metabolism on the toxicokinetics of TNT was assessed indirectly through the use of a CYP450 inducer and inhibitor. Treatment of organisms with β-napthoflavone (BNF), a CYP450 inducer, increased the toxicity of TNT and increased the rate of elimination and metabolism of TNT. Similar to BNF, organisms treated with clotrimazole (CTZ), a CYP450 inhibitor, resulted in increased toxicity and TNT metabolism.

This paper describes the development of a standard search task, which provides a systematic method for assessing the effectiveness of arms and explosives search dogs following training. This is the first documented use of ethological techniques to validate traditional ratings, which are based on handlers' opinions. The subjects were 26 male Labrador retrievers, which had completed 10 weeks of standardised search training to enable them to indicate the presence of a range of target scents (explosives). At the end of the training period each dog's ability to complete a standardised search task was assessed. The efficiency with which the dog searched and located a range of target scents, along with their concurrent behaviour, was recorded on videotape and assessed via both subjective and objective measures. Subjective ratings made by scientists were very similar to those made by experienced trainers, and produced two uncorrelated factors; general search ability, and ability to work without false indications. Objective ethological assessment of the dogs' behaviour produced four measures; free search thoroughness, location ability, systematic search behaviour, and mean number of false indications. The majority of these measures correlated significantly to the trainers' ratings of the dogs as taken throughout the training. The strongest correlation was with the subjective rating for general search ability. Of the four objective measures, free search thoroughness and location ability, combined with a smaller contribution from systematic search behaviour, also correlated strongly with the trainers' ratings of the same dogs. False indications were, however, apparently not reflected in the ratings of general search ability. This suggests that the standard search task provides similar, but more detailed information compared to the more traditional subjective method of assessing ability. We conclude that the standard search task method is a useful tool for future search dog research and ability assessments. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-33846609139"

In these systems a Restricted Access Material trap or liquid-chromatography precolumn (with a C18 or porous graphitic carbon, PGC, stationary phase) followed by a PGC analytical column are used for sample clean-up, enrichment and separation of the trace level analytes, which are then analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The relative merits of two MS ionization interfaces (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, APCI, and atmospheric pressure photoionization, APPI) were also compared for the MS identification and quantification of these analytes. APCI was found to be superior in cases where both alternatives are applicable. A major drawback when applying APPI is that no signal is obtained for the cyclic nitramines and nitrate esters. Using APCI, a wide spectrum of unstable compounds can be determined in a single analysis, and the feasibility of using large volume samples (up to 100 mL) in combination with the sensitivity of the MS detection system provide method detection limits ranging from 2.5 pg/mL (for 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 2,6-diamino-6-nitrotoluene) to 563 pg/mL (for pentaerythritol tetranitrate, PETN), with repeatability ranging from 2 to 7%. Other chemometric parameters such as robustness, selectivity, repeatability, and intermediate precision were also evaluated in the validation of the extraction methods for use in water analysis.

The concentration of these compounds over landmines is extremely low and well below the minimum detection limits of most field-portable chemical sensors. Carbowax was found to give good adsorption for 2,4-DNT vapour at higher temperature and reverse was in case of 2,6-DNT vapour. On the other hand, the same polymer film gives reasonably good adsorption for 1,4-DNB, more than 33% adsorption and poor response for 1,3-DNB, which is around only 20%. The adsorption rate was specific for all the four isomers as observed 0.81 ng/(cm2 min) for 2,4-DNT, 0.14 ng/(cm2 min) for 1,3-DNB, 0.07 ng/(cm2 min) for 2,6-DNT, and 0.04 ng/(cm2 min) for 1,4-DNB. This polymer was found to give different relative response to these nitro aromatic isomers. PDMS gives very good response for 2,4-DNT (98-100%) at 50 °C appears to be a distinguishing performance.

The present study describes biotransformation of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT in marine sediment sampled from a shipwreck site near Halifax Harbour. Incubation of either 2,4-DNT or 2,6-DNT in anaerobic sediment slurries (10% w/v) at 10 °C led to the reduction of both DNTs to their corresponding diaminotoluene (2,4-DAT and 2,6-DAT) via the intermediary formation of their monoamine derivatives (ANTs). The production of diaminotoluene was enhanced in the presence of lactate for both DNT isomers. Using [14C]-2,4-DNT less than 1% mineralization was observed as determined by liberated 14CO2. Sorption of DNTs, ANTs, and DATs was thus investigated to learn of their fate in marine sediments. Under anaerobic conditions, sorption followed the order: DNTs (Kd = 8.3-11.7 l kg-1) > ANTs (Kd = 4.5-7.0 l kg-1) > DATs (Kd = 3.8-4.5 l kg-1). Incubation of 2,4-DAT in aerobic sediment led to rapid disappearance from the aqueous phase. LC/MS analysis of the aqueous phase and the acetone sediment extract showed the formation of azo- and hydrazo-dimers and trimers, as well as unidentified polymers. Experiments with radiolabelled 2,4-DAT showed a mass balance distributed as follows: 22% in the aqueous phase, 24% in acetone extracts, and 50% irreversibly bound to sediment. We concluded that DNT in anoxic marine sediment can undergo in situ natural attenuation by reduction to DAT followed by oxidative coupling to hydrazo-oligomers or irreversible binding to sediment.

In the present work, various computational methods ranging from those based on thermo-chemistry of the detonation/combustion chemical reactions to those involving transient, nonlinear-dynamics based mechanical interactions between detonation products, air and water are used to better understand and quantify the beneficial effects of various potential explosion-mitigation mechanisms. In particular, the absorption of the detonation energy by water, water-aerosolization induced reduction in the shock speed, transfer of momentum from the explosion products to water and deceleration/suppression of the combustion reactions are examined computationally. The results obtained show that water evaporation which consumes a substantial portion of the detonation energy plays a dominant role in the overall water-induced explosion-mitigation process. The detonation-product-to- water momentum transfer which causes water aerosolization, on the other hand, is found to be a key prerequisite for efficient explosion mitigation. © BRILL 2007.","2-s2.0-34547537340"

At the study site, the main part of the contaminant inventory occurs in the upper 20 cm of the topsoil which is essentially composed of combustion residues. Besides, some Cu (cmax. = 16,877 mg/kg) and Pb (cmax. = 26,398 mg/kg) in this layer, As (cmax. = 175,907 mg/kg) and Zn (cmax. = 133,237 mg/kg) were detected in very high concentrations. The mobilities of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in the soil system were derived from ammonium nitrate eluates. They are strongly influenced by the soil pH and can be described by quadratic regression curves from which threshold pH values were calculated. Below these values more than 10% of the element content was available as mobile species. Within the examined pH range, this method could not be adopted for arsenic, because the mobility of As was only slightly controlled by the soil pH. In the heavily contaminated topsoil, Cu and Pb were fixed by the moderately acidic soil pH which varied from 4.8 to 5.8. No migration to the underlying horizons occurred. A different behavior was observed for As and Zn. The calculated threshold pH of Zn was 5.5, so certain amount of this element was transferred to the subsoil and the leachate (cmax. = 350 μg/l). However, a major dispersion of Zn was prevented by a rise of the soil pH in the carbonate-containing subsoil. Elevated concentrations of As were found in all soil horizons up to a depth of 2 m and also in the leachate (cmax. = 2377 μg/l). Contrary to Cu, Pb and Zn the mobility of As evidently was less affected by the subsoil. Regarding organic contaminants, nitroaromatic explosives were detected only in minor concentrations in the soil (cmax. = 14.7 mg/kg) and the leachate (cmax. = 13.5 μg/l). No aromatic organoarsenicals were detected in the soil and the leachate samples. The main hazard of the site is the severe arsenic contamination and the transfer of this carcinogen by leachate, surface runoff and probably by wind. Nevertheless, some studies on the effects of the contaminant inventory on the local vegetation revealed that ammonium nitrate elutable zinc is responsible for the spatial distribution of some tolerant plant species and not arsenic. Previously undetected buried munitions from the former delaboration facility can be an other source of environmental contaminants. This is supported by elevated concentrations of chlorate (cmax. = 71 mg/l) and perchlorate (cmax. = 0.8 mg/l) detected in the leachate samples.

Here, we present the characterization of an unusual microbial P450 system able to degrade RDX, consisting of flavodoxin reductase XplB and fused flavodoxin-cytochrome P450 XplA. The affinity of XplA for the xenobiotic compound RDX is high (K d = 58 μM) and comparable with the Km of other P450s toward their natural substrates (ranging from 1 to 500 μM). The maximum turnover (kcat) is 4.44 per s, only 10-fold less than the fastest self-sufficient P450 reported, BM3. Interestingly, the presence of oxygen determines the final products of RDX degradation, demonstrating that the degradation chemistry is flexible, but both pathways result in ring cleavage and release of nitrite. Carbon monoxide inhibition is weak and yet the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a potent inhibitor. To test the efficacy of this system for the remediation of groundwater, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing both xplA and xplB were generated.

Analysis of the explosives is performed under ambient conditions from virtually any surface in very short times (<5 s) including confirmatory tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments, while retaining the sensitivity and specificity that mass spectrometry offers. Increased selectivity is obtained both by MS/MS and by performing additional experiments in which additives are included in the spray solvent. These reactive DESI experiments (reactions accompanying desorption) produce such ions as the chloride and trifluoroacetate adducts of RDX and HMX or the Meisenheimer complex of TNT. Desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, a variant of DESI that uses gas-phase ions generated by atmospheric pressure corona discharges of toluene or other organic compounds, provides evidence for a heterogeneous-phase (gaseous ion/absorbed analyte) charge-transfer mechanism of DESI ionization in the case of explosives. Plastic explosives on surfaces were analyzed directly as fingerprints, without sample preparation, to test DESI as a possible method for in situ detection of explosives-contaminated surfaces. DESI also allowed detection of explosives in complex matrixes, including lubricants, household cleaners, vinegar, and diesel fuel. Absolute limits of detection for the neat explosives were subnanogram in all cases and subpicogram in the case of TNT. The DESI response was linear over 3 orders of magnitude for TNT. Quantification of RDX on paper gave a precision (RSD) of 2.3%.

Preliminary microsomal assays showed that one major metabolite was formed under anaerobic and aerobic conditions with both NADH and NADPH as cofactors. Metabolite formation was not inhibited by carbon monoxide but did not form in the absence of cofactor or with heat-killed microsomes. The major metabolite was identified as N-methyl-2,4,6-trinitroaniline (NMPA) by IR spectroscopy, 1H and 14C NMR, and chemical ionization/MS. Kinetic parameters of NMPA formation in the microsomal fraction were determined using Lineweaver-Burke plots. A Vmax of 448 nmoles/(min mg) of protein and Km of 1.25 mM was determined when NAD+ was the cofactor. When NADP+ was the cofactor, a Vmax of 139 nmoles/(min mg) of protein and a Km of 1.4 mM was determined. In the microsomal fraction, inhibition studies revealed that NMPA formation was slightly inhibited (10%) by 2′-AMP (2 mM) when NADP+, but not NAD+, was used as a cofactor. This suggests that NMPA formation is partially dependent on cytochrome-P450 reductase. NMPA formation was also inhibited by dicumarol (2 mM) when NADP+ (14%) and NAD+ (84%) (14%) were cofactors, suggesting that NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase catalyzes NMPA formation in the microsomes.

Low order detonations of high explosive payloads result in the patchy dispersal of particles of high explosive formulations over large areas of firing range soils. Dissolution of explosives from explosive formulation particles into soil pore water is a controlling factor for transport, fate, and effects of explosive compounds. We developed an empirical method to evaluate soils based on functionally defined effective dissolution rates. An automated Accelerated Solvent Extractor was used to determine the effective elution rates under controlled conditions of RDX and TNT from soil columns containing particles of Comp B. Contrived soils containing selected soil geosorbants and reactive surfaces were used to quantitatively determine the importance of these materials. Natural soils from training ranges of various soil types were also evaluated. The effects of geosorbants on effective elution rates were compound- and sorbent-specific. TNT elution was less than that of RDX and was greatly slowed by humic acid. Iron and iron-bearing clays reduced the effective elution rates of both RDX and TNT. This empirical method is a useful tool for directly generating data on the potential for explosives to leach from firing range soils, to identify general bulk soil characteristics that can be used to predict the potential, and to identify means to engineer soil treatments to mitigate potential transport.","2-s2.0-37549043216"

Further hazards can arise from metabolites of transformation, by-products of the manufacturing process, or incomplete combustion. This work examines the toxicity of polar nitro compounds relative to their parent compound 2,4,6-TNT using four different ecotoxicological bioassays (algae growth inhibition test, daphnids immobilization test, luminescence inhibition test, and cell growth inhibition test), three genotoxicological assays (umu test, NM2009 test, and SOS Chromotest), and the Ames fluctuation test for detection of mutagenicity. For this study, substances typical for certain steps of degradation/transformation of 2,4,6-TNT were chosen for investigation. This work determines that the parent compounds 2,4,6-TNT and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene are the most toxic substances followed by 3,5-dinitrophenol, 3,5-dinitroaniline and 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene. Less toxic are the direct degradation products of 2,4,6-TNT like 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene, and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene. A weak toxic potential was observed for 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene-5- sulfonic acid, and 2,6-diamino-4-nitrotoluene. Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3, 5,7-tetrazocine and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine show no hint of acute toxicity.

It is widely employed in ports of entry and by the military as a particle detector for explosives and drugs of abuse. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is an effective extraction technique that has been successfully employed in the field for the pre-concentration of a variety of compounds. Many organic high explosives do not have a high enough vapor pressure for effective vapor sampling. However, these explosives and their commercial explosive mixtures have characteristic volatile components detectable in their headspace. In addition, taggants are added to explosives to aid in detection through headspace sampling. SPME can easily extract these compounds from the headspace for IMS vapor detection. An interface that couples SPME to IMS was constructed and evaluated for the detection of the following detection taggants: 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB). The interface was also evaluated for the following common explosives: smokeless powder (nitrocellulose, NC), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (2,4,6-TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN).

The analytes are observed as the alkali metal ion complexes. Remarkably, collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the HMTD, TATP, and TrATrP complexes with Na+, K+, and Li+ occurs with retention of the metal, a process triggered by an unusual hemolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond, forming a distonic ion. This is followed by elimination of a fragment of 30 mass units, shown to be the expected neutral molecule, formaldehyde, in the case of HMTD, but shown by isotopic labeling experiments to be ethane in the cases of TATP and TrATrP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the suggested fragmentation mechanisms for the complexes. Binding energies of Na+ of 40.2 and 33.1 kcal/mol were calculated for TATP-Na+ and HMTD-Na+ complexes, suggesting a strong interaction between the peroxide groups and the sodium ion. Increased selectivity is obtained either by MS/MS or by doping the spray solvent with additives that produce the lithium and potassium complexes of TATP, HMTD, and TrATrP. Addition of dopants into the solvent spray increased the signal intensity by an order of magnitude. When pure alcohol or aqueous hydrogen peroxide was used as the spray solvent, the (HMTD + Na)+ complex was able to bind a molecule of alcohol (methanol or ethanol) or hydrogen peroxide, providing additional characteristic ions to increase the selectivity of analysis. DESI also allowed the rapid detection of peroxide explosives in complex matrixes such as diesel fuel and lubricants using single or multiple cation additives (Na+, K+, and Li+, and NH 4+) in the spray solvent Low-nanogram detection limits were achieved for HMTD, TrATrP, and TATP in these complex matrixes. The DESI response was linear over 3 orders of magnitude for HMTD and TATP on paper surfaces (1-5000 ng), and quantification of both peroxide explosives from paper gave precisions (RSD) of less than 3%. The use of pure water and compressed air as the DESI spray solution and nebulizing gas, respectively, showed similar ionization efficiencies to those obtained using methanol/water mixtures and nitrogen gas (the typical choices).

In the present study, we used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radiolabeled tracer methods to investigate the CL-20 uptake in the whole worm body after contact exposures. Worms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to filter paper spiked with non-radioactive or [U-14C]-labeled CL-20 for 1-3 d.

The HPLC method without radiolabeled tracer was far less sensitive with a detection limit of 2.17 μg CL-20 cm- 2.

At higher concentrations, the body concentration increased slowly and saturated at around 11 μg g- 1 dry mass resulting in an estimated lethal critical body burden of 10-15 μg CL-20 g- 1 dry mass.

It is unlikely, based on these data, that exposure conditions for these explosive compounds in the marine environment pose unacceptable risks to mussels, and it appears that potential for trophic transfer is quite low.","2-s2.0-34548695655"

Blast loadings on structures have typically been evaluated using empirical relationships. These relationships assume that there are no obstacles between the explosive device and the target. If a blast barrier is used to protect personnel or a structure behind it, the actual blast loading environment will be significantly reduced for some distance behind the barrier. This paper is concerned with an accurate prediction of the area of effectiveness behind the barrier using experimental data and a neural network-based model. To train and validate the neural network, a database is developed through a series of measurements of the blast environment behind the barrier. The principal parameters controlling the blast environment, such as wall height, distance behind the wall, height above ground, and standoff distance are used as the training input data. Peak overpressure and peak scaled impulse are used as the outputs in the neural network configuration. The trained and validated neural network is used to develop contour plots of overpressure and impulse adjustment factors to simplify the process of predicting the effectiveness of blast barriers. The developed model is also deployed in a stand-alone application that is used as a fast-running predictive tool for the blast overpressures and impulses behind the wall. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Four other drift gases (helium, neon, argon and sulfur hexafluoride) were also investigated but design limitations of the commercial instrument prevented their use for this application. When ion mobility was plotted against drift gas polarizability, the resulting slopes were often unique for individual ions, indicating that selectivity factors between any two analytes varied with the choice of drift gas.

The tests were conducted in a laboratory-scale chamber (V = 150 L) and in a container (V = 55 m3). Both smoke formulations appeared to be acutely toxic and genotoxic. For the 0.5- and 1-g burning experiments the responses were more pronounced with HC/Zn/TNT than with HC/Zn smoke. To study the irritation potency of the smokes, the mouse bioassay according to ASTM E 981-84 was applied.

Nevertheless, few data are available in the scientific literature for this type of multiple exposure. Soil organisms, such as earthworms, are one of the first receptors affected by the contamination of soil. Therefore, a reproductive study was conducted using Eisenia andrei in a forest-type soil. Both HMX and Pb decreased reproduction parameters (number of total cocoons, hatched cocoons, and surviving juveniles) individually. Based on the total number of cocoons, HMX was more toxic in a forest soil than Pb, with EC50 of 31 mg kg -1, and 1068 mg kg-1, respectively. The slope of the concentration-response curve was significantly greater in the case of Pb, which is consistent with the possibility that the two compounds do not act on the same target site. The response-addition model was used to predict the response of earthworms and to test for interaction between the two contaminants. The predicted toxicity was not significantly different than the observed toxicity, implying that Pb and HMX were considered noninteractive compounds. The combined action of Pb-HMX may be described, therefore, as dissimilar-noninteractive joint action in a forest soil. The results illustrate the relevance of considering the presence of metals in the risk assessment of explosive-contaminated sites because metals can add their toxicity to explosives.

This property is useful for engineering systems to detect volatiles and provides a way for artificial sensors to emulate the way crossreactive olfactory receptors respond to and encode single odorous compounds and mixtures. Recent studies show that the vertebrate olfactory receptor repertoire arises from an unusually large gene family and that the receptor types that have been tested so far show variable breadths of response. In designing biomimetic artificial noses, the challenge has been to generate a similarly large sensor repertoire that can be manufactured with exact chemical precision and reproducibility and that has the requisite combinatorial complexity to detect odors in the real world. Here we describe an approach for generating and screening large, diverse libraries of defined sensors using single-stranded, fluorescent dye-labeled DNA that has been dried onto a substrate and pulsed with brief exposures to different odors. These new solid-state DNA-based sensors are sensitive and show differential, sequence-dependent responses. Furthermore, we show that large DNA-based sensor libraries can be rapidly screened for odor response diversity using standard highthroughput microarray methods. These observations describe new properties of DNA and provide a generalized approach for producing explicitly tailored sensor arrays that can be rationally chosen for the detection of target volatiles with different chemical structures that include biologically derived odors, toxic chemicals, and explosives. © 2008 White et al.","2-s2.0-38949210255"

In this article, we describe the development of high-performance immunosensors for detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a prime component of the landmines and bombs used by terrorist and military forces. The immunosensors were constructed by physical adsorption and self-assembly methods, and their binding interactions with a monoclonal anti-TNT antibody were evaluated for TNT detection using the surface plasmon resonance technique. A home-made 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanine conjugate was used for physical adsorption. A poly(ethylene glycol) hydrazine hydrochloride thiolate was used in the construction of self-assembled monolayer surface and was immobilized with trinitrophenyl-β-alanine by the amide coupling method. The immunosensors were highly selective, regenerable, rapid, and exhibited remarkable sensitivity down to the parts-per-trillion level for TNT by the indirect competitive inhibition principle. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-34547197394"

Fenton's reagent was the only oxidant able to degrade TNT in solution (kapp = 0.0348 min- 1). When using iron oxide as heterogeneous catalyst at pH 3, specific reaction rate constants per surface area were ksurf = 1.47.10- 3 L min- 1 m- 2 and ksurf = 0.177 L min- 1 m- 2 for magnetite and pyrite, respectively while ferric iron minerals were inefficient for TNT degradation. The major asset of iron mineral catalyzed Fenton-like treatment has been the complete oxidation of the pollutant avoiding the accumulation of possible toxic by-products. In soil slurry systems, 38% abatement of the initial TNT concentration (2 g/kg) was reached after 24 h treatment time at neutral pH. Rate limiting steps were the availability of soluble iron at neutral pH together with desorption of the TNT fraction sorbed on the clay mineral surfaces. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Six chemicals, including explosives and heavy metals, posing potential risk to environmental and human health, were targeted in this study. A site-specific conceptual site model was constructed, based on effective, reasonable exposure pathways, to avoid any overestimation of the risk. Also, conservative default values were adapted to prevent underestimation of the risk when site-specific values were not available. The risks posed by the six contaminants were calculated using the API's Decision Support System for Exposure and Risk Assessment, with several assumptions. In the crater-formed-area (Ac), the non-carcinogenic risks (i.e., HI values) of tri-nitro-toluene (TNT) and Cd were slightly larger than 1, but for RDX (Royal Demolition Explosives) was over 50. The total non-carcinogenic risk of the whole gunnery range was calculated to be 62.5, which was a significantly high value. The carcinogenicity of Cd was estimated to be about 10-3, while that for Pb was about 5 × 10-4, which greatly exceeded the generally acceptable carcinogenic risk level of 10-4-10-6. It was concluded from the risk assessment that there is an immediate need for remediation of both carcinogens and non-carcinogens before construction of the reservoir. However, for a more accurate risk assessment, further specific estimations of the changes in environmental conditions due to the construction of the reservoir will be required; and more over, the effects of the pollutants to the ecosystem will also need to be evaluated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","2-s2.0-34547215826"

The FEL provides support and advice to the Home Office and UK police forces on matters relating to the criminal misuse of explosives. During 1989 the FEL established a weekly quality assurance testing regime in its explosives trace analysis laboratory. The purpose of the regime is to prevent the accumulation of explosives traces within the laboratory at levels that could, if other precautions failed, result in the contamination of samples and controls. Designated areas within the laboratory are swabbed using cotton wool swabs moistened with ethanol water mixture, in equal amounts. The swabs are then extracted, cleaned up and analyzed using Gas Chromatographs with Thermal Energy Analyzer detectors. This paper follows on from a previous published paper describing the regime and summarizing subsequent results from approximately 6 years of tests. Lessons learned and improvements made over the period are also discussed. Monitoring samples taken from surfaces within the trace laboratories and trace vehicle examination bay have, with few exceptions, revealed only low levels of contamination, predominantly of RDX. Analysis of the control swabs, processed alongside the monitoring swabs, has demonstrated that in this environment the risk of forensic sample contamination, assuming all the relevant anti-contamination procedures have been followed, is so small that it is considered to be negligible.

This is particularly true with energetic compounds such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). One potentially promising technology for addressing runoff in a passive, sustainable, and low-cost manner is the use of constructed wetlands to intercept flow. This research effort investigated the ability of down-flow constructed wetlands to remediate RDX-contaminated water at varying loading rates over a period of 2 years. The impact of competing electron acceptors (NO3- and SO42-), the role of plants in the remediation process, and the production of initial daughter products were determined. Significant RDX removal occurred (89-96%) for all loading rates (160-1600 mg/(m2 day)) at a hydraulic retention time of approximately 2 days. RDX degradation occurred in both NO3- and SO42- dominated electron acceptor zones. RDX and NO3- degradation rate constants (kRDX and kN O3-) were also determined using a 1D transport model with dispersion. KRDX declined with the increase of influent RDX (6.2 - 0.8 d-1 for planted mesocosms). Changes in degradation rates may be the result of changing bioavailability of carbon released by the peat moss. kN O3- followed similar trends but was relatively greater than kRDX. Removal of plants is believed to have a small impact on overall RDX removal. RDX concentration in plant tissue was found to be semi-logarithmically related to RDX concentration in the rhizosphere. MNX, DNX, and TNX were observed as transient products generally proportional to RDX loading and low concentrations of MNX and DNX were detected in plant tissue at high RDX loading rates. Cessation of RDX exposure substantially reduced RDX concentrations plants over 6 weeks.

To assess the potential problem related to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), its post-blast residue was identified and quantified. In the first part of this study laboratory-scale samples of TNT (2 g) were detonated in a small-scale explosivity device (SSED) to evaluate the explosive power and collect post-blast residue for chemical analysis. Initiator size was large relative to the TNT charge; thus, issues arose regarding choice of initiator, residue from the initiator, and afterburning of TNT. The second part of this study detonated 75 to 150 g of military-grade TNT (typical of antipersonnel mines) in 55-gal barrels containing various witness materials (metal plates, sand, barrel walls, the atmosphere). The witness materials were analyzed for explosive residue. In a third set of tests, 75-g samples of TNT were detonated over soil (from Fort Leonard Wood or Sandia National Laboratory) in an indoor firing chamber (100 by 4.6 by 2.7 m high). Targeted in these studies were TNT and four explosive-related compounds (ERC): 2,4-dintrotoluene (DNT), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), 2- and 4-aminodinitrotoluene (2-ADNT and 4-ADNT). The latter two are microbial degradation products of TNT. Post-blast residue was allowed to age in the soils as a function of moisture contents (5 and 10%) in order to quantify the rate of degradation of the principal residues (TNT, DNT, and DNB) and formation of the TNT microbial degradation products (2-ADNT and 4-ADNT). The major distinction between landmine leakage and post-blast residue was not the identity of the species but relative ratios of amounts. In landmine leakage the DNT/TNT ratio was usually greater than 1. In post-blast residue it was on the order of 1 to 1/100th of a percent, and the total amount of pre-blast residue (landmine leakage) was a factor of 1/100 to 1/1000 less than post-blast. In addition, landmine leakage resulted in low DNT/ADNT ratios, usually less than 1, whereas pre-blast residues started with ratios above 20. Because with time DNT decreased and ADNT increased, over a month the ratio decreased by a factor of 2. The rate of TNT degradation in soil observed in this study was much slower than that reported when initial concentrations of TNT were lower. Degradation rates yielded half-lives of 40 and 100 days for 2,4-DNT and TNT, respectively.","2-s2.0-0038725943"

The scope of the review encompasses the following subjects: (i) process fundamentals of SB and analysis of advantages and disadvantages; (ii) the most recent applications of SB to laboratory scale and commercial scale soil bioremediation, with a focus on pesticides, explosives, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated organic pollutants; (iii) trends on the use of surfactants to improve availability of contaminants and supplementation with degradable carbon sources to enhance cometabolism of pollutants; (iv) recent findings on the utilization of electron acceptors other than oxygen; (v) bioaugmentation and advances made on characterization of microbial communities of SB; (vi) developments on ecotoxicity assays aimed at evaluating bioremediation efficiency of the process. From this review it can be concluded that SB is an effective ad situ and ex situ technology that can be used for bioremediation of problematic sites, such as those characterized by soils with high contents of clay and organic matter, by pollutants that are recalcitrant, toxic, and display hysteretic behavior, or when bioremediation should be accomplished in short times under the pressure and monitoring of environmental agencies and regulators. SB technology allows for the convenient manipulation and control of several environmental parameters that could lead to enhanced and faster treatment of polluted soils: nutrient N, P and organic carbon source (biostimulation), inocula (bioaugmentation), increased availability of pollutants by use of surfactants or inducing biosurfactant production inside the SB, etc. An interesting emerging area is the use of SB with simultaneous electron acceptors, which has demonstrated its usefulness for the bioremediation of soils polluted with hydrocarbons and some organochlorinated compounds. Characterization studies of microbial communities of SB are still in the early stages, in spite of their significance for improving reactor operation and design optimization. We have identified the following niches of research needs for SB in the near and mid term future, inter alia: (i) application of SB with sequential and simultaneous electron acceptors to soils polluted with contaminants other than hydrocarbons (i.e., pesticides, explosives, etc.), (ii) evaluation of the technical feasibility of triphasic SB that use innocuous solvents to help desorbing pollutants strongly attached to soils, and in turn, to enhance their biodegradation, (iii) gaining deeper insight of microbial communities present in SB with the intensified application of molecular biology tools such as PCR-DGGE, PCR-TGGE, ARDRA, etc., (iv) development of more representative ecotoxicological assays to better assess the effectiveness of a given bioremediation process. © 2008 Robles-González et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2-s2.0-42349113587"

As people develop expertise, their motor control becomes less susceptible to interference from other tasks. Researchers propose a transition in human motor skill from active control to automaticity. This progression may also be the case with nonhuman animals. Differences in performance characteristics between expert, advanced, intermediate, and novice dogs competing in the sport of agility were investigated. There were statistically significant differences between dogs of varying competitive levels in speed, motor control, and signal detections suggestive of increasing motor control automaticity in highly skilled, or expert, dogs. The largest sequential motor control difference was between novice and intermediate dogs, d = .96, whereas the largest sequential signal detection difference was between advanced and expert dogs, d = .90. These findings have two significant implications for expertise researchers: first, the observed similarities between dogs and humans may enable dogs to be used as expert models; and second, expertise science and methods may be profitably employed in the future to create more proficient canine workers. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","2-s2.0-36049013999"

Headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) has been demonstrated to be an effective sampling method helping to identify active odor signature chemicals used by detector dogs to locate forensic specimens as well as a rapid pre-concentration technique prior to instrumental detection. Common ignitable liquids and common military and industrial explosives have been studied including trinitrotoluene, tetryl, RDX, HMX, EGDN, PETN and nitroglycerine. This study focuses on identifying volatile odor signature chemicals present, which can be used to enhance the level and reliability of detection of ILR and explosives by canines and instrumental methods. While most instrumental methods currently in use focus on particles and on parent organic compounds, which are often involatile, characteristic volatile organics are generally also present and can be exploited to enhance detection particularly for well-concealed devices. Specific examples include the volatile odor chemicals 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and cyclohexanone, which are readily available in the headspace of the high explosive composition C-4; whereas, the active chemical cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX) is not. The analysis and identification of these headspace 'fingerprint' organics is followed by double-blind dog trials of the individual components using certified teams in an attempt to isolate and understand the target compounds to which dogs are sensitive. Studies to compare commonly used training aids with the actual target explosive have also been undertaken to determine their suitability and effectiveness. The optimization of solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (GC/MSn) is detailed including interface development and comparisons of limits of detection. These instrumental methods are being optimized in order to detect the same target odor chemicals used by detector dogs to reliably locate explosives and ignitable liquids.","2-s2.0-1642556888"
