The experimental results showed that owing to the addition of reinforcing agent (styrene copolymer) with high glass transition temperature and high mechanical strength, the creep resistance performance of the modified formulation was improved with reduced creep strain and constant creep rate and prolonged creep failure time. A six-element mechanical model was applied to simulate the creep behaviors of TATB-based PBX and its modified formulation. The constitutive equation of creep curves under different conditions were obtained by nonlinear fit. The predicted theoretical results coincided quite well with the experimental data. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","2-s2.0-85032070381"

Here we review and critically evaluate the latest (the past five years) important advances in explosives detection, with details of the improvements over previous methods, and suggest possible avenues towards further advances in, e.g., stand-off distance, detection limit, selectivity, and penetration through camouflage or packaging. The review consists of two parts. Part I discussed methods based on animals, chemicals (including colorimetry, molecularly imprinted polymers, electrochemistry, and immunochemistry), ions (both ion-mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry), and mechanical devices. This part, Part II, will review methods based on photons, from very energetic photons including X-rays and gamma rays down to the terahertz range, and neutrons. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).","2-s2.0-84954379972"

Bruceton and Neyer methods were used as experimental protocols and for data reduction. The results are presented as 50 % probability of reaction (DH50). For AN, the DH50 values are widely varied among the participants, from sensitive to completely insensitive (limit of the equipment), with no real correlation among results. GP and the AN/GP mixture exhibited much more sensitivity overall and were in some cases within statistical values extrapolated from previous studies of RDX. The variability in results for the AN data is attributed to the difficulty in determining a positive reaction event for AN, as detailed by Neyer experiments and photography during positive reactions. Variability in results for the GP and AN/GP mixtures is attributed to equipment environment and detection criteria.

TzTA was prepared in good yields and characterized using analytical (elemental) and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, NMR) techniques. The crystal structure of sulfate salt of the molecule was solved by means of low temperature X-ray crystallography, which showed the co-planarity of the two rings. The sulfate salt of the molecule crystallized in monoclinic system P21/n, with a crystal density of 1.856gâ€‰cm-3. The thermal stability of the molecule was assessed by DSC. The molecule showed excellent thermal stability better than many known nitrogen rich energetic molecules and showed comparable thermal stability with HMX. Non-isothermal kinetics was performed on the molecule to derive the activation energy. Constant volume combustion energy was determined using oxygen bomb calorimeter and back calculated the heat of formation. Preliminary insight on the gas generating capability of the molecule was tested by measuring the dynamic pressure generated inside a closed bomb.

Ammonia is difficult to detect via direct injection into a GC-MS because of its low molecular weight and extreme polarity. To circumvent this issue, ammonia was derivatized directly onto a SPME fiber by the reaction of butyl chloroformate coated fibers with the ammonia to form butyl carbamate. A derivatized externally sampled internal standard (dESIS) method based upon the reactivity of diethylamine with unreacted butyl chloroformate on the SPME fiber to form butyl diethylcarbamate was established for the reproducible quantification of ammonia concentration. Both of these compounds are easily detectable and separable via GC-MS. The optimized method was then used to quantitate the vapor concentration of ammonia in the headspace of two commonly used improvised explosive device (IED) materials, ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and ammonium nitrate aluminum powder (Ammonal), as well as identify the presence of additional fuel components within the headspace. © 2015.","2-s2.0-84953348907"

The target OPEs included hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and methylethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). Under optimised conditions maximum degradations of 70% and 54% for TATP and HMTD, respectively were achieved at 162 μL min-1, and 9% degradation for MEKP at 180 μL min-1. Flow rates were precisely controlled in this single source pneumatic pressure driven multi-channel FIA system by model experiments on mixing of easily detectable component solutions. The linear range for detection of TATP, HMTD and H2O2 was 1-200 μM (r2=0.98-0.99) at both flow rates, while that for MEKP was 20-200 μM (r2=0.97) at 180 μL min-1. The detection limits (LODs) obtained were 0.5 μM for TATP, HMTD and H2O2 and 10 μM for MEKP. The detection times varied from 1.5 to 3 min in this FIA-CL system. Whilst the LOD for H2O2 was comparable with those reported by other investigators, the LODs and analysis times for TATP and HMTD were superior, and significantly, this is the first time the detection of MEKP has been reported by FIA-CL. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84930937020"

Up to date, vibrational spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have not been tested for the analysis of post-blast residues in spite of their interesting strengths for the forensic field. Therefore, this work proposes a simple and fast procedure for the sampling and analysis of consumer firework post-blast residues by a portable FTIR instrument with an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) accessory. In addition, the post-blast residues spectra of several consumer fireworks were studied in order to achieve the identification of their original chemical compositions. Hence, this work analysed 22 standard reagents usually employed to make consumer fireworks, or because they are related to their combustion products. Then, 5 different consumer fireworks were exploded, and their residues were sampled with dry cotton swabs and directly analysed by ATR-FTIR. In addition, their pre-blast fuses and charges were also analysed in order to stablish a proper comparison. As a result, the identification of the original chemical compositions of the post-blast samples was obtained. Some of the compounds found were potassium chlorate, barium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium perchlorate or charcoal. An additional study involving chemometric tools found that the results might greatly depend on the swab head type used for the sampling, and its sampling efficiency. The proposed procedure could be used as a complementary technique for the analysis of consumer fireworks post-blast residues. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84949439584"

As quantitative conversion of nitrogen in some materials (i.e., nitrate salts and nitro-organic compounds) is difficult, this study tests a recently published method - thermal decomposition without the addition of O2 - for the analysis of these materials. Methods Elemental analyzer/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) was used to compare the traditional combustion method (CM) and the thermal decomposition method (TDM), where additional O2 is eliminated from the reaction. The comparisons used organic and inorganic materials with oxidized and/or reduced nitrogen and included ureas, nitrate salts, ammonium sulfate, nitro esters, and nitramines. Previous TDM applications were limited to nitrate salts and ammonium sulfate. The measurement precision and accuracy were compared to determine the effectiveness of converting materials containing different fractions of oxidized nitrogen into N2. Results The δ13CVPDB values were not meaningfully different when measured via CM or TDM, allowing for the analysis of multiple elements in one sample. For materials containing oxidized nitrogen, 15N measurements made using thermal decomposition were more precise than those made using combustion. The precision was similar between the methods for materials containing reduced nitrogen. The %N values were closer to theoretical when measured by TDM than by CM. The δ15NAIR values of purchased nitrate salts and ureas were nearer to the known values when analyzed using thermal decomposition than using combustion. Conclusions The thermal decomposition method addresses insufficient recovery of nitrogen during elemental analysis in a variety of organic and inorganic materials. Its implementation requires relatively few changes to the elemental analyzer. Using TDM, it is possible to directly calibrate certain organic materials to international nitrate isotope reference materials without off-line preparation.

The work presented here addresses the need for a method to measure the collection efficiency performance of surface wipe materials as a function of the number of times a wipe is used to interrogate a surface. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of wipe reuse, i.e., the number of times a wipe is swiped across a surface, on the overall particle collection and IMS response. Two types of collection wipes (Teflon coated fiberglass and Nomex) were examined by swiping multiple times, ranging from 0 to 1000, over representative surfaces that are common to security screening environments. Particle collection efficiencies were determined by fluorescence microscopy and particle counting techniques, and were shown to improve dramatically with increased number of swiping cycles. Ion mobility spectrometry was used to evaluate the chemical response of known masses of explosives (deposited after reusing wipes) as a function of the wipe reuse number. Results show that chemical response can be negatively affected, and greatly depends upon the conditions of the surface in which the wipe is interrogating. For most parameters tested, the PCE increased after the wipe was reused several times. Swiping a dusty cardboard surface multiple times also caused an increase in particle collection efficiency but a decrease in IMS response. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed significant surface degradation of the wipes on dusty cardboard at the micrometer spatial scale level for Teflon coated wipes. Additionally, several samples were evaluated by including a seven second thermal desorption cycle at 235°C into each swipe sampling interval in order to represent the IMS heating cycle. Results were similar to studies conducted without this heating cycle, suggesting that the primary mechanism for wipe deterioration is mechanical rather than thermal. © 2015, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-84960194887"

Here, the feasibility of the ambient mass spectrometry technique desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) in the analysis of the most common nitrogen-based explosives is studied. Methods DAPPI and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) were compared in the direct analysis of trinitrotoluene (TNT), trinitrophenol (picric acid), octogen (HMX), cyclonite (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and nitroglycerin (NG). The effect of different additives in DAPPI dopant and in DESI spray solvent on the ionization efficiency was tested, as well as the suitability of DAPPI to detect explosives from a variety of surfaces. Results The analytes showed ions only in negative ion mode. With negative DAPPI, TNT and picric acid formed deprotonated molecules with all dopant systems, while RDX, HMX, PETN and NG were ionized by adduct formation. The formation of adducts was enhanced by addition of chloroform, formic acid, acetic acid or nitric acid to the DAPPI dopant. DAPPI was more sensitive than DESI for TNT, while DESI was more sensitive for HMX and picric acid. Conclusions DAPPI could become an important method for the direct analysis of nitroaromatics from a variety of surfaces.

In headspace SPME, analytes partition between the sample, the headspace above the sample, and the SPME fiber coating. In total vaporization SPME (TV-SPME), sample extracts are heated until both the solvent and analytes completely vaporize, whereupon the analytes partition between the vapor phase and the SPME fiber. In this study, TV-SPME using a polyethylene glycol fiber was coupled with fast gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify components of double-base smokeless powder (DBSP). Nitroglycerin (NG), diphenylamine (DPA) and ethyl centralite (EC) were separated in under 5 min. For NG, the optimal sample volume (70 μL), extraction temperature (60 °C) and extraction time (20 min) resulted in a method that was over twelve fold more sensitive than traditional liquid injection and with a detection limit below 1 ppb. This method was then used to quantify DBSP residue on post-blast debris from five galvanized steel pipe bombs. The mean concentration of NG on the fragments was 0.25 ppm (w/w). An average of 1.01 mg of NG was recovered from the devices. Finally, the distribution of NG could be ""mapped"" by tracking the original locations of each fragment within the device. These maps showed that the distribution of NG was far from uniform. In fact, the concentration of the NG on fragments originating from the end caps was several fold higher than in other locations.

In the field of mass spectrometry, separation methods, such as principal-component analysis (PCA) and independent-component analysis (ICA), are widely used. All components, however, have no negative values, and the orthogonality condition imposed on components also does not necessarily hold in the case of mass spectra. Because these methods allow negative values and PCA imposes an orthogonality condition, they are not suitable for separation of mass spectra. The proposed algorithm is based on probabilistic latent-component analysis (PLCA). PLCA is a statistical formulation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) using KL divergence. Because PLCA imposes the constraint of non-negativity but not orthogonality, the algorithm is effective for separating components of mass spectra. In addition, to estimate the components more accurately, a sparsity constraint is applied to PLCA for explosives detection. The main contribution is industrial application of the algorithm into an explosives-detection system. Results of an experimental evaluation of the algorithm with data obtained in a real railway station demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms PCA and ICA. Also, results of calculation time demonstrate that the algorithm can work in real time. Copyright © 2015 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","2-s2.0-84941003885"

Opto-calorimetric infrared (IR) spectroscopy, capable of obtaining molecular signatures of extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules, has been realized with the use of microheater/thermometer devices and a widely tunable quantum cascade laser. These devices respond to the heat generated by non-radiative decay process when the adsorbed explosive molecules are resonantly excited with IR light. Monitoring the variation in microthermometer signal as a function of illuminating IR wavelength corresponds to the conventional IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, the mass of the adsorbed molecules is determined by measuring the resonance frequency shift of the device for the quantitative analysis. In addition, micro-differential thermal analysis, which can be used to differentiate exothermic or endothermic reaction of heated molecules, has been performed with the same devices to provide additional orthogonal signal for trace explosive detection and sensor surface regeneration. We have demonstrated successful detection, differentiation, and quantification of trace amounts of explosive molecules (cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) and their mixtures using three orthogonal sensing signals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For this reason, nano-crystalline explosives present an attractive alternative to conventional energetics. In this study, formulations consisting of 95% octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and 5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) were prepared with mean crystal sizes ranging from 300 nm to 2 μm. The process to create these materials used a combination of mechanical particle size reduction and spray drying, which has the advantages of direct control of crystal size and morphology as well as the elimination of ripening of crystals (which occurs during slurry coating of nanomaterials). The basic physical characteristics of these formulations were determined using a variety of techniques, including scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Compressive stress-strain tests on pressed pellets revealed that the mechanical properties of the compositions improved with decreasing crystal size, consistent with Hall-Petch mechanics. The 300 nm HMX/PVOH composition demonstrated a 99% and 129% greater strength and stiffness, respectively, than the composition with 2 μm HMX. The formulations were subjected to the Small Scale Gap Test, revealing a significant reduction in shock sensitivity with decreasing crystal size. The formulation containing 300 nm HMX registered a shock initiation pressure 1.6 GPa above that of the formulation with 2 μm HMX, a 44% improvement in sensitivity.

Therefore, an on-site detection method for TATP and HMTD is urgently needed. Herein, we developed a stand-alone dopant-assisted positive photoionization ion mobility spectrometry (DAPP-IMS) coupled with time-resolved thermal desorption introduction for rapid and sensitive detection of TATP and HMTD in complex matrices, such as white solids, soft drinks, and cosmetics. Acetone was chosen as the optimal dopant for better separation between reactant ion peaks and product ion peaks as well as higher sensitivity, and the limits of detection (LODs) of TATP and HMTD standard samples were 23.3 and 0.2 ng, respectively. Explosives on the sampling swab were thermally desorbed and carried into the ionization region dynamically within 10 s, and the maximum released concentration of TATP or HMTD could be time-resolved from the matrix interference owing to the different volatility. Furthermore, with the combination of the fast response thermal desorber (within 0.8 s) and the quick data acquisition software to DAPP-IMS, two-dimensional data related to drift time (TATP: 6.98 ms, K0 = 2.05 cm2 V-1 s-1 HMTD: 9.36 ms, K0 = 1.53 cm2 V-1 s-1) and desorption time was obtained for TATP and HMTD, which is beneficial for their identification in complex matrices. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84966270791"

The trace-explosives detector consists of an automated particles sampler and a compact mass spectrometer. In the automated particles sampler, particles adhering to a surface of the detection targets are removed by air jets. A cyclone preconcentrator is then used to collect the particles removed from the detection targets. The collected particles are vaporized by a vaporizer, and the vaporized molecules are analyzed by the mass spectrometer. For the passenger screening, the trace-explosives detector was installed into a boarding gate. When a passenger passes an electronic ticket (e-ticket) or IC card over the e-ticket reader of the boarding gate, compressed air jets are emitted from a nozzle toward the e-ticket. The throughput of the passenger screening is ∼ 1200 persons/hour. For the baggage screening, on the other hand, the trace-explosives detector was combined with a conventional X-ray baggage screener. When a bag is put on the conveyor belt of the automated particle sampler, compressed air jets are emitted from nozzles. The trace analysis is finished, while an X-ray image of the bag is being obtained by the X-ray baggage screener.

The sample preparation is simple and takes place in a test tube, employing standard equipment of a forensics laboratory. The protocol was optimized and applied to seven, both high and low, commercial explosives, which contained the substance of interest. Moreover, three explosives in the absence of NC were tested to cross check for false positives. Fourteen different standard explosive substances that are usually found in explosive mixtures were then employed in order to monitor the effect of the method on these compounds and check for interferences. Results showed that NC was detected, by its trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives, in all the explosive mixtures analyzed and no false positives were observed.

The conventional algorithm based on probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA) is effective in many cases because it makes use of the fact that non-negativity and sparsity hold for mass spectra in explosives detection. The algorithm, however, fails to separate mass spectra in some cases because uncertainty can not be resolved only by non-negativity and sparsity constraints. To resolve the uncertainty, an algorithm based on shift-invariant PLCA (SIPLCA) utilizing temporal correlation of mass spectra is proposed in this paper. In addition, to prevent overfitting, the temporal correlation is modeled with a function representing attenuation by focusing on the fact that the amount of a substance is attenuated continuously and slowly with time. Results of an experimental evaluation of the algorithm with data obtained in a real railway station demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the PLCA-based conventional algorithm and the simple SIPLCA-based one. The main novelty of this paper is that an evaluation of the detection performance of explosives detection is demonstrated. Results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed separation algorithm can improve the detection performance.

The magnitude of this variation is attributed to differences in operator, method, and environment as well as the use of different instruments that are also of varying age. The results appear to be a good representation of results generated by the broader safety testing community based on the range of methods, instruments, and environments included in the IDCA proficiency test. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

The ion source pressures were changed by using various sizes of the ion sampling orifice. The signal intensities of those analytes showed marked pressure dependence. TNT was detected with higher sensitivity at lower pressure but vice versa for other analytes. For all analytes, a marked signal enhancement was observed when a grounded cylindrical mesh electrode was installed in the DBD ion source. Among nine analytes, RDX, HMX, NG and PETN could be detected as cluster ions [analyte + NO3]- even at low pressure and high temperature up to 180 °C. The detection indicates that these cluster ions are stable enough to survive under present experimental conditions.

Scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction analyses were used to characterize CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts. The samples are prepared using the sol-gel method with different mole ratios. Furthermore, the samples are tested to evaluate their effect on the LiClO4 decomposition at various temperatures. The blank tests comparison shows that the CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts strongly enhance the LiClO4 decomposition. Moreover, CuCr2O4 is formed in the CrxCu(1-x)O(1+0.5x) catalysts. The Cr-Cu binary composite catalysts show smaller crystallites, larger surface area, and better catalytic performance than the pure CuO samples because of the interaction of Cr and Cu ions.

This method uses a controlled flow of vapor from a solid-phase HMTD source that is presented to an ambient-pressure-ionization mass spectrometer equipped with a secondary-electrospray-ionization (SESI) source. The subpart-per-trillion sensitivity of this system enables direct detection of HMTD vapor through an intact [M + H]+ ion in real time at temperatures near 20°C. By calibrating this method using vapor sources of cocaine and heroin, which have known pressure-temperature (P-T) curves, the temperature dependence of HMTD vapor was determined, and a Clausius-Clapeyron plot of ln[P (Pa)] vs 1/[T (K)] yielded a straight line with the expression ln[P (Pa)] = {(-11091 ± 356) × 1/[T (K)]} + 25 ± 1 (error limits are the standard error of the regression analysis). From this equation, the sublimation enthalpy of HMTD was estimated to be 92 ± 3 kJ/mol, which compares well with the theoretical estimate of 95 kJ/mol, and the vapor pressure at 20°C was estimated to be ∼60 parts per trillion by volume, which is within a factor of 2 of previous theoretical estimates. Thus, this method provides not only the first direct experimental determination of HMTD vapor pressure but also a rapid, near-real-time capability to quantitatively measure low-vapor-pressure compounds, which will be useful for aiding in the development of training aids for bomb-sniffing canines. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84948415520"

Oxidative fluorescence quenching is emerging as a high sensitivity method for detecting such materials but is prone to false positives - everyday items such as perfumes elicit similar responses. Here we report thin films of light-emitting dendrimers that detect vapours of explosives and taggants selectively - fluorescence quenching is not observed for a range of common interferents. Using a combination of neutron reflectometry, quartz crystal microbalance and photophysical measurements we show that the origin of the selectivity is primarily electronic and not the diffusion kinetics of the analyte or its distribution in the film.

An understanding of the postblast explosive particle morphology would provide vital information during forensic examinations, allowing rapid initial indication of the explosive material to be microscopically determined prior to any chemical analyses and thereby saving time and resources at the crucial stage of an investigation. In this study, condensed phase particles collected from around the detonations of aluminized ammonium nitrate and RDX-based explosive charges were collected in a novel manner utilizing SEM stubs. By incorporating the use of a focused ion beam during analysis, for the first time it is possible to determine that such particles have characteristic shapes, sizes, and internal structures depending on the explosive and the distance from the detonation at which the particles are recovered. Spheroidal particles (10-210 μm) with microsurface features recovered following inorganic charge detonations were dissimilar to the irregularly shaped particles (5-100 μm) recovered following organic charge firings. Confirmatory analysis to conclude that the particles were indeed explosive included HPLC-MS, Raman spectroscopy, and mega-electron volt-secondary ionization mass spectrometry. These results may impact not only forensic investigations but also the theoretical constructs that govern detonation theory by indicating the potential mechanisms by which these particles survive and how they vary between the different explosive types.

These self-assembled aggregates typically undergo stimuli-induced reversible assembly and disassembly. They thus hold great promise as so-called functional materials. In this work, we present the design, synthesis, and responsive behavior of a short supramolecular oligomeric system based on two hetero-complementary subunits. These ""monomers"" consist of a tetrathiafulvalene-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole (TTF-C[4]P) and a glycol diester-linked bis-2,5,7-trinitrodicyanomethylenefluorene-4-carboxylate (TNDCF), respectively. We show that when mixed in organic solvents, such as CHCl3, CH2ClCH2Cl, and methylcyclohexane, supramolecular aggregation takes place to produce short oligomers stabilized by hydrogen bonding and donor-acceptor charge-transfer (CT) interactions. The self-associated materials were characterized by 1H NMR and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy, as well as by concentration- and temperature-dependent absorption spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses of both the monomeric and oligomerized species. The self-associated system produced from TTF-C[4]P and TNDCF exhibits a concentration-dependent aggregation behavior typical of supramolecular polymers. Further support for the proposed self-assembly came from theoretical calculations. The fluorescence emitting properties of TNDCF are quenched under conditions that promote the formation of supramolecular aggregates containing TTF-C[4]P and TNDCF. This quenching effect has been utilized as a probe for the detection of substrates in the form of anions (i.e., chloride) and nitroaromatic explosives (i.e., 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene).

Deprotonated ions and adducts with molecular oxygen, nitrite, and nitrate were observed in the mass spectral responses of these compounds. A global optimum temperature of 350 °C for the by-products investigated here enabled single nanogram to sub nanogram trace detection. Matrix effects were examined through a series of mixtures containing one or more compounds (sugar alcohol precursors, by-products, and/or explosives) across a range of mass loadings.

Rapid reaction rates make the detonation mechanisms of HEDMs difficult to understand, so computational tools are used to predict trigger bonds - weak bonds that break, leading to detonation. Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) have been used to compare bond densities in HEDMs to reference molecules to provide a relative scale for the bond strength to predict the activated bonds most likely to break to trigger an explosion. This analysis confirms that X-NO2 (X=N,C,O) bonds are trigger linkages in common HEDMs such as TNT, RDX and PETN, consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. Calculations on a small test set of substituted tetrazoles show that the assignment of the trigger bond depends upon the functionality of the material and that the relative weakening of the bond correlates with experimental impact sensitivities. Pull the trigger: Trigger bonds in explosive materials are proposed to break to initiate detonation.

In this work, we have overcome this problem by developing layer by layer polymer detectors and an electronic prototype for instant detection of a ppm level concentration of picric acid vapour via impedance spectroscopy. The detectors constitute mainly two polymer layers with poly-cholesteryl methacrylate sulfonated hexene as the two outer layers and a copolymer of 2-vinyl pyridine with acrylonitrile as the middle layer. In the presence of the analyte, the detectors undergo a steep decrease in impedance within a few seconds. The thickness of the individual polymer layers plays a vital role and it was observed that the detector with thinner outer layers (0.25 mm) is more efficient as it shows about a 99% decrease in the impedance for 0.334 ppm of picric acid vapour within 10 seconds. The method is selective, the effect of varying humidity is negligible and the detection limit was found to be 0.006 ppm. Moreover, the detectors show reproducible results and are also consistent for a long period. Using these detectors, we have designed an electronic prototype for visual detection of picric acid at room temperature.

The Young's modulus and hardness of four traps and seven substrates were measured using nanoindentation. These properties determine how deformation occurs when traps are applied for contact sampling of explosives. The nanoindentation data were analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method, and an indenter area function was created using silicon and gold as the reference materials. The Young's moduli of the traps ranged from 0.2 to 8 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.5 to 4 GPa. The hardness values of the traps ranged from 0.005 to 0.22 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 GPa. For each of 20 scenarios (4 traps, 5 surfaces), six contact simulations were performed. In these contact simulations, the Greenwood-Willliamson microcontact model was used to represent the behavior of the asperities on the traps, while the Timoshenko Beam model was used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the bulk trap materials spanning the space between asperities. This combination of feature- and trap-scale modeling provides a more realistic description of the interfacial contact than either model applied individually. The calculated distributions of separation distances between the traps and surfaces when the traps were contacted with the surfaces under a normal load were compared to estimate the relative effectiveness of the traps at interrogating the topography of the surfaces.

The plasma source allows liquid or solid samples to be examined almost instantaneously without any sample preparation in the open environment. The advantages of low carrier gas and low power consumption (<6 W), as well as zero solvent usage, have aided in developing the field-ready, hand-held device for trigger-based, ""near-real-time"" sampling/ionization. Individual nitroaromatic explosives (such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) can be easily detected in amounts as low as 5.8 pg with a linear dynamic range of at least 10 (10-100 pg), a relative standard deviation of ca. 7%, and an R2 value of 0.9986. Direct detection of several nitroaromatic compounds in a complex mixture without prior sample preparation is demonstrated, and their identities are confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-84943173604"

To ascertain the effectiveness of the TiO2 nanocatalyst, the thermal kinetic constants for the catalytic and non-catalytic decomposition of AN and AN propellant samples were computed by using a nonlinear integral isoconversional method. Catalytic influence was evident from the lowering of activation energy for the catalyzed decomposition reactions.

Methods It was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on a UPLC-TOF instrument. Alkali metal salts were used to promote the formation of ions. Results In the full scan positive ion mode a 3 ng (13 pmol) limit of detection was achieved if [HMTD + Me]+ ions (Me = Li, Na, K) were detected. It was found that HMTD easily undergoes oxidation to tetramethylene diperoxide diamine dialdehyde (TMDDD) in the source as well as in the samples. TMDDD can be detected as [TMDDD + Me]+ ions, but better ionization efficiency leads to the detection limit of TMDDD at the 2 pg (0.01 pmol) level. In butyl acetate the yield of oxidation of HMTD to TMDDD reaches 25% within 20 min at 120 C, which offers a simple way of improving the detection limit of HMTD by two orders of magnitude. Conclusions A simple procedure of detection of HMTD that matches the most sensitive methods available was developed. It uses standard equipment available in many laboratories. It was shown that the frequently reported [HMTD-H]+ cation observed by various authors was in fact a misinterpretation of the results, and should be attributed to [TMDDD + H]+. © 2015 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-84945966868"

In practice, LPGC is implemented by placing the outlet of a short, wide (typically 10-15 m, 0.53 mm inner diameter) analytical column under vacuum conditions, which speeds the separation by reducing viscosity of the carrier gas, thereby leading to a higher optimal flow rate for the most separation efficiency. To keep the inlet at normal operating pressures, the analytical column is commonly coupled to a short, narrow uncoated restriction capillary that also acts as a guard column. The faster separations in LPGC usually result in worse separation efficiency relative to conventional GC, but selective detection usually overcomes this drawback. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides highly selective and sensitive universal detection, and nearly all GC-MS instruments provide vacuum outlet conditions for implementation of LPGC-MS(/MS) without need for adaptations. In addition to higher sample throughput, LPGC provides other benefits, including lower detection limits, less chance of analyte degradation, reduced peak tailing, increased sample loadability, and more ruggedness without overly narrow peaks that would necessitate excessively fast data acquisition rates. This critical review summarizes recent developments in the application of LPGC with MS and other detectors in the analysis of pesticides, environmental contaminants, explosives, phytosterols, and other semi-volatile compounds. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84946204363"

In this work, a hollow cathode discharge (HCD) ion source was developed for the detection of explosives using ambient air as a carrier gas. Methods To detect nonvolatile and thermally unstable explosives with high sensitivities, a new HCD ion source was designed and coupled with an ion trap mass spectrometer. Results Five explosives - hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), nitroglycerin (NG) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) - were detected with limits of detection of lower than ng. The intensities of the NO3- adduct ions with RDX, PETN, and NG showed a marked increase with increase in ion source pressure in the range of 1-28 Torr.

It is proposed that the NOx- (x = 2, 3) and O3 contributed to the formation of [TNT-H]- and [TNT-NO]- ions, via the reactions NOx- + TNT → [TNT-H]- + HNOx and [TNT]- + O3 → [TNT-NO]- + NO2 + O2.

An orthogonal array design (DAD) was employed to construct the calibration set, which contains 27 reference samples. The calibration models were constructed using Partial Least Square regression (PLS-1) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The variables were selected by the Successive Projection Algorithm (SPA) in MLR model. The predictive ability of the optimized models was validated by a test set including 18 samples. Finally, the two optimized models were successfully applied to simultaneously determine the content of PETN, RDX and TNT in five real binary-component PBX samples. Satisfactory results were obtained for the two models, in which the recovery yields were close to 100% for all the analytes. The computed elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) further shows that the two models have no proportional and constant errors in the predicted concentrations.

Owing to its high versatility, major advancements have been made with regard to the instrumental set-ups during the last years. New strategies have been proposed to develop high-sensitive methods, portable CE or miniaturized devices. These techniques are of great interest in the analysis of explosives, which generally requires a highly selective approach. This review provides a recent perspective (from the beginning of 2008 to March 2015) on the use of CE for the analysis of explosives. First, a general description of explosives is made, emphasizing the role of separation techniques and specifically CE. Next, the most recent works focused on the analysis of explosives by using conventional CE, portable CE and microchip CE are compared and critically discussed. Besides, other emerging techniques for the analysis of explosives are referred and compared to CE results.

Based on the experimental results, corresponding numerical simulations using the commercial software LS-DYNA were undertaken. By inspecting the fragments recovered from the experiments and the numerical results, the dynamic fracture of the casing led to fragments of approximately three shapes: A large cuboid fragment, a small cuboid fragment, and two irregular fragments formed by three classical fracture trajectories.

Evaluation requires dynamic measurements of detonation velocity, pressure, and expansion energy - typically in separate experiments that require large amounts of material, time, and expense. There is also a need for evaluation of the total available thermodynamic energy. The dynamic evaluations, in particular, have been a major hindrance to development of new explosives. The new experimental testing method to be described here requires small charges and obtains accurate measurement of all three of the detonation performance characteristics in a single test. The design, a Disc Acceleration eXperiment (DAX), provides an initial condition of steady detonation and a charge-geometry amenable to 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The velocity history of a metal disk attached to the end of the explosive charge is measured with Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV). This disc velocity data is analyzed to give both CJ pressure and expansion energy. The detonation velocity is obtained with probes along the charge length. The experiments and subsequent analyses are concentrated on LX-16, a known PETN based explosive, for the purpose of establishing the accuracy of the method and to provide a standard for comparison with other explosives. We present details of the experimental design and also detonation velocity and PDV results from a number of experiments. The total available internal energy for the explosive was obtained from published detonation calorimetry measurements by Ornellas [1], and from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. An equation-of-state (EOS) for LX-16 was derived from hydrodynamic simulations of thin plate-push velocity-time data.

Moreover, the magnetic response of ferromagnetic Fe3O4 microspheres can be used to dynamically modulate the optical property of Ag NPs through controlling their geometric arrangement on the substrate by applying an external magnetic field. It is also demonstrated from the full-wave numerical simulation results that the maximum electromagnetic field enhancement can be greatly increased by shortening the distance of neighboring Ag NPs and therefore resulting in an improved SERS detecting limit.

This allowed for a direct comparison of the results from each participant to the average of the results from all the participants. Some general trends observed for each series of tests were: (1) Drop hammer - LLNL usually found the materials less sensitive than the average with materials that have high sensitivity to impact and LANL usually found the materials less sensitive than the average with materials that have high sensitivity to impact; (2) friction - LLNL found the materials less sensitive than the average; (3) and ESD - IHD usually found the materials less sensitive than the average.

The optical properties of the two silanes were completely opposite to the traditional luminescent materials. Unlike the aggregation caused quenching, they all emit faint fluorescence in the dispersed state, while emission intensity increased sharply in aggregate states. Fluorescence spectra showed that the two compounds exhibited AIEE properties and that is due to the weak π-π stacking caused by the restriction of intramolecular rotations of dye segments, particularly the -SiMe3 and thienyl groups in the aggregate state. As fluorescent (FL) probes, the fluorescence quenching behavior was further investigated. Thanks to the richer-electron thiophene groups, both compounds showed good performance in detecting nitroaromatics, especially picric acid (PA).

For DPTB-MPS, the addition of 80 μM nitrobenzene, 60 μM m-nitrobenzene and 40 μM PA resulted in about 50% quenching in aqueous solutions.

The photochemically inert cyclotriphosphazene moieties intentionally introduced into the structure of the sensor could play a role not only in connecting curcumin fluorophores to construct a highly cross-linked fluorescent architecture with excellent thermal stability and photobleaching stability, but also in effectively enriching PA from bulk solution to the surface of the sensor by the acid-base interaction between the acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups of PA molecules and the electron-rich nitrogen atoms of the cyclotriphosphazene units, which might facilitate the formation of a ground-state non-fluorescent complex of the microspheres and PA as well as the excited-state energy transfer from the microspheres to PA. Therefore, PCPC-MS exhibited a fluorescence quenching response towards PA with high sensitivity, efficiency, and selectivity over a number of other analytes such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 4-nitrotoluene, nitrobenzene, 4-benzoquinone, chlorobenzene, and nitromethane in methanol. In addition, PCPC-MS could also effectively detect PA in the presence of the other analytes, indicating their remarkable ability for resisting interferences and specific recognition of PA.

The predictive performance of the optimized models was validated by 21 explosive samples in an independent test set. The standard errors of prediction (SEP) were lower than 1.4 μg mL-1 for HMX, 2.2 μg mL-1 for RDX, and 0.8 μg mL-1 for TNT in both PLS models.

Diffusion of an analyte into an organic semiconductor thin film, and its subsequent interaction with the chromophore are key factors that govern the sensing performance of a chemosensor. In this study the diffusion behaviour of an explosive analyte analogue into a sensing film of a conjugated dendrimer was investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and correlated with neutron reflectivity measurements. The mechanistic insights of para-nitrotoluene (pNT) sorption in the films of different thicknesses of a first generation dendrimer with fluorenyl surface groups, carbazole dendrons and a spirobifluorene core were studied and interpreted in terms of the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics. Sorption measurements suggest that the process of diffusion of pNT vapour into the dendrimer films is Super Case II, which involves swelling of the film. Swelling of the film was confirmed by neutron reflectometry, which also showed uniform distribution of the pNT molecules throughout the film. The activation energy barrier and change in Gibbs free energy in the sorption process were calculated from the QCM responses. The sorption process was found to be thermodynamically (not kinetically) controlled and independent of film thickness.

Here we focused on the discrimination of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), an explosive with military and civilian applications, using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratios. Our goal was to understand some of the factors influencing the isotope ratios of commercially manufactured PETN. PETN was isolated from bulk explosives using preparative HPLC, which reduced chemical and isotopic within-sample variability. We observed isotope ratio variation in a survey of 175 PETN samples from 22 manufacturing facilities, with δ13C values ranging from -49.7% to -28.0% and δ15N values ranging from -48.6% to +6.2%. Both within-sample variability and variation of PETN within an explosive block were much smaller than between-sample variations. Isotopic ratios of PETN were shown to discriminate explosive blocks from the same manufacturer, whereas explosive component composition measurements by HPLC were not able to do so. Using samples collected from three industrial PETN manufacturers, we investigated the isotopic relationship between PETN and its reactants, pentaerythritol (PE) and nitric acid. Our observations showed that δ13C values of PETN were indistinguishable from that of the reactant pentaerythritol. Isotopic separation between nitric acid and PETN was consistent within each sampled manufacturer but differed among manufacturers, and was likely dependent upon reaction conditions. These data indicate that δ13C variation in PETN is dependent on δ13C variation of PE supplies, while δ15N variation in PETN is due to both nitric acid δ15N and reaction conditions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84907509208"

We demonstrate here how a simple dip-coating process of a mixture of polystyrene and the fluorophore pyrene onto a glass slide generates a self-assembled fluorescent nanostructured film expressing regular breath-figure nanopores. Morphology investigation reveals that the fluorescent polymer films consist of a high-density, three-dimensional nanoporous array of holes, allowing the fluorescence of this material to be rapidly and selectively quenched by nitroaromatic vapors. The morphology of the polymer was controlled by variation of the dip-coating parameters and the ratio of polystyrene to pyrene. This ratio also controls the fluorescence quenching efficiency of the material. We demonstrate the possible molecular origins of this through structural XRD studies as well as investigations of the electronic structure (optical properties, band gap and conduction band determinations) of the polymer film.

By studying both the periodic crystal models and cluster models we obtained an in-depth understanding of the detecting mechanism from the viewpoint of electronic coupling between the analyte and sensor. Intermolecular electron transfer from the conduction bands of the framework to the LUMO of nitrobenzene is demonstrated to induce the luminescence quenching phenomenon observed in previous experiments. π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions are found to play essential roles in this intermolecular electron transfer process. π-π stacking provides large fragment orbital overlaps between the unoccupied orbitals of the analyte and sensor, which serves as a highly efficient electron transfer bridge. Hydrogen bonds alone cannot provide enough overlaps for electron transfer but are found to reinforce the π-π stacking interactions.

Without constraints, the critical diameter of emulsion explosives is 14-16. mm. Compared to the existing explosive cladding method, the consumption of explosives for steel of No. 45 to steel of Q235 and stainless steel to steel of Q235 are reduced by 83% and 77% in the case of cladding the same number of composite plates. The explosive cladding windows and collision velocity of flyer plate were calculated before experiment. It shows that the calculation prefigures exactly the explosive cladding for steel of No. 45 to steel of Q235 and stainless steel to steel of Q235. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84908134133"

The performance of the methodology was evaluated by the explained variance and the lack of fit of the models, by comparing the ICA recovered spectra with the reference spectra using correlation coefficients and by the presence of rotational ambiguity in the ICA solutions. The methodology was applied to forensic samples to solve an automated teller machine explosion case. Independent component analysis proved to be a suitable method of resolving curves, achieving equivalent performance with the multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method.

NACs are the most commonly used explosive ingredients and are common constituents of many unexploded landmines used during World War II. In this study, we have synthesised a series of pyrene-based polycarboxylic acids along with their corresponding discrete esters. Due to the electron richness and the fluorescent behaviour of the pyrene moiety, all the compounds act as sensors for electron-deficient NACs through a fluorescence quenching mechanism. A Stern-Volmer quenching constant determination revealed that the carboxylic acids are more sensitive than the corresponding esters towards NACs in solution. The high sensitivity of the acids was attributed to supramolecular polymer formation through hydrogen bonding in the case of the acids, and the enhancement mechanism is based on an exciton energy migration upon excitation along the hydrogen-bond backbone. The presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the acids in solution was established by solvent-dependent fluorescence studies and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. In addition, the importance of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in solid-state sensing was further explored by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments at the liquid-solid interface, in which structures of self-assembled monolayer of the acids and the corresponding esters were compared. The sensitivity tests revealed that these supramolecular sensors can even detect picric acid and trinitrotoluene in solution at levels as low as parts per trillion (ppt), which is much below the recommended permissible level of these constituents in drinking water. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The sublimation and decomposition enthalpy values were comparable with previously reported by another method. Amino-peroxide explosives showed a profile different from acetone-peroxide explosives. In this field of study, it is typical to calculate the vapor pressure from rate constant values using the Langmuir equation and then fit the obtained values according to Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find standard enthalpy values. The proposed method is direct because it resulted from fitting of the sublimation constant rate of (K sub) with the temperature without assuming approximated values for certain constants of the Langmuir equation.

Nanothermites have twice the energy density of 2,4,6-trinitroluene, and their nanostructures, functions, energy release, and reaction performance are continuously being improved. However, these materials suffer from low pressure because of low gas expansion from the reaction and incapability of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). Fast DDT is necessary to substantially improve the reaction velocity and output pressure not only of nanothermites but also of other monomolecular organic energetic materials, such as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and octogen. Accordingly, this study aims to produce energetic composites material that are safe, green, and free from heavy metals. A strategy of rapid DDT acceleration is proposed by fabricating quasi-core/shell structured materials of RDX@Fe2O3-Al based on Fe2O3-Al nanothermites. A surface modifying and ultrasonic synthesis technology is also demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations prove that the material comprises an RDX core and an Fe2O3-Al nanothermite shell. Results of closed vessel combustion tests show that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al combustion velocity accelerates to an average pressurization rate of 2.527MPa/μs. DDT tube tests further confirm that DDT accelerates to a primer explosive level in which the run-to-detonation distances of DDT is below the test-condition limitation (<15mm). Sensitivity tests also reveal that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite has low sensitivity to impact, friction, and electric spark. Therefore, the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite with a quasi-core/shell structure is a potential green and safe fast DDT energetic material that is easy to synthesize and applicable to other quasi-core/shell structures. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84920084561"

TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) is one of the most employed explosives in the 20th century. Despite the growing use of improvised explosives, criminal use and access to TNT is not expected to decrease. Immunoassays are simple and selective analytical tests able to detect molecules and their immunoreactions can occur in portable formats for use on-site. This work demonstrates the application of three immunochemical assays capable of detecting TNT to typical forensic samples from experimental tests: an indirect competitive ELISA with chemiluminescent detection (CL-ELISA), a colorimetric lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on colloidal gold nanoparticles label, and a chemiluminescent-LFIA (CL-LFIA). Under optimised working conditions, the LOD of the colorimetric LFIA and CL-LFIA were 1μgmL-1 and 0.05μgmL-1, respectively. The total analysis time for LFIAs was 15min. ELISA proved to be a very effective laboratory approach, showing very good sensitivity (LOD of 0.4ngmL-1) and good reproducibility (CV value about 7%).Samples tested included various materials involved in controlled explosions of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), as well as hand swabs collected after TNT handling tests. In the first group of tests, targets covered with six different materials (metal, plastic, cardboard, carpet fabric, wood and adhesive tape) were fixed on top of wooden poles (180. cm high). Samples of soil from the explosion area and different materials covering the targets were collected after each explosion and analysed. In the second group of tests, hand swabs were collected with and without hand washing after volunteers simulated the manipulation of small charges of TNT.The small amount of solution required for each assay allows for several analyses. Results of immunoassays confirmed that they were suitable to detect post-blast residues in soil and target materials and post transfer residues on hands, allowing further confirmation by more selective techniques.ELISA and LFIAs results obtained from the same solution were consistently in good agreement, and were confirmed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The reported immunoassays data demonstrates the suitability of LFIAs as on-site rapid and effective assays to detect TNT traces. The CL-ELISA proved useful in obtaining very sensitive detection in forensic investigations and testing, while CL-LFIA had performances in between LFIA and CL-ELISA. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84912017625"

Thus, the exposure of these membranes to these explosives and to 6 explosive mimics gave rise to variations in the fluorescence spectra of the materials as a function of the type of vapor and exposure time. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity recorded over the wavelength range from 381 to 575 nm and at times of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min for each of the 3 membranes had a highly defined internal structure. Thus, the principal component analysis (PCA) showed that only 3 principal components (PCs) were needed for each membrane for its description (9 PCs in total compared with the 195 wavelengths). The PCA allows for both discrimination between explosives and their mimics and for distinction between the 3 explosives. A SIMCA (soft independent modeling of class analogy) model was built using the scores from the PCs to a confidence level of 95%, which is completely specific (100%) for the vapors of each explosive and explosive mimic. Furthermore, the 3 explosive models and the model built using the 6 explosive mimics have a sensitivity of 100% and 95.8%, respectively. The modeling power and discriminant capability from the 9 PCs show that no membrane could be removed to build these models. Using a multilinear regression with the 9 PCs as predictor variables and binary responses, it was possible to model the fitted response using a normal distribution for each class (explosives and explosive mimics).

METHODS For a solid sample or surface deposit, the process entails rubbing a capillary melting tube a few times on the sample to transfer material to the capillary surface and then introducing it into the source of the mass spectrometer. Similarly, for a liquid sample, a capillary tube is dipped into the sample to just coat the surface or a few microliters may be applied to the tip of a capillary before being analyzed by Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization in both positive and negative mode. RESULTS A rodenticide containing brodifacoum, black tar heroin and its impurities (morphine, codeine, noscapine, papaverine, and monoacetylmorphine), crack cocaine and 1-methylaminoanthraquinone dyestuff were successfully analyzed directly without any sample preparation. All compounds were detected using full scan mass spectrometry (MS), followed by confirmation by MS/MS. Preliminary results suggest that this technique could be used for quantitation. CONCLUSIONS Interfacing the ASAP to an ion trap mass spectrometer allows the ability to perform full scan, MSn experiments, and rapid positive/negative switching from a single sample introduction. Because of these features, this instrument is very useful for rapid, routine analysis and for confirmation with the use of in-house MS/MS libraries. Published in 2014.

Four multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs-12, 13, 23, and 123) have been synthesized by employing ligands embedded with fluorescent tags. The multicomponent assembly of the ligands was utilized to acquire a diverse electronic behavior of the MOFs and the fluorescent tags were strategically chosen to enhance the electron density in the MOFs. The phase purity of the MOFs was established by PXRD, NMR spectroscopy, and finally by single-crystal XRD. Single-crystal structures of the MOFs-12 and 13 showed the formation of three-dimensional porous networks with the aromatic tags projecting inwardly into the pores. These electron-rich MOFs were utilized for detection of explosive nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) through fluorescence quenching with high selectivity and sensitivity. The rate of fluorescence quenching for all the MOFs follows the order of electron deficiency of the NACs. We also showed the detection of picric acid (PA) by luminescent MOFs is not always reliable and can be misleading. This attracts our attention to explore these MOFs for sensing picryl chloride (PC), which is as explosive as picric acid and used widely to prepare more stable explosives like 2,4,6-trinitroaniline from PA.

However, fundamental understanding of the sensing mechanisms on these materials is still immature and detailed investigations are needed. In this contribution, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) are applied to reveal the underlying principles for the sensing mechanism by comprehensively studying the analyte-sensor interactions. Three molecules namely nitrobenzene, benzene and acetone are chosen as analytes while a newly reported explosives-detecting LMOF [Zn2(L)(bipy)(H2O)2]·(H2O)3(DMF)2 is chosen as the sensor. Roles of two fundamental weak interactions namely hydrogen bonding interaction and π-π stacking interaction are clarified for the first time.

We find that intermolecular electron transfer is the inducement for the luminescence quenching detection of explosives. A brand new pathway for this electron transfer process is proposed for the first time. Most significantly, we discover that the hydrogen bond shows multi-functions during the detecting processes which, on the one hand, serves as the electron transfer bridge, and on the other hand, reinforces the π-π stacking. This cooperative effect of the two weak forces inside MOFs is investigated for the first time, which not only provides valuable insights into the understanding of the analyte-sensor interactions inside the sensors but also offers useful guidance in the design of MOF sensors to achieve high sensitivity.

In this paper, we describe a detailed characterization of the ANFO composition and its two main constituents (diesel and a nitrate explosive) using high resolution and accuracy mass spectrometry performed on an FT-ICR-mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI(±)-FTMS) in both the positive and negative ion modes. Via ESI(-)-MS, an ion marker for ANFO was characterized.

All IMS instruments operate with an electric field that provides space separation, but some IMS instruments also operate with a drift gas flow that provides also a temporal separation. In this review we will summarize the current IMS instrumentation. IMS techniques have received an increased interest as new instrumentation and have become available to be coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). For each of the eight types of IMS instruments reviewed it is mentioned whether they can be hyphenated with MS and whether they are commercially available. Finally, out of the described devices, the six most-consolidated ones are compared. The current review article is followed by a companion review article which details the IMS hyphenated techniques (mainly gas chromatography and mass spectrometry) and the factors that make the data from an IMS device change as a function of device parameters and sampling conditions.

The source was constructed by inserting a fused silica capillary into a stainless steel column enclosed in a glass tube. A high dc voltage was applied to a methanol solution flowing in the fused silica capillary to generate an ESI plume at the capillary tip. A high ac voltage was applied to a ring electrode attached to the glass tube to generate plasma from the nitrogen gas flowing between the glass tube and the stainless steel column. The concentric arrangement of the ESI plume and the APCI plasma in the source ensured that analytes entering the ionization region interacted with both ESI and APCI primary ion species generated in the source. Because the high voltages required for ESI and APCI were independently applied and controlled, the dual ion source could be operated in ESI-only, APCI-only, or ESI+APCI modes. Analytes were introduced into the ESI and/or APCI plumes by irradiating sample surfaces with a continuous-wavelength laser or a pulsed laser beam. Analyte ions could also be produced by directing the dual ESI+APCI source toward sample surfaces for desorption and ionization. The ionization mechanisms involved in the dual ion source include Penning ionization, ion molecule reactions, and fused-droplet electrospray ionization. Standards of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, angiotensin I, lidocaine, ferrocene, diesel, and rosemary oils were used for testing.

In both experiments, time-dependent optical emission produced by the ignited material was monitored and recorded. The heating rates achieved in the present experiments are on the order of 109--1011 Ks-1. These ignition methods result in a very fast combustion with characteristic burn times reduced by 1-3 orders of magnitude compared to the burn times measured previously for the same material ignited in the CO2 laser beam, where it was heated at a much lower rate of about 106--10 7 Ks-1.

A microwave interferometer is applied to small scale confined transient experiments, yielding time resolved characterization of a failing detonation that is initiated with an ideal explosive booster charge. Experiments were performed with ammonium nitrate and two fuel compositions (diesel fuel and mineral oil). It was observed that the failure dynamics were influenced by factors such as the chemical composition, confiner thickness, and applied shock wave strength. Thin steel walled confiners with 0.71mm wall thickness experienced detonation failure and decoupling of the shock wave from the reaction zone. Confiners with a wall thickness of 34.9mm showed a decrease in propagation speed and a steady reactive wave was achieved. Varying the applied shock strength by using an attenuator showed corresponding changes in the initial overdriven reactive wave velocity in the HMEs. The distance to detonation failure was also shown to depend on the attenuator length when thin wall confinement was used.

This work reports on the performance and characterization of direct-deposited water processed nanothermite inks on semiconductor bridge (SCB) initiators. Specifically, it investigates the replacement of nanothermites processed by resonant mixing (Resodyn LabRAM) in the solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with nanothermites processed in water. Processing safety and mixture performance were then characterized. It was found that water processed nanothermites were stable for up to 480 min in a water bath at 50°C only if both metal and metal oxide particles were coated with palmitic acid. In addition, water processed nanothermites were found to have better mixing intimacy, which resulted in better performance than nanothermite processed in DMF. Direct deposition of water processed nanothermites also mitigates electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity, while the material remains wetted, improving processing safety dramatically. For the system investigated, it was found that processing at a solids loading of 30 vol.% resulted in a high density, high performance ink that was deposited directly onto the SCBs. This resulted in a 25% reduction in the all fire threshold over traditional energetics.

A novel fluorescence method for TNT and 4-NP based on bovine serum albumin functionalized fluorescent gold nanoclusters (BSA Au-NCs) has been developed. The detection probe BSA Au-NCs can be used as a fluorescent probe for the sensitive and selective detection of TNT and 4-NP simultaneously. A good linearity of fluorescence detection using BSA Au-NCs as a fluorescent probe was observed for TNT and 4-NP concentrations in the range of 10-8-5 × 10-5 M and 10-9-5 × 10-5 M, with a detection limit of 10 nM and 1 nM, respectively. The high specificity of TNT and 4-NP with BSA Au-NCs interactions provided excellent selectivity towards detecting TNT and 4-NP over other relevant nitroaromatic compounds. This system can be applied to test strips to detect TNT and 4-NP with high sensitivity and selectivity.

The combination of electrospray multistage mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a powerful tool for the structure characterization of isomeric compounds. We show herein that resonant ion activation performed in a linear quadrupole ion trap allows the differentiation of dinitrotoluene isomers as well as aminodinitrotoluene isomers. The explosive-related compounds: 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2A-4,6-DNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4A-2,6-DNT) were analyzed by ESI-MS in the negative ion mode; they produced mainly deprotonated molecules [M-H]-. Subsequent low resolution MSn experiments provided support for fragment ion assignments and determination of consecutive dissociation pathways. Resonant activation of deprotonated dinitrotoluene isomers gave different fragment ions according to the position of the nitro and amino groups on the toluene backbone. Fragment ion identification was bolstered by accurate mass measurements performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS). Notably, unexpected results were found from accurate mass measurements performed at high resolution for 2,6-DNT where a 30-Da loss was observed that corresponds to CH2O departure instead of the expected isobaric NO• loss. Moreover, 2,4-DNT showed a diagnostic fragment ion atm/z 116, allowing the unambiguous distinction between 2,4-and 2,6-DNT isomers. Here, CH2O loss ishindered by the presence of an amino group in both 2A-4,6-DNT and 4A-2,6-DNT isomers, but nevertheless, these isomers showed significant differences in their fragmentation sequences, thus allowing their differentiation.

These highly luminescent electron-rich MOFs have been successfully utilized for the detection of explosive nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) on the basis of fluorescence quenching.

However, investigation into the aging behavior of three compositions containing polyethylene glycol and nitroglycerine revealed that the propellant which included ammonium perchlorate degraded at a slower rate compared with the other materials. It was suggested that ammonium perchlorate might act as an oxygen inhibitor reducing the oxidation rate of the polyethylene glycol binder so decreasing the rate of the propellant decomposition. In addition, at temperatures of 80°C or lower, ammonium perchlorate initially appears to hinder acid hydrolysis of nitroglycerine which also slows down the degradation of polyethylene glycol based propellant. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The screening system is based on a sampling/concentrator front end and electrochemical potentiometric gas sensor as the detector. A single sensor is operated in the dominant hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) mode by varying the sensor operating condition. The potentiometric sensor with integrated heaters was used to capture the signature of PETN. Quantitative measurements based on hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide sensor responses indicated that the detector sensitivity scaled proportionally with the mass of the explosives (10 μg down to 200 ng). The ratio of the HC integrated peak area to the NOx integrated peak area is identified as an indicator of selectivity. The HC/NOx ratio is unique for PETN and has a range from 1.7 to 2.7.

The strength limit of NEPE propellants was tested by the uniaxial tension test. Based on the aging mechanism of the micro-phase structure and the macro-mechanical properties of NEPE propellants, the aging process was divided into three stages: post curing stage, microstructure gradual degradation stage and accelerated chemical aging stage. Because nitrate ester is hardly to decompose at ambient temperatures, the post cure of NEPE propellants only occurs at higher temperatures. Thus, the life prediction of NEPE propellants should ignore the time of post cure. The service life of NEPE propellants at ambient temperatures should be determined by the second stage of high temperature accelerated aging. By analyzing the tensile strength of NEPE propellants aged at 65, 70, 75, and 80°C, the service life prediction equation of NEPE propellants was established and the service life was predicted.

A way to modify the crystal quality of an energetic material is to structure the matter on the nanoscale: the crystals size reduction should induce impurity modifications in the particles. That is one of the reasons why interest in nanoenergetic compositions that contain high energetic material (≥90 wt-%) and an organic matrix (≤10 wt-%) that takes part in constraining the explosive to organize itself on the nanoscale arose. The key point is to find or synthesize the matrix. In the course of this study, first ammonium perchlorate compositions structured on the nanoscale were synthesized (150 nm AP particles (80 wt-%) dispersed in an organogel matrix (20 wt-%)). The formulation process was based on the impregnation of porous organogels with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium perchlorate followed by freeze drying.

These AP nanocompositions show better safety behavior during combustion than there equivalent macrocompositions, while they burn more rapidly, with no degradation of their impact and thermal sensitivity properties.

We have developed a novel real-time analysis technique for explosive particles that uses a cyclone particle concentrator. This technique can analyze sample surfaces for the presence of particles from explosives such as TNT and RDX within 3 s, which is much faster than is possible by conventional methods. METHODS: Particles are detached from the sample surface with air jet pulses, and then introduced into a cyclone particle concentrator with a high pumping speed of about 80 L/min. A vaporizer placed at the bottom of the cyclone particle concentrator immediately converts the particles into a vapor. The vapor is then ionized in the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source of a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. RESULTS: An online connection between the vaporizer and a mass spectrometer enables high-speed detection within a few seconds, compared with the conventional off-line heating method that takes more than 10 s to raise the temperature of a sample filter unit. Since the configuration enriched the number density of explosive particles by about 80 times compared with that without the concentrator, a sub-ng amount of TNT particles on a surface was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: The detection limit of our technique is comparable with that of an explosives trace detector using ion mobility spectrometry. The technique will be beneficial for trace detection in security applications, because it detects explosive particles on the surface more speedily than conventional methods.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of supporting materials, including polyester, polyethylene and wood, on the detection sensitivity of a porous substrate-based negative ESI-MS technique. By using nitrobenzene derivatives and nitrophenol derivatives as the target analytes, it was found that the hydrophobic materials (i.e., polyethylene and polyester) with a higher tendency to accumulate negative charge could enhance the detection sensitivity towards nitrobenzene derivatives via electron-capture ionization; whereas, compounds with electron affinities lower than the cut-off value (1.13 eV) were not detected. Nitrophenol derivatives with pKa smaller than 9.0 could be detected in the form of deprotonated ions; whereas polar materials (i.e., wood), which might undergo competitive deprotonation with the analytes, could suppress the detection sensitivity.

In spite of the low nitramine loading in the formulation (79 wt.-%), the corresponding Gurney constant for the explosive was 2.81±0.02km s -1, which is superior to Composition A-3 under the same experimental conditions (91 % RDX, 2.69±0.02km s-1). Energy calculations from detonation calorimetry also indicate reaction of the silicon, which was further confirmed by both silicon metal and silicon dioxide in the analyzed residue. The energy release, despite it being equivalent to a highly loaded explosive, was found to lag behind the rate of A-3.

CuO and NiO enhance the burning rate, particularly at pressures lower than 1 MPa, because of the catalyzed decomposition in the condensed phase; the other additives lower the burning rate. This negative effect on the burning rate is explained based on the surface temperature measurements by a physicochemical mechanism, which involves a chemical reaction, a phase change of the ammonium nitrate, and the blown-off droplets of the condensed phase. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In these tests, the energetic materials were electrically ignited. The DDT response characteristics for PBX-2 with 53% and 99% of theoretical maximum density (TMD) were evaluated by different shell thickness confinements at ambient temperature and at 85°C. The test results with different densities, confinements and temperatures exhibited a wide range of reaction violence. Firstly, at both ambient temperature and at 85°C under 10 and 20 mm shell thickness confinement, PBX-2 did not undergo fully DDT at 99% TMD, only a low velocity detonation (LVD) occurred. Secondly, PBX-2 at 53% TMD underwent DDT, and significant influence on the minimum run distance to detonation by the shell confinement thickness was observed. Strong confinement is favorable for the transition of DDT but the confinement does not influence reaction degree. Thirdly, the reaction degree of PBX-2 at 85°C was remarkably lower than that at ambient temperature. This insensitizing effect of temperature is induced by the melting and flowing of bonders which reduces the porosity and inhibits an important step of DDT, namely, high turbulent combustion. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

DAT-B is fluorescent in the blue region, with an emission maximum at 500 nm in the solid state. Upon reaction with H2O2, DAT-B is converted to an electronic ""push-pull"" structure, diethyl 2,5-diaminoterephthalate (DAT-N), which has an emission peak at a longer wavelength centered at 574 nm. Such H2O2-mediated oxidation of aryl boronates can be accelerated through the addition of an organic base such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH), resulting in a response time of less than 0.5 s under 1 ppm of H2O2 vapor. The strong overlap between the absorption band of DAT-N and the emission band of DAT-B enables efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), thus allowing further enhancement of the sensing efficiency of H2O2 vapor.

Their chemical structures and photophysical and electrochemical properties show that the dimer P3 film has a higher molar extinction coefficient, larger steric hindrance, higher area-to-volume ratio, and matching energy level with nitrate ester explosives, which contributes to higher sensitivity and moderate selectivity for sensing of nitrate ester explosives such as nitroglycerin (NG). The fluorescence of the P3 film is rapidly about 90% quenched upon exposure to a saturated vapor of NG for 50 s and almost 100% quenched for 300 s at room temperature due to photoinduced electron transfer between the probe and analyte.

Although we discuss the chemical, explosive, and biological threat in relation to terrorism, explosives remain the weapons of choice because they have low technological and economic requirements.

From person-borne to vehicle-borne activities, law enforcement and counter-terrorism personnel have seen no end of threat situations.

Emphasis will be given to technologies presently used in forensics and airport screening, including detection of bulk quantities and trace amounts.

Separate analysis of the AN component ions ammonium and nitrate would add discriminatory power to these techniques. METHODSAmmonium ions in dissolved AN solution were isolated from samples by precipitation using sodium tetraphenylborate solution. We tested the isolation of ammonium from nitrates using solutions of ammonium and nitrate salts with different 15N/14N isotope ratios. Ammonium tetraphenylborate and AN were separately analyzed for their 15N/14N isotope ratios using EA-ConFlo-IRMS, and the 15N/14N isotope ratios of the nitrate ions were calculated using mass balance. Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen isotope ratios were plotted as two separate variables. RESULTSIsolation of ammonium precipitate from solutions containing dissolved nitrates did not influence the nitrogen isotope ratios of test ammonium salts. A survey set of 42 AN samples showed that the ammonium and nitrate 15N/14N isotope ratios were not significantly correlated, and the paired mean differences were not statistically significant. Both ammonium and nitrate were depleted in 15N relative to their theoretical atmospheric sources. CONCLUSIONSIsolation of the ammonium ion from AN adds another dimension for the discrimination of forensic AN samples. This technique using sodium tetraphenylborate is robust and does not require specialized equipment. Our observations indicated that ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen have independent sources of isotopic variation. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-84901453689"

The formation of donor-acceptor complexes between the nitro-substituted explosives, exhibiting electron-acceptor properties, and the electron-donating sites, associated with the sensing modules, concentrates the explosives in close proximity to the Ag NCs.

Particle concentration, size, melting, evaporation, and decomposition of the particles, heat and mass transfer, reaction kinetics, and heat of reaction control the burning behavior of these mixtures. A hot-spot approach models the reaction progress in three dimensions taking into consideration the particulate nature of pyrotechnic compositions. The governing reaction is assumed to be the oxidizer decomposition described by an Avrami-Erofeev model. Predominantly, the distribution of the oxidizer and fuel particles and their size for various concentrations influence the burning rate beneath the reaction kinetic parameters.

The velocity of the luminous front was measured both in the filled and unfilled region, and approached 1000 ms-1 in the unfilled region, independent of the fill length. This value is approximately a factor of two higher than the fastest velocity measured in the filled region, 606 ms -1, for the 10 cm filled tube. The velocity increase in the unfilled region ist likely due to the increased open porosity, which can support faster flow velocities for a given pressure gradient relative to that in the porous material. A high-speed color imaging pyrometer was used to thermally map the evolution of the flame in both regions. Near the luminous front in the filled section, the temperature was observed to rapidly increase in a 1-2 cm zone to a maximum value near 3200 K, and an average value near 3000 K was sustained in the wake well after the front passes and exits the tube. In partially-filled tubes, even for the lowest fill length of 2 cm, the intermediate and/or product species could be seen to expand forward and completely fill the tube with a sustained temperature of ca. 3000 K. This temperature did not decay during the expansion, suggesting that the material continues to react as it expands. The results raise several questions about what a burn tube experiment is really measuring; such as what fraction of the material has burned when the luminous front passes and what role open cracks or microstructures play in promoting transport. These questions are critically important towards developing a predictive capability for confined, loosely packed deflagrations. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Historically there has been evidence that the surface properties of PETN particles can be strongly influenced by the presence of homolog impurities of PETN, in particular, dipentaerythritol hexanitrate (diPEHN) and tripentaerythritol octanitrate (triPEON), although not many systematic studies characterizing such influence exist. In this work we employ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to measure mass-loss rates at elevated temperatures and show that doping with a small amount of diPEHN and triPEON can reduce the mass-loss rate from PETN single-crystal surfaces by as much as 35 % as compared to undoped crystals. Arrhenius plots of mass-loss rates as a function of temperature suggest that the reduction in evaporation is not due to the change in activation barrier of the molecular evaporation process, but perhaps due to the impedance to the receding motion of the steps by the immobile impurities on the surface. Removal of surface impurities through gentle washing with ethanol leads to enhanced mass-loss rate relative to pure PETN suggesting a roughened surface morphology. Some surface roughening in doped crystals is supported by Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of growth layers that show evidences of growth layer stacking and rough edges. We also find that a larger amount of impurity added to the original solution does not necessarily lead to a more highly doped crystal, which could perhaps be interpreted as PETN crystals being able to accommodate only up to a certain weight percent of homolog impurities.

The current study involved the determination of slightly polar and nonpolar explosives in water with a reversed phase sorbent followed by high performance liquid chromatography. The method was based on a styrene divinylbenzene sorbent loosely placed inside a 5-mL pipette tip. Water samples were drawn into the tip and mixed with the sorbent. Air bubbles were also drawn through the tip following sample solution to enhance mixing. Because disposable pipette extraction uses small amounts of sorbent, minimal solvent is required to elute analytes and solvent evaporation is not necessary. The method provided rapid sample preparation, and required less than five minutes to extract 1.0 mL of water sample in the current study. Matrix-matched calibration was performed, and the limits of detection (LOD) were determined to be below 0.1 μg mL-1 for all targeted explosives in water with an enrichment factor of two. Coefficients of determination (r2) were greater than 0.9990 for all studied explosives, and the recoveries ranged from 69.76% to 87.51%, 83.77% to 91.25%, and 83.62% to 98.99% for samples spiked at 0.25 μg mL-1, 1.0 μg mL-1, and 5.0 μg mL-1, respectively.

However, this equation was derived for very ductile casings that are accelerated to their ideal Gurney velocity before they fracture. A previous paper [3] showed how the finite fracture strain of real casing metal can be taken into account in determining the relative blast impulse from a cased charge.

Two ignition modes were detected: immediate ignition of individual particles and delayed ignition of a cloud of aerosolized powder. Experiments addressed the effects of material composition and morphology, aging, energy input, layer thickness, and environment on the ignition mode and ignition delays. Prepared thermites were blended with pure metal powders to study ignition of such blends. Individual particle ignition was observed for samples prepared as monolayers in air and argon and for any samples in vacuum. For thicker samples in air and in argon, a delayed powder ignition mode was observed. The delays varied from 10 μs to several milliseconds. Powders of 2Al-3CuO had shorter ignition delays compared with 8Al-MoO3. For both materials, delays decreased for the powders prepared using longer milling times. For 2Al-3CuO, aged powders ignited after longer delays compared with the freshly prepared powders; however, shorter delays were observed for the aged 8Al-MoO3. Electrostatic discharge energy and layer thickness (except for a monolayer) did not affect the ignition delay. Blending nanocomposite thermites with Al and Ti powders reduced their electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity and caused longer ignition delays.

Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has proven to be a key analytical technique in the detection of trace explosive material. Unfortunately, IMS alone does not provide chemical identification of the ions detected; therefore, it is unknown what ion species are actually formed and separated by the IMS. In IMS, ions are primarily characterized by their drift time, which is dependent on the ions mass and molecular cross-section; thus, IMS as a standalone technique does not provide structural signatures, which is in sharp contrast to the chemical and molecular information that is generally obtained from other customary analytical techniques, such as NMR, Raman and IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. To help study the ion chemistry that gives rise to the peaks observed in IMS, the hardware of two different commercial IMS instruments has been directly coupled to triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, in order to ascertain each ions corresponding mass/charge (m/z) ratios with different dopants at two temperatures. Isotope labeling was then used to help identify and confirm the molecular identity of the explosive fragment and adduct ions of TATP. The m/z values and isotope labeling experiments were used to help propose probable molecular formulas for the ion fragments. In this report, the fragment and adduct ions m/z 58 and 240 of TATP have been confirmed to be [C3H6NHH]+ and [TATPNH4]+, respectively; while the fragment ions m/z 73 and 89 of TATP are identified as having the molecular formulas [C 4H9NH2]+ and [C4H 9O2]+, respectively.

The two-dimensional model is constructed in full two-phase, and based on a highly coupled system of partial differential equations involving basic flow conservation equations and some constitutive relations borrowed from some one-dimensional studies that appeared in open literature. The whole system is solved using an optimized high-order accurate, explicit, central-difference scheme with selective-filtering/shock capturing (SF-SC) technique, to augment central-diffencing and prevent excessive dispersion. The sources of the equations describing particle-gas interactions in terms of momentum and energy transfers make the equation system quite stiff, and hence its explicit integration difficult. To ease the difficulties, a time-split approach is used allowing higher time steps. In the paper, the physical model for the sources of the equation system is given for a typical explosive, and several numerical calculations are carried out to assess the developed code. Microscale intergranular and/or intragranular effects including pore collapse, sublimation, pyrolysis, etc. are not taken into account for ignition and growth, and a basic temperature switch is applied in calculations to control ignition in the explosive domain. Results for one-dimensional DDT phenomenon are in good agreement with experimental and computational results available in literature.

Public transportation has been around for about 150 years, but terroristic attacks against buses, trains, subways, etc., is a relatively recent phenomenon [1]. Since 1970, transportation has been an increasingly attractive target for terrorists. Most of the attacks to transport infrastructures take place in countries where public transportation is the primary way to move. Terrorists prefer to execute a smaller-scale attack with certainty of success rather than a complex and demanding operation to cause massive death and destruction. [1]. Many commonly available materials, such as fertilizer, gunpowder, and hydrogen peroxide, can be used as explosives and other materials, such as nails, glass, or metal fragments, can be used to increase the amount of shrapnel propelled by the explosion. The majority of substances that are classified as chemical explosives generally contain oxygen, nitrogen and oxidable elements such as carbon and hydrogen [2]. The most common functional group in military explosives is NO2. That functionality can be attached to oxygen (ONO2) in the nitrate esters (PETN), to carbon (C-NO2) in the nitroarenes (TNT) and nitroalkanes (Nitromethane), and to nitrogen (N-NO2) as in the nitramines (RDX). Some organic peroxides, such as TATP and HMTD, are popular amongst terrorists because they are powerful initiators that can be easily prepared from easily available ingredients. Azides are also powerful primary explosives commonly used as initiators (commercial detonators) in civilian and military operations, therefore they could be potentially used by terrorists as initiators for IEDs. © 2014 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84905841258"

The isotopic characterization of an explosive can be a powerful approach to link evidence to an event or an explosives cache. We sampled explosive products and their reactants from commercial RDX manufacturers that used the direct nitration and/or the Bachmann synthesis process, and then analyzed these materials for carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. For manufacturers using the Bachmann process, RDX 13C enrichment relative to the hexamine substrate was small (+0.9‰) compared to RDX produced using the direct nitration process (+8.2‰ to +12.0‰). RDX 15N depletion relative to the nitrogen-containing substrates (-3.6‰) was smaller in the Bachmann process than in the direct nitration process (-12.6‰ to -10.6‰). The sign and scale of these differences agree with theorized mechanisms of mass-dependent fractionation. We also examined the isotopic relationship between RDX and HMX isolated from explosive samples. The δ13C and δ15N values of RDX generally matched those of the HMX with few exceptions, most notably from a manufacturer known to make RDX using two different synthesis processes. The range in δ13C values of RDX in a survey of 100 samples from 12 manufacturers spanned 33‰ while the range spanned by δ15N values was 26‰ these ranges were much greater than any previously published observations. Understanding the relationship between products and reactants further explains the observed variation in industrially manufactured RDX and can be used as a diagnostic tool to analyze explosives found at a crime scene. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84899791043"

Via the 980 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, these nanosensors emit strong white UC luminescence with five typical emission peaks centered at 363, 455, 475, 546, and 654 nm. The UC emission at both 363 and 546 nm was quenched by the addition of TNT; however, the ratio of luminescence intensity at 363 nm to 546 nm (I363/I546) had no change with the increase of TNT concentration. Meanwhile, only violet UC emission at 363 nm was dramatically quenched via the addition of TNP, and the I363/I 546 ratio is negatively proportional to the TNP concentration in the range of 0.01-4.5 μg/mL of TNP.

Less-sensitive ingredients in both explosives and propellants will ensure the protection of deployed troops against an unwanted reaction to an external stimulus on the munitions stockpile.

Various formulations, mainly based on DNAN and NTO, have been developed and are now being fielded. Our research goal is to measure the deposition rate of energetics compounds from various insensitive munitions detonation scenarios. Our hypothesis is that the relative insensitiveness of these formulations leads to slightly higher deposition rates than conventional explosive formulations. This paper describes detonation residues research on mortar rounds containing IMX-104 explosive. Analyses indicate that high-order detonation residues are slightly greater for this formulation than for conventional munitions. However, blow-in-place detonations (BIPs) resulted in much higher residues deposition, indicating that a larger donor charge is required for efficient detonation.

The structure, sensitivity, polymorph properties, and thermal behavior of CL-20/TATB by coating and physical mixing were studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that submicrometer-sized TATB was compactly coated onto the CL-20 surface with coverage close to 100 %. The core-shell structure of CL-20/TATB was confirmed by observation of hollow TATB shell from the CL-20 core dissolved sample. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the polymorph of CL-20 maintained ε form during the whole preparing process. Thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), showing effects of TATB coating on the polymorph thermal stability and exothermic decomposition of CL-20. Both the impact and friction sensitivities were markedly reduced due to the cushioning and lubricating effects of TATB shell. The preparation of explosive composites with core-shell structure provides an efficient route for the desensitization of high explosives, such as CL-20 in this study.

There were two main purposes of this research: (1) develop effective laboratory methods for detecting drugs and explosives in fingermark residues and (2) determine the feasibility of detecting drugs and explosives after casual contact with pills, powders, and residues. Further, synthetic latent print reference pads were evaluated as mimics of natural fingermark residue to determine if the pads could be used for method development and quality control.The results suggest that artificial amino acid and sebaceous oil residue pads are not suitable to adequately simulate natural fingermark chemistry for MALDI/TOF MS analysis. However, the pads were useful for designing experiments and setting instrumental parameters. Based on the natural fingermark residue experiments, handling whole or broken pills did not transfer sufficient quantities of drugs to allow for definitive detection. Transferring drugs or explosives in the form of powders and residues was successful for preparing analytes for detection after contact with fingers and deposition of fingermark residue. One downfall to handling powders was that the analyte particles were easily spread beyond the original fingermark during development. Analyte particles were confined in the original fingermark when using transfer residues.The MALDI/TOF MS was able to detect procaine, pseudoephedrine, TNT, and RDX from contact residue under laboratory conditions with the integration of conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix.

One major shortcoming of current explosive models is the lack of chemical kinetics data of the reacting explosive at the high pressures and temperatures experienced under detonation conditions. In the absence of experimental data, long time-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with reactive chemistry provide insight into the decomposition mechanisms of explosives and allow us to obtain effective reaction rates. These rates can then be incorporated into a thermochemical continuum code for accurate and predictive description of grain- and continuum-scale dynamics of reacting explosives. During the course of the past decade, we have examined the chemistry of several reacting explosive materials, such as the high-performing HMX and the very insensitive TATB explosives, both of which are organic molecular solids at ambient conditions. We have used quantum-based, self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method to calculate the interatomic forces in molecular dynamics simulations either for thermal decomposition studies (constant volume-temperature) or dynamical shock studies using the multiscale shock simulation technique (MSST).

We show the main analytical techniques and methodologies used to determine consumer fireworks. Most articles published to date focused on studying characteristics and properties of pyrotechnic reagents and explosive compositions by thermal techniques. However, a few research papers focused on the determination of chemical reagents from intact devices or their residues. In this review, we critically review colorimetric tests, and microscopy, spectroscopy, separation and potentiometric techniques.

However, the inclusion of liquid NG presents both stability and performance problems: the NG may migrate from the propellant in storage, and it softens the propellant at high inclusion levels. In this work, the novel nitrate ester 1,4-dinitrato-2,3-dinitro-2,3bis(nitratomethylene) butane (SMX) is considered as a replacement for NG in a double base propellant. Thermochemical calculations indicate improved performance when compared with the common double base propellant JA2 at SMX loadings above 40 wt-%. Also, since SMX is a room temperature solid, migration may be mitigated. Both unplasticized and plasticized propellants were formulated to enable the study of the interaction of SMX with nitrocellulose. Thermal analysis of unplasticized propellant showed a distinct melt-recrystallization curve, which indicates that a solid phase solution is being formed between SMX and NC, and that SMX would not act as plasticizer. Analysis of propellant prepared with diethyleneglycol dinitrate (DEGDN) plasticizer indicates that the SMX is likely dissolved in the DEGDN. The plasticized material also showed similar hardness and modulus to JA2. Safety characterization showed that sensitivity is similar to JA2. In short, replacing NG with SMX results in a new family of propellants with acceptable safety characteristics and which may also offer improved theoretical performance. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) shows the self-sensitized FOX-7 becomes multiple layers and porous after heat treatment. N2 adsorbance measurements revealed that its specific surface area (6.754 m2g -1) is 20 times of the area of expanded ammonium nitrate. The SAXS tests further indicate the existence of a large amount of voids in self-sensitized FOX-7 and the pore size is about 30 nm, belonging to mesopore (2.0-50 nm). Based on the analysis of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), the self-sensitized porous FOX-7 consists of α-phase and a spot of γ-phase. The TG-DSC results show that the self-sensitized FOX-7 exhibits excellent thermal stability. The impact, frication and electrostatic spark sensitivities of self-sensitized FOX-7 also have considerable enhancement.

Results have shown that thin films of both polymers display remarkably high sensitivity and selectivity toward these analytes. Very fast, reproducible, and reversible responses were found. The unique behavior of these supramolecular host systems is ascribed to cooperativity effects developed between the calix[4]arene hosts and the phenylene ethynylene-carbazolylene main chains. The calix[4]- arene hosts create a plethora of host-guest binding sites along the polymer backbone, either in their bowl-shaped cavities or between the outer walls of the cavity, to direct guests to the area of the transduction centers (main chain) at which favorable photoinduced electron transfer to the guest molecules occurs and leads to the observed fluorescence quenching. The high tridimensional porous nature of the polymers imparted by the bis-calixarene moieties concomitantly allows fast diffusion of guest molecules into the polymer thin films. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Peak pressure, impulse, shock energy, and bubble energy were obtained by analyzing the curves. The results show that the peak pressures of composite explosives decrease with increasing aluminum fiber contents. The shock impulse of the 30% aluminum fiber composite explosive is the highest in all composite explosives. The effects of the 20% and 40% composite explosives are nearly equal to that of the 30% explosive, and the different values of shock impulse among them do not exceed 5%. The specific shock energy of the 20% aluminum fiber composite explosive is the highest in all composite explosives.

In this work, a red emissive phosphorescent iridium(III) complex was synthesized and used for TNT sensing. The obtained iridium(III) complex is highly emissive, and the PL response of the complex in solution toward TNT was researched by examining the steady state emission intensity to the concentration of TNT. Efficient PL quenching was obtained when TNT was added to the detection solution. The long excited-state lifetime of obtained phosphorescent complex is beneficial for interaction with TNT molecules. In addition, suitable matching of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the iridium(III) complex with TNT also benefits the electron transfer from the complex to TNT molecules and enhances the PL quenching. As a small molecular material, the obtained phosphorescent complex shows comparable PL quenching efficiency to TNT with reported conjugated polymers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84899624389"

Various rocket parameters of each formulation were theoretically predicted by the NASA CEC-71 program and the burning rate was evaluated in pressure range of 3-11 MPa. In addition, density, sensitivity, and thermal properties of compositions having maximum effects on pressure exponent's values were also evaluated. It was concluded that ZrSiO4 enhances the pressure exponent ""n"" value substantially, whereas ZrC doesn't have significant effects on it as compared to base composition and also provides higher density values of composite propellant formulated. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The main Raman features of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine were clearly identified, and a careful optimization of acquisition parameters was performed in order to increase the overall sensitivity of the apparatus. The amount of the sampled substance was determined through the analysis of high-resolution scanning electron microscope images of the substrate covered with the residual explosive and resulted to be of the order of few tens of picograms.
