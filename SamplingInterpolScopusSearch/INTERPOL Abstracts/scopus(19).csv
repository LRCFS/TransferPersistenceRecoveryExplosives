Many of the advantages of µPADs, however, are limited to work in a laboratory setting due to the difficulties of processing data when using electronic devices in the field. This review focuses on the use of µPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The µPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85050459634"

The safety of working with these materials in the laboratory is the greatest limiting factor preventing HME research. A vapor delivery tool, the Mixed Vapor Generation Device (MV-Gen), was designed to safely contain the individual solid or liquid components that often compose homemade explosives vapor plumes and deliver the mixed component vapors for instrumental sampling and analysis. Within the MV-Gen, each component is separated and only the vapors mix as they are carried through the device by flowing air. The resulting mixed vapor is representative of either mixed explosive material or bulk explosives. Component materials are held in up to four individual, removable vials with vapor concentrations controlled by vial orifice size, temperature, and diluent airflow. The total concentration can be adjusted by altering vial temperature via a thermal water jacket surrounding the entirety of the device, or by adjusting the flow rate of diluent air through the device. The MV-Gen was evaluated first with surrogate compounds, followed by two types of homemade explosives, to include a binary explosive mixture and a peroxide explosive. To evaluate the device, vapors were cold-trapped on an online sampling system and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was determined that the device yielded reproducible vapor concentrations of both single and mixed components, and the ratio of these vapors can be easily adjusted to mimic varying forms of homemade explosives. © 2018","2-s2.0-85049984452"

Several configurations of an Explosives Detection System (EDS) to intercept hidden threats, made up with a Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) compact neutron generator and NaI (Tl) scintillation detectors, have been evaluated using MCNP6 code. The system's response to various samples of explosives, such as RDX and Ammonium Nitrate, is analysed. The D-D generator is able to produce fast neutrons with 2.5 MeV energy in a maximum yield of 1010 n/s. It is surrounded by high-density polyethylene to thermalize the fast neutrons and to optimize interactions with the sample inspected, whose emission of gamma rays gives a characteristic spectrum of the elements that constitute it. This procedure allows to determine its chemical composition and to identify the type of substance. The necessary shielding is evaluated to estimate its thicknesses depending on the admissible dose of operation, using lead and polyethylene.

The unsolved problems are how can we detect drug, TATP and nitro aromatic explosives with the same device, how can we distinguish different explosives and drugs, and how can we avoid false alarms; solving these problems are crucial for world security. We have developed a new synthetic conjugated polymer with single molecule layer and coated on porous silicon with large surface area to increase quenching signal at least one order, based on this new film a small handheld explosive detector with sensitivities of 0.1 pg for TNT and 0.1 ng for black gun powder are obtained. Many explosives and drugs (such as TNT, RDX, PETN, black gun powder, cocaine, etc.) have been tested, from their quenching curves and our data base we are able to distinguish them qualitatively and avoid false alarms. Therefore we believe our detector can be used not only for battle field but also for airports, government entrances and other security check points. Last year, after face to face competition, our device was selected as the only security detector for the G20 summit held in Hangzhou, China.

The obtained coordination compounds were characterized using low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction (except 14), IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and DTA (except 16). The sensitivities toward external stimuli (impact and friction) were determined according to the Bundesamt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM) standard methods together with its sensitivities against electrostatic discharge (except 16).

No significant correlation between the oxidation properties of the n-Me powders and the combustion properties of propellants was discovered. An addition of nanopowders caused an increase in the propellant burning rate by approximately 30 % for n-Al, n-B, n-Ni, and n-Mo independent from the pressure values. An addition of n-Cu resulted in a burning rate increase by a factor of 4.9 due to coppers’ probable catalytic activity during interaction with nitroesters and cyclic nitramines in a solid phase. n-Zn additive increased the propellant burning rate by factors 2.3 and 3.6 at 4 and 10 MPa, respectively, due to catalytic activity of zinc in a gaseous phase. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Its modelling is instrumental for the accurate prediction of the performance of these explosives. Because of the high temperature of detonation products, the chemical reactions are mixing-driven. Modelling afterburning thus relies on the precise description of the mixing process inside fireballs. This work presents a joint numerical and experimental study of a non-reacting reduced-scale set-up, which uses the compressed balloon analogy and does not involve the detonation of a high explosive. The set-up produces a flow similar to the one caused by a spherical detonation and allows focusing on the mixing process. The numerical work is composed of 2D and 3D LES simulations of the set-up. It is shown that grid independence can be reached by imposing perturbations at the edge of the fireball. The results compare well with the existing literature and give new insights on the mixing process inside fireballs. In particular, they highlight the fact that the mixing layer development follows an energetic scaling law but remains sensitive to the density ratio between the detonation products and air. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85042419525"

The pulses were produced by the impact of thin plastic flyer plates, which were accelerated by electrically exploded metal foils. Nano-TATB powders with a mean particle size of 60 nm were prepared and pressed into cylindrical sample charges with three densities (1.56, 1.64 and 1.74 g/cm                             3                             ). The flyer impact velocity data versus charging voltages was measured with different flyer thicknesses. Together with the Hugoniot relationships of flyer and samples, the impact pressures and pulse durations were calculated. By using Langlie method, the threshold pressures for shock initiation were determined. In case of the identical flyer plate, the threshold pressure increases with increasing density. In case of the identical explosive density, the threshold pressure increases as the thickness of the flyer decreases (i. e. the pulse duration decreases) except for the highest tested density. These data are represented well by a constant P                             2                             τ initiation criterion for the short, high-pressure pulses and deviate from the P                             2                             τ behavior at lower pressures.

However, the inherent mechanisms of such stabilization effects are still not well-known. Herein, various transition metal complexes of triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN) using GO as a dopant have been prepared and evaluated. It has been shown that the presence of GO could great improve the thermal stability of the resulted TAG-based complexes. The physical models governing their thermolysis for their initial rate-limiting decomposition steps are obtained using the state-of-the-art evaluation methods. These physical models are further supported by analyses of the overall gaseous products. In addition, the reaction pathways are proposed to explain the stabilization mechanisms of GO. For instance, by interaction of GO, the release of N2 from TAG-Ni was greatly postponed. There is a broad secondary peak at temperature of 378 °C due to decomposition of the nickel nitrides, as the primary thermolysis intermediates of TAG-Ni. The formation of cobalt nitrides plays a significant role on decomposition of TAG-Co and G-T-Co, which results in much less heat release and mass loss in comparison to TAG-Ni. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85060440980"

TEX has high application value in casting and press-packed explosives. A TEX supercell model was constructed using the reaction molecular dynamics (MD) method. Based on the ReaxFF/lg reactive force field, an MD simulation of the thermal decomposition process of TEX explosives at different temperatures (2000 K, 2500 K, 3000 K, and 3500 K) was performed. The calculations were carried out to analyze the initial reaction pathways, small molecule products, destruction of the TEX cage structure and formation of clusters. The structural characteristics and elemental composition of the clusters were studied, and the reaction kinetic parameters of TEX at different reaction stages were calculated. During the thermal decomposition process, the N–NO2 bond in the TEX molecular structure breaks first, then the adjacent C–O bond is stretched, and finally the cage structure is gradually destroyed. The main decomposition products are small molecules (NO2, NO, H2O, CO2, N2, H2, HNO2 and HNO) and clusters (C12H12N6O12 and C18H13N7O14). The effect of temperature on the clusters is twofold. On the one hand, when the temperature is low, the cage structure of the TEX molecule is difficult to destroy and is not conducive to cluster growth. On the other hand, when the temperature is high, clusters are generated in the TEX supercell system but are subsequently rapidly decomposed. Throughout the whole process, H, N and O will gradually escape from the cluster, but O is more confined to the cluster, which will affect the subsequent autoxidation process of TEX to some extent. © 2019 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85060954789"

Suffering from the small Raman scattering efficiency, this system perusing large detection distance requires both large power consumption and optical system, which blocks its applications. In order to seek for high signal collection efficient, in this work, we designed a 2-inch refractive telescope system, and obtained 20 m detection distance using a frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd: YAG laser with pulse energy of 30 mJ. By adjusting the excitation energy through a variable attenuator, we investigate the interrelations of input power, the signal and the noise consisting of the internal and signal-induced noises. For both main peak and sub peak, the signal-induced noises are subject to a power function of the signal intensity, and can be filtered and smoothed by the norm-distribution-function weighted moving average method (WMAM) without the loss of the signal information. After transforming the correlation spectrum, defined by the multiplication of the noise and signal spectrum, iteratively by WMAM, we can identify the small signal of about 1 count beyond the internal noise limitation.

As the proof of concept, the copper azide film is further assembled in a micro-initiation device, which can successfully detonate the secondary explosives CL-20. Additionally, the superhydrophobic surface of the CA-C film@PF merit the initiation power even after being soaked in water.                          © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85062372759"

This work proposes an innovative hybridized instrument to simultaneously obtain molecular and elemental information on an analyte. The instrument was designed in a compact form due to the integration of a modularized structure and a single unified control system, which was ultimately restricted to a size of 420 mm × 520 mm × 650 mm, suitable for field applications. An orthogonal optical system was used to focus the laser beams and obtain the spectra and real-time imaging of the tested area. A pulsed laser (1064 nm, 100 mJ, 1–20 Hz) and a continuous-wave laser (532 nm, 22 mW) were applied for LIBS and Raman measurements, respectively. The multichannel original equipment manufactured spectrometer ensures a wide spectral range (185–850 nm for LIBS and 400–4000 cm                             −1                              for Raman) on the basis of its low weight. A central control circuit board was specially developed by integrating the control command and data transmission to achieve centralized control of the components, thereby providing precise timing control and improving the instrument. The enclosed sample chamber had the function of mapping and shielding the fill gas. The developed client software provided a comprehensive operation interface.

Results revealed that the thermal decomposition behavior has been significantly influenced in the presence of Al and HTPB matrix, especially reducing the thermal stability than that of neat HMX.

Fluorescence sensors are prevalent for sensitive and fast in-field explosive detection but are sometimes compromised by accuracy and stability due to the similar structures of explosives, photobleaching, and complex sample matrixes. Herein, we developed a first bimodal methodology capable of both sensitive in-field fluorescence detection and accurate laboratory mass spectrometric quantification of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) by utilizing the characteristic fluorescent and mass spectrometric response of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). An excellent selectivity was also realized by involving aptamer recognition.

Additional utility of this information may suggest human toxicity and possibly detection of biomarkers, metabolites or intact molecule of those using this material for nefarious reasons. Methods: Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of dog liver microsome (DLM) incubation samples of TATP was used to measure substrate depletion. Trapping of electrophilic products was performed using glutathione (GSH) and semicarbazide. Comparisons were made to free hydroperoxides found in methyl ethyl ketone peroxides (MEKP). Results: The non-specific K                             m                              value of 2.2 μM and a V                             max                              of 1.1 nmol/min/mg of protein were determined. Canine recombinant cytochrome P450 (rCYP) 2B11 with human cytochrome b5 was found to catalyze the NADPH-dependent metabolism of TATP into its only phase I metabolite, hydroxy-TATP (TATP-OH). No secondary metabolite(s) or degraded products were detected or trapped from microsomal incubations. MEKP subjected to similar conditions was found to undergo significant metabolism, semicarbazide trapping and rapid oxidation of GSH to GSSG. The synthesized TATP-OH metabolite incubated in DLM progressed three times faster than TATP metabolism with no secondary metabolites found or trapped. Conclusions: TATP does not react as MEKP suggesting that TATP does not ring-open to form hydroperoxides. TATP and TATP-OH compete for the same enzyme, with TATP dominating this competition. Failure to detect additional metabolite(s) suggests they may be too small to detect by our system or bound covalently to a protein or polymer in the incubation reaction.                          © 2018, Japanese Association of Forensic Toxicology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85056322399"

Second, the relationships between the average abundance of 14C and the age of the explosive, the spatial distribution of the 14C abundance in the explosive were calculated by using the JMCT software. Finally, it is found that, compared to the WgPu warheads (nuclear warheads with weapons-grade plutonium cores), the 14C abundances of the explosives of the WgU warheads (nuclear warheads with weapons-grade uranium cores) are much lower (the ages of the explosives are the same), and it is more difficult to measure the latter; for the WgPu warheads with the structures based on Model 3 and Model 4 (the warhead models employed were proposed by Steve Fetter), it can be determined that whether the separated explosives come from the dismantled nuclear warheads or are common ones (or the fake ones prepared by the verified party) after the dismantlement of the nuclear warheads by measuring the 14C abundances in the explosives (including the average abundances and the spatial distributions of the abundances) and determining the ages of the explosives, which realizes the source authentication of the explosives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85055262424"

Modified DB propellant based on energetic nitramines (RDX) can offer enhanced thrust and action time. This study is devoted to evaluate the impact of RDX on chemical stability and shelf life of DB propellant. Extruded modified DB propellant based on RDX was manufactured by solventless extrusion process. Shelf life assessment was performed using an artificial aging at 70 °C up to 120 days and employing Van't Hoff's formula. Quantification of evolved NOx gases and stabilizer depletion with aging time was conducted using Bergmann-Junk test and HPLC respectively. Modified DB formulation based on RDX 20 wt % demonstrated enhanced chemical stability and extended service life up to 46 years compared with reference formulation. This finding was ascribed to the high chemical and thermal stability of RDX as well as its compatibility with DB constituents; no side chemical reactions could take place during storing.

The underlying principle is to use D-T (14.1 MeV) neutrons tagged by its associated charged particle and incorporating neutron time-of-flight technique to identify explosives by estimating carbon, nitrogen and oxygen contents and their ratios. This research was carried out to facilitate the design and construction of a prototype laboratory based TNM system and a simulation model was developed in the GEANT4 framework. The model has established an environment for (a) simulating production of D-T tagged neutrons, their transport and interactions with an object to induce emission, detection of characteristic gamma-rays and (b) image reconstruction (3D) of the interrogated object using time-of-flight information of neutron and gamma-ray. The geometrical configuration includes 14.1 MeV tagged neutrons, a position sensitive alpha detector and an array of BGO (3” x 3”) gamma detectors arranged in a square geometry around the sample to collect the neutron induced gamma-ray spectra. With this configuration of tagged neutron system, a reference data set of pure elements’ (C, O, N, Al and Fe) neutron induced gamma energy spectra was generated. Simulated spectra of benign (urea, melamine) and explosive (RDX, TNT, ammonium nitrate) samples were analyzed and their elemental compositions of C, N and O were extracted with linear combination of reference data set. The resulting compositions were found to be close to the actual values. Further, the effects of the matrix materials on energy spectra of sample were studied with explosive (1 kg RDX) hidden inside a small container filled with (1) metallic matrix composed of iron (                             56                             Fe) or (2) organic matrix (C                             2.59                             H                             5.05                             N                             0.55                             O                             1.6                             ) with an average densities of 0.1, 0.2 g/cc.

The first method of encoding information about an explosive was simply writing desired information on the explosive's packaging. Marking explosives in this way can be considered the first identification taggant. Identification taggants that encode information have evolved over the course of over 100 years in the United States. Identification taggants are particularly useful as they allow explosives to be tracked back to the manufacturer and purchaser. Correlations can be seen in the evolutional advances in identification taggants and events (wars and terrorist activities) that lead to regulations governing explosives. The information presented in this paper walks through the evolution of identification taggants, since 1917, and identifies the corresponding event that led to increased regulations governing explosives. The paper illustrates that the efforts in identification taggants have been primarily reactionary and highlights the need for a more proactive approach in taggant research and implementation. Understanding the previously developed identification taggants has led to successive generations of taggant candidates, including a modern candidate known as the Nuclear Barcode. The nuclear barcode focuses on allowing identification taggant to survive the detonation process intact, prevent counterfeiting or obscuration, enhance forensic detection of explosives, as well as providing a sufficiently large number of potential codes to enable labeling individual batches of product. The nuclear barcode is designed to accomplish these goals inexpensively while also not affecting the properties or sensitivity of the tagged explosive. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Prior research has suggested that the chemical and or perceptual similarity of components in a mixture may influence whether they can be detected individually; however, how experience and training influence the ability to identify individual components in complex mixtures (a figure-background segregation) is less clear. Figure-background segregation is a critical task for dogs tasked with discriminating between Home Made Explosives and very similar, but innocuous, complex odor mixtures. In a cross-over experimental design, we evaluated the effect of two training procedures on dogs’ ability to identify the presence of a critical oxidizer in complex odor mixtures. In the Mixture training procedure, dogs received odor mixtures that varied from trial to trial with and without an oxidizer. In the more typical procedure for canine detection training, dogs were presented with the pure oxidizer only, and had to discriminate this from decoy mixtures (target-only training). Mixture training led to above chance discrimination of the oxidizer from variable backgrounds and dogs were able to readily generalize performance, with no decrement, to mixtures containing novel odorants. Target-only training, however, led to a precipitous drop in hit rate when the oxidizer was presented in a mixture background containing either familiar and/or novel odorants. Furthermore, by giving Target-only trained dogs Mixture training, they learned to identify the oxidizer in mixtures. Together, these results demonstrate that training method has significant impacts on the perception of components in odor mixtures and highlights the importance of olfactory learning for the effective detection of Home Made Explosives by dogs. © 2018 The Authors","2-s2.0-85057526749"

The criterion is employed to distinguish between two different propagation modes of one-dimensional (1-D) freely propagating premixed flames, that is the canonical deflagration wave controlled by heat and species back-diffusion, which features a unique flame speed, and the auto-ignition controlled reaction front propagation, which may feature an arbitrary propagation speed. In the CEMA based diagnostic, the local chemistry and diffusion source terms are projected to the chemical explosive mode (CEM), such that the roles of diffusion and chemistry in the CEM can be quantified and compared for identification of the flame propagation mode. The new criterion is further applied to analyze two-dimensional (2-D) DNS datasets of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion of n-heptane/air with different levels of thermal stratification. Both flame propagation modes are observed and contribute significantly to the overall flame burning in the case with a high level of thermal stratification, while the flame propagation is found dominated by the auto-ignition mode in the case with a low level of thermal stratification, which agrees with the finding in previous studies. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.","2-s2.0-85050888180"

Interaction energies ranged from ?18 to ?14 kJ/mol and highly directional halogen bonding interactions were observed with bond distances ranging between 3.0 and 3.4 Å. In all geometry optimized structures, the sigma-hole of electropositive potential on the halogen aligned with a lone pair of electrons on the nitro-moiety of the explosive. The computational results predict that the strongest interactions will occur with iodine-based sensors as, of all the halogens studied, iodine is the largest, most polarizable halogen with the smallest electronegativity.

Furthermore, mercury lamp was employed to represent the outdoor environment. The reflected and emitted light of each tested explosive material was collected using hyperspectal camera to generate cubic images.

The apparatus is made of commonly available parts, and does not require specialist expertise to safely operate. However, the handling of sensitive organic peroxides like TATP requires caution. Guidance is also offered about approaches to consider including risk control measures to effectively and safely mitigate risks associated with destroying sensitive organic peroxides in emergency settings. © 2018 Division of Chemical Health and Safety of the American Chemical Society","2-s2.0-85048886347"

Results indicate that the quadruple point is at the center where four shock waves collide, and the double point is between two initiation points where two shock waves collide. When the height of donor explosive exceeds 5 mm, the retardation time of the quadruple point compared to the double point and the individual point are 180 ns and 260 ns, respectively.

Many pure and composite metal fuels used in these applications have been observed to microexplode during combustion. This causes particles to fragment, revealing fresh surfaces, which may enhance burn rates and efficiencies. Despite these potential benefits, few have attempted to control the bubbling and the microexplosion of metal powders as they combust in molten states. Here, we choose Al:Zr composite powders as a representative system to study bubbling and microexplosions and to identify active mechanisms. Using synchrotron x-rays and phase contrast imaging, we observe molten metal particles of various sizes as they burn in air at temperatures ranging from 2700 to 3500 K. We characterize bubble nucleation and growth in the interior of the particles during the combustion process, and we identify heterogeneous nucleation, slow growth and coalescence of bubbles, as well as rapid bubble growth leading to microexplosions. Bubble growth rates and Laplace pressures are calculated, and we find that during slow expansion growth rates are similar to classical predictions of bubble growth in superheated liquids. For rapid expansions we find that a critical growth rate of ∼0.5 m s−1, independent of the initial particle size, is necessary to enable microexplosions. We calculate the rate of gas generation that is needed to enable this growth and we conclude that nitrogen is the gas most likely driving rapid bubble growth and fragmentation. These results provide the first in situ observations of the mechanisms that control bubbling and microexplosions during the combustion of metal particles. © 2018 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85055745487"

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that AIH replaces the Al2O3 passivation layer on Al particles that limits Al oxidation. The new core-shell particle reactivity was characterized using laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) and results for two different Al-AIH core-shell samples that vary in the AIH concentration demonstrate their potential use for explosive enhancement on both fast (detonation velocity) and slow (blast effects) timescales.

Second, a numerical simulation platform of this method was established based on the Monte Carlo JMCT code. By calibrating the absorption efficiencies of the explosive device to γ rays, the element number ratios of a concealed explosive model under the irradiation of thermal neutrons were reconstructed from the neutron capture prompt γ-ray spectrum. The reconstruction values were in good agreement with the actual values, which shows that this method has a high reconstruction precision of the element number ratio for concealed explosives.

An easy-to-use and low-cost gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based colorimetric sensor was developed for the determination of nitroaromatic explosives, i.e., trinitrotoluene (TNT) and tetryl, capable of analyte detection at picomolar (pM) levels. The sensor nanoparticles were synthesized by functionalizing the negatively charged thioglycolic acid (TGA)-modified AuNPs with positively charged (±)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) at a carefully calculated pH. The working principle of the sensor is charge-transfer (CT) interaction between the electron-rich free amino (-NH2) group of DACH and the electron-deficient -NO2 groups of TNT/tetryl, added to possible nanoparticle agglomerization via electrostatic interaction of TNT-Meisenheimer anions with more than one cationic DACH-modified AuNP. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sensor were 1.76 pM and 5.87 pM for TNT and 1.74 pM and 5.80 pM for tetryl, respectively. TNT, tetryl, and tetrytol, extracted from a nitroaromatic explosive-contaminated soil sample, were determined with the proposed sensor, yielding good recoveries. The sensor could be selectively applied to various mixtures of TNT with common energetic materials such as RDX, HMX, and PETN.

Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) colloidal NPs were prepared by femtosecond laser (∼50 fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz) ablation of Ag/Au-target immersed in distilled water. Subsequently, the aggregated nanoparticles were achieved by mixing the pure Ag and Au NPs with different concentrations of NaCl. These aggregated NPs were characterized by UV-visible absorption and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. The SERS substrates were prepared by soaking the filter paper in aggregated NPs. The morphologies of the paper substrates were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy technique.

Each channel contains a specific set of reagents that yields a color change upon interaction with a specific metal salt. The device is capable of performing six simultaneous tests, including the detection of metallic salts present in primer residues and pyrotechnic low explosive devices. Metals detected include lead, barium, antimony, iron, aluminum, zinc, and magnesium. Detection times were found to be less than 10 min and visual limits of detection ranged from 0.025 to 0.4 µg of these metallic compounds. The resultant paper chip was then tested against various interferences and used to examine a number of different pyrotechnic compositions.

The structure of GO dots was characterized by absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, as well as high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses. The typical particle size of the GO dots was 42 nm. The fluorescent characteristics of the GO dots were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Once excited at 360 nm, the GO dots were fluorescent in the range of 450-550 nm, which was dependent on the excitation wavelength. Further, GO dots were effectively utilized for multifarious applications such as photoinduced electron transfer and detection of explosives and biomolecules. The emission property of GO dots was competently quenched by viologens, picric acid (PA), and bilirubin (BR). The mechanism of quenching by viologens and explosives/biomolecules was found to be due to photoinduced electron transfer and the internal filter effect, respectively. Intriguingly, the detection minimum of PA is in the nanomolar level. Toward commercialization, the economic test strips have also been introduced for the identification of PA.

The fate and effects of traditional explosive residues are well understood, while less is known about the impact of Insensitive High Explosives (IHEs) that are currently being brought into military service. Current research has focussed on the investigation of individual constituents of IHE formulations, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios when explosive residues will be deposited together. Therefore, this study investigated the fate and transport of the combined IHE constituents 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), 1-nitroguanidine (NQ) and 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) in two UK soil types. Static experiments ran for 9 weeks to determine the fate of the combined explosive constituents in soil by monitoring the rate of degradation. Transport was examined by running soil column experiments for 5 weeks, with a watering regime equivalent to the average yearly UK rainfall. Both static and soil column experiments confirmed that DNAN and NTO started to degrade within twenty-four hours in soil with high organic content, and were both completely degraded within sixty days. NQ was more stable, with 80% of the original material recovered after sixty days. The major degradation product of DNAN in the test soils was 2-amino-4-nitroanisole (2-ANAN), with trace amounts of 4-amino-2-nitroanisole. NTO was rapidly degraded in soil with high organic content, although no degradation products were identified. Results supported work from literature on the individual constituents DNAN, NQ and NTO suggesting that the three explosives in combination did not interact with each other when in soil. This study should provide a useful insight into the behaviour of three combined Insensitive High Explosive constituents for the predication of soil and water contamination during military training. © 2018","2-s2.0-85040101342"

We show that a successful and reliable identification can be made using the single long-duration THz signal, which contains not only the main reflected pulse, but also several sub-pulses. The method does not use averaging of the measured THz signals over the viewing angles and scanning over the surface area, which significantly increases the signal processing speed. The identification is based on the method of spectral dynamics analysis together with the integral correlation criteria (ICC). We compare the absorption spectral dynamics of a substance under analysis with the corresponding dynamics for a standard substance from database. For reliable and effective substance detection, we propose to use several ICC simultaneously in different time intervals, which contain not only the main pulse of the reflected THz signal, but also the sub-pulses. This way, one can detect and identify the substance in the sample with high probability. As examples of identification, we used the THz signals reflected from the plastic explosive PWM C4 with both rough and concave surface. We show that the main pulse, reflected from the inhomogeneous surface of the sample, contains information about its absorption frequencies. © 2018 Trofimov, Varentsova.

In the last few years, explosive detection systems for cabin baggage screening (EDSCB) have become available. Although used by a number of airports, most countries have not yet implemented these systems on a wide scale. We investigated the benefits of EDSCB with two different levels of automation currently being discussed by regulators and airport operators: automation as a diagnostic aid with an on-screen alarm resolution by the airport security officer (screener) or EDSCB with an automated decision by the machine. The two experiments reported here tested and compared both scenarios and a condition without automation as baseline. Participants were screeners at two international airports who differed in both years of work experience and familiarity with automation aids. Results showed that experienced screeners were good at detecting improvised explosive devices even without EDSCB. EDSCB increased only their detection of bare explosives. In contrast, screeners with less experience (tenure < 1 year) benefitted substantially from EDSCB in detecting both improvised explosive devices and bare explosives. A comparison of all three conditions showed that automated decision provided better human–machine detection performance than on-screen alarm resolution and no automation. This came at the cost of slightly higher false alarm rates on the human–machine system level, which would still be acceptable from an operational point of view. Results indicate that a wide-scale implementation of EDSCB would increase the detection of explosives in passenger bags and automated decision instead of automation as diagnostic aid with on screen alarm resolution should be considered. © 2018 The Authors","2-s2.0-85047220215"

However, the efficacy of simulations is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the equations of state (EOS) and reactive burn models used to characterize the energetic materials. So we're left with a conundrum: we can save the time and money of an extensive testing program, but we must start with a test program sufficient to establish confidence in our modeling parameters. And there is still an urgent need to develop new energetic materials, as the need for more ""tailored"" energetics is an ongoing concern. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using the components of an explosive fill as discrete elements in a simulation, based solely on the relative amounts of the constituents. This is accomplished by assembling a mosaic, or ""checkerboard"", in which each block is made up of the same relative amounts of the constituents as the overall mixture. It is assumed that each constituent has a well-defined set of simulation parameters. We are not considering the actual underlying microstructure, and so we recognize there will be significant limitations to the usefulness of this technique, but we are interested in determining whether there are applications for which this technique might prove useful, in the absence of experimental data on the full energetic material. As an initial test of the concept, three binary explosives were considered: Comp-B, Pentolite and LX-04.

The sensitivity could be improved through addition of ~ 1% ethane (C2H6), which fuels catalytic conversion of NO to NO2. The limit of detection of TD-PERCA-CRDS with respect to TATP is 22 pptv (1 s data), approximately six orders of magnitude below TATP’s saturation vapor pressure. Insights into the mechanism of TATP thermal decomposition, TD-PERCA-CRDS interferences, and the suitability of TD-PERCA-CRDS as a peroxy radical explosive detection method at security check points are discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85046425394"

Bis(1,2,4-oxadiazole)bis(methylene) dinitrate has a calculated detonation pressure 50% higher than that of TNT. The dinitrate compound exhibits a relatively high decomposition temperature that is rarely observed for nitrate-based compounds. The dinitrate was found to have lower sensitivities to impact and friction compared with RDX.

Although the post-detonation mass and composition of metallic species are known, energetics residues from the detonation process are difficult to estimate. Past methods using detonation chamber testing and modeling have been shown to be problematic, especially with newer generation energetic materials. This paper describes a method of field-testing munitions using command detonation systems for static rounds that simulate live-fire high order detonations. Research demonstrates that results from command detonated high explosive rounds are similar to residues from rounds fired onto an ice-covered impact area. The ability to substitute command detonations for live fire will enable the assessment of the environmental impact new munitions will have on training ranges prior to full development and certification.

In this study, a new negative ion source is introduced for ion mobility spectrometry that is based on thermal ionization and operates in the air, applicable to explosives detection. Our system consists of a heating filament powered by an isolated power supply connected to negative high voltage.

The mechanism of nitric oxide (NO/NO+) sensing is based on N-nitrosation of aromatic secondary amine, which was not interfered by reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. The aggregation-induced enhancement of emission (AIEE) behaviors of the PyDA-NP could be attributed to the restriction of intramolecular rotation and vibration, resulting in rigidity enhancement of the molecules. The AIEE behavior of the probe was well established from fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, optical fluorescence microscopy, and time-resolved photoluminescence studies. In a H2O/CH3CN binary mixture (8:2 v/v), the probe showed maximum aggregation with extensive (833-fold) increases in fluorescence intensity and high quantum yield (0.79).

High reactive AgNPs as well as great surface area of MOFs provided a synergetic and high improved catalytic activity for the composite which was studied as a peroxidase mimic in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based oxidations.

UV–vis spectroscopy has been used to analyze the degree of molecular aggregation and stability of the porphyrins in the films. The comparison between the three macrocycles has shown that even though the porphyrin Triad can reduce the molecular aggregation and gain stability in films prepared by spin coating in comparison with TPP films, TPPOH forms the least aggregated and most stable films over the porphyrins used in this work. Absorbance response of porphyrins films towards explosive vapors has been analyzed through their exposure to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) as testing vapor, featuring relatively small and slow spectral changes. Moreover, these absorbance responses have made evident the detrimental effect of molecular aggregation over the sensing capabilities of the porphyrins. However, exposure of porphyrins films to DNT, 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) has resulted in a fast, intense, reversible and repetitive quenching of the fluorescence in all cases, with the monomeric TPPOH exhibiting the best sensing performance among the three compounds. Surprisingly, TPP has shown a relatively large and fast fluorescence response that indicates that aggregation may not affect much the sensing capabilities of porphyrins in terms of fluorescence responses, in contrast to the absorbance responses. This fact has been explained by the lack of emission of H and J-aggregates in the porphyrin films. Finally, although the Triad has featured the slowest quenching response compared to the other two porphyrins, its quenching percentage is in some extent dependent on the type of nitroaromatic, which could be interpreted as a possible ability of Triad to respond more selectively towards explosive vapors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85039969549"

Also, subsequent decomposition of AN during high-temperature transients may lead to the undesired formation of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas. Quantification of AN formation and decomposition has been not adequately addressed so far due to experimental difficulties. We propose an original method for measuring the amount of AN formed on SCR catalysts, and validate it in bench-flow runs over a commercial Cu-CHA formulation. In order to quantify the AN on the catalyst, we rely on its reaction with NO according to NO + NH4NO3 → NO2 + N2 + 2H2O, further investigated via DRIFTs in this work. Based on this stoichiometry, the amount of deposited AN can be estimated from the integral molecular balances of reliably and precisely measurable species, such as NO and NO2. This approach is initially applied over catalyst powder in a rig where N-balances could be evaluated directly, and subsequently validated over more realistic coated monolith catalyst samples in a bench-flow reactor in which N2 was used as carrier gas. In the validation tests, known amounts of AN were initially deposited on the catalyst by controlled pre-dosing of an AN aqueous solution: such amounts were found in satisfactory agreement with the estimates obtained by our method.

Based on DSD (Detonation Shock Dynamics) theory and a linear assumption for the streamline deflection angle, this paper proposes a theoretical model for curved detonation wave propagation in cylinder-type micro-channel charges within a strong confinement of metal tube. Further, dynamic control equations related to the detonation velocity and charge diameter are deduced, a numerical calculation method of detonation velocity and shock front shape is given, and propagation rules for detonation waves with different diameters are obtained. An experiment was designed to test the detonation velocities for micro-channel charges with a booster explosive. The results closely agree with calculations, validating the propagation model of curved detonation waves. It was found that the detonation velocity loss and shock front curvature in the central axis decreased with increasing diameter in the calculation range. Moreover, the smaller the diameter, the greater the rate of change. It is also shown that the model is suitable for the prediction of diameter effects in micro-channel charges, which is of significance for structural design and performance optimization in MEMS initiation systems. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To determine whether the mentioned system can be put into practical use, TG-DSC-MS-FTIR was applied to characterize thermal behaviours of GAP, GAPE and 50/50 GAP/GAPE mixture, and VST was used to decide the compatibility of GAP and GAPE. It turns out that GAPE is compatible with GAP. Decomposition of the mixture can be divided into two steps, rapid decomposition with obvious heat release and self-catalysis decomposition, showing the same tendency with the decomposition of GAP and GAPE. Based on the heating rate of 2, 5, 10 and 15 °C min−1, the kinetics triplets of the three samples’ decomposition were calculated, and the decomposition mechanism was obtained. Results show that the decomposition process was governed by the decomposition of GAPE, which started with the scission of –N3. The critical temperatures of thermal explosion of GAP, GAPE and the mixture were also calculated. Substituting the critical temperature to the reaction rate equation to verify the decomposition process, the dominating role of GAPE in this decomposition of mixture was affirmed. Therefore, GAP/GAPE mixture has a promising future in high-energy propellants/explosives. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85046906329"

It allows pointwise noncontact measurements of dynamic effects. In recent years, it has been applied as a sensor in photoacoustic/photothermal spectroscopy to detect hazardous chemicals or explosive substances in an open environment. In photoacoustic spectroscopy, normally the analysis has to be conducted in a sealed space to enable signal detection, either through a high-sensitivity microphone, or a piezo-sensor coupled with a lock-in amplifier. In addition, the requirement for sample preparation prior to analysis is an impediment preventing practical adoption of the technique in real-time, standoff chemical detection deployments in an open environment. The research team has previously demonstrated the feasible use of a laser interferometric technique to detect photo-vibrational signals of trace chemicals because it was excited by an intensity-modulated quantum cascade laser (QCL). In this study, our long distance laser Doppler vibrometer developed in house was demonstrated to be able to detect the vibration amplitude and frequency of trace explosives at long standoff distances of 100 m in an open environment. Three explosives of 10 µg/mm2 concentration were tested, and the photo-vibrational spectrum obtained by scanning the output wavelength of the QCL through the mid-IR range, coincides well with the corresponding spectrum obtained using typical FTIR equipment.

Once the severity, probability of detection, occurrence, were synthesized, a model was built to determine the risk of a catastrophic event during firing which then accounts for defect growth occurring as a result of rough-handling.

The arc section is sufficiently wide that the flow along the centerline of the arc section remains two-dimensional. Data includes time-of-arrival diagnostics of the detonation along the centerline inner and outer arc surfaces, which is used to obtain the angular speed of the steadily rotating detonation. We also obtain the lead shock shape of the detonation as it sweeps around the arc.

We show that the sonic flow locus of the detonation driving zone largely lies at the end of, or within, the fast reaction stage of the PBX 9502 detonation, with the largest section of the detonation driving zone lying close to the inner arc surface.

Addressing these challenges, we demonstrate a versatile surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform capable of multiphasic, reliable detection with ultrahigh sensitivity. The SERS platform is extremely sensitive and relies on vapor molecules present at the solid-vapor or liquid-vapor interface for reliable detection in ambient conditions (298 K, 1 atm). We observe that metal nanoparticles, subjected to a temperature gradient, migrate and self-assemble into precise nanoparticle assemblies, in a nanoscale analogue of Soret effect. The formation and monodispersity of these nanoparticles assemblies, termed Soret colloids (SCs), is kinetically controllable using the thermal gradient. Soret colloids exhibit excellent size uniformity (monodispersity index, MDI ∼ 0.8) and strong interplasmon coupling to generate uniform and intense electromagnetic hot-spots enabling multiphasic, reliable (relative standard deviation, RSD < 5%), instantaneous (<60 s), ambient (298 K, 1 atm) and spectroscopic detection through SERS.

The principal characteristics examined were the average particle size of RDX, amount of HMX impurity within the RDX particles, method of RDX manufacture, and compositional density. Statistical analysis demonstrated the relevancy of the microstructure influence on the detonation velocity of the developed experimental compositions of 73 wt. % solids and 27 wt. % polyurethane binder.

The change in temperature and humidity will result in PBXs cracks formation and cause higher risk of explosion evolution when undergoing various stimulus including impact or friction. Herein, a self-healing polymer binder is developed to solve this problem. The fluoropolymer gel binder, a PVDF-co-HFP (copolymer of CH2-CF2 and CF2-CF(CF3))/EMIOTf (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate)/graphene ternary composite, has high density, high thermal conductivity, excellent interfacial adhesion property, and exhibits self-healing ability at room temperature. Highly filled PBXs composites with 95% of explosive 2, 6-diamino-3, 5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) and 5% of ternary composite are fabricated. The as-prepared PBX samples have high denotation parameter (7800 m s−1), low impact sensitivities (11–12 J), and low friction sensitivity (no sparks was observed even at friction energy load of 0.36 N). More importantly, our PBXs have effective crack healing ability within 48 h at room temperature. Therefore, the stability and safety of PBXs are improved through the self-healing polymer binder.

The formation of the co-crystal was tested by scanning electron microscope (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Based on the elemental analysis and the enthalpy of combustion obtained by the calorimetric bomb, the enthalpy of formation was calculated to be 196.9 kJ·mol–1.

The detonation velocity (D) and the detonation pres-sure (P) of the co-crystal are 8254.5 m·s–1 and 26.7 GPa, respectively. The thermal behavior and decomposition kinetics of the co-crystal and the coformer were described using nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) techniques. There is an obvious difference between the thermal behavior of the co-crystal and the coformer. The activation energy of the co-crystal (125.3 kJ·mol–1) is lower than the coformer.

One of the advantages of βCDs is the ability to tune their properties by chemical modification.

The cross-linking of βCD with non-toxic triethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (TEGDGE, X=T) and poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ethers (PEGDGE, X=P) yielded soft, water soluble oligomeric compounds (βCXCDs) which can improve the processability of energetic formulations and contribute to their desensitisation. When the PEGDGE cross-linker was used, lower glass transition temperatures were achieved, which extended the operative range of the βCPCD binder to −20 °C. The analogous nitrated systems (βNCXCDs) were therefore synthesised using a 1 : 1 (v/v) ratio of 98 % sulfuric acid/100 % nitric acid or 100 % fuming nitric acid, increasing their solubility in acetone and tetrahydrofuran. The nitrated derivatives were characterised by decomposition temperatures (200 °C) and energies (up to 1750 J g−1) comparable to nitrocellulose. Moreover, the glass transition of the inert βCXCDs at low temperatures (<0 °C) was conserved in the corresponding nitrated βNCXCDs, ensuring the desensitisation of energetic compositions even at low temperatures.

In this study, nanocomposites of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step green process. Under irradiation, 2D MoS2 in the nanocomposites absorbed photons and generated carriers in a wide spectrum. Then MoS2 coupled to gold nanoparticles and produced the enhanced electromagnetic field in the nanosturctures, leading to outstanding optical properties. In virtue of bio-compatibilities of the particles, the nanocomposites were chemically modified with specific peptides to construct an optical biosensor for explosive detection. When exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), the biosensor showed significant absorption peak changes in visible spectra with a concentration-dependent behavior. The biosensor could detect TNT at the concentration as low as 2 × 10−7 M. For selectivity, the biosensor could differentiate TNT from other nitroaromatic explosives that have extremely similar structures to TNT, such as 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT). All the results suggested that the biosensor based on the nanocomposites of 2D MoS2 coupling to plasmonic nanoparticles exhibited remarkable optical performance, which provided a promising approach to design versatile biosensors to detect biochemical molecules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85041662488"

The higher concentrations of H2SO4 resulted in higher concentrations and swift production of TATP. Each combination was compounded with different thermal hazard characteristics. The thermal decomposition of TATP was studied through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to obtain exothermic onset temperature (T0), heat of decomposition (ΔHd), and maximum temperature during the overall reaction (Tmax).

Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism and characteristics of thermal decomposition of CL-20.

The mechanism of thermal decomposition of CL-20 was analyzed from the aspects of potential energy evolution, the primary reactions, and the intermediate and final product species. The effect of temperature on thermal decomposition of CL-20 is also discussed. The initial reaction path of thermal decomposition of CL-20 is N-NO2 cleavage to form NO2, followed by C-N cleavage, leading to the destruction of the cage structure. A small number of clusters appear in the early reactions and disappear at the end of the reactions. The initial reaction path of CL-20 decomposition is the same at different temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the decomposition rate of CL-20 increases and the cage structure is destroyed earlier.

Researchers are limited by the accuracy of previous K0 value reference measurements on which to base their calibrations.

In recent years, high quality data from experiments using embedded gauges and other diagnostic techniques have inspired the development of a range of new high-fidelity computer models for explosives. The experiments and models have led to new insights, both at the continuum scale applicable to most shock and detonation experiments, and at the mesoscale relevant to hotspots and burning within explosive microstructures. This article reviews the continuum and mesoscale models, and their application to explosive phenomena, gaining insights to aid future model development and improved understanding of the physics of shock initiation and detonation propagation. In particular, it is argued that ""desensitization"" and the effect of porosity on high explosives can both be explained by the combined effect of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, rather than the traditional hotspot-based explanations linked to pressure-dependent reaction rates. © British Crown Owned Copyright 2018/AWE.","2-s2.0-85044734841"

The luminescence emission of nanosized spinel oxide ZnCr2O4 with high chemical and thermal stabilities has been used as a potential probe to detect such organic explosives. Low temperature solution combustion synthesized ZnCr2O4 oxide with an average particle size of ∼9 nm exhibits strong luminescence emission at 410 nm upon excitation at 260 nm in an aqueous suspension. The presence of nitroaromatics in ZnCr2O4 suspension dramatically suppresses the luminescence emission providing an opportunity to detect it quantitatively. The detection limit for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) is as low as 23 ppb. A number of organic compounds have been investigated for a comprehensive understanding. The astonishing sensitivity of ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles towards nitro explosives is appealing for sensing application.

Quantum chemical calculations provided detailed insight into the thermolysis mechanism of DAT missing in the existing literature. Moreover, several contradictory assumptions on the mechanism and key intermediates of thermolysis were resolved. The unimolecular primary decomposition reactions of the seven isomers of DAT were studied in the gas phase and in the melt using a simplified model of the latter. The two-step reaction of N2 elimination from the diamino tautomer was found to be the primary decomposition process of DAT in the gas phase and melt. The effective Arrhenius parameters of this process were calculated to be Ea = 43.4 kcal mol-1 and log(A/s-1) = 15.2 in a good agreement with the experimental values.

On gelation, both π–π* transitions and the emission peak of the gelator show redshifts with a 4.5-fold increase of fluorescence intensity in the gel state indicating J-aggregation. The nitrogen lone-pair electrons of OGR make it a donor, and electron transfer occurs to acceptor nitroaromatics causing fluorescence quenching, which is further promoted due to its acidity.

Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis was used to show that photo-induced electron transfer (PET) is the underlying mechanism behind the luminescence quenching of the probe upon exposure to TNT, the rationality of which was further confirmed by the recording of a high charge transfer rate. We also found the existence of an energy level crossing between the local excited (LE) state and charge transfer (CT) state of a complex of the probe and TNT, which was confirmed using energy profile calculations along the linearly interpolated internal coordinate (LIIC) pathway. © 2018 the Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-85050945138"

In this paper, we report hydrogen peroxide vapor sensor transducers operated at room temperature using platinum (Pt) nanoparticles-decorated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network films. The SWCNT films are coated on a SiO2/Si substrate using a low-cost, effective, and scalable spray printing process. Then, the Pt nanoparticles are decorated on SWCNT surfaces by an effective photo-reduction process, which is performed by immersing the SWCNT films into the H2PtCl6 solution mixed with methanol and deionized water under UV irradiation with a wavelength of 254 nm. The active organic radicals produced from methanol under UV irradiation rapidly reduce PtCl62− ions to Pt0 on SWCNT surfaces within 5 min. The nanoparticle size is modulated from 2 to 10 nm by controlling the molar concentrations of the H2PtCl6 solutions in a range from 2 to 50 mM. By forming interdigitated electrodes on the Pt nanoparticles-decorated SWCNT films, sensor transducers are fabricated for detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) vapor. The sensors show a linear response to H2O2 vapor in a range from ca. 2 to 60 ppm and weak responses to NH3 and SO2 gases and negligible responses to NO2, CO, and C6H6 gases, which are representative biomarkers of exhaled breath. We expect that in the future, our sensing films will be able to be utilized in highly sensitive, real-time hydrogen peroxide vapor sensors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85030854268"

These energetic substances were first characterized by elemental analysis, IR, mass, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic methods. The energetic substances were studied by thermogravimetry, and it was understood that the mechanism of the thermal decomposition reactions consists of two successive exothermic thermal reactions. In the first thermal reaction, the energetic material was converted to furoxane compounds, and then, these furoxane compounds were decomposed by the second thermal reaction. Activation energies and Arrhenius pre-exponential factors of thermal responses were determined by using isothermal (Coats–Redfern) and nonisothermal/isoconvertional (Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall) methods with thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. With these calculated values, other thermodynamic parameters reaction enthalpy, entropy changes and free energy were calculated. Formation enthalpies of the elements of the energetic substances were theoretically calculated using the CBS-4M algorithm in the Gaussian 09 program for the synthesized energetic substances. In the thermal decomposition reactions, the products were estimated with the aid of literature data and the enthalpies of explosion reactions were theoretically calculated according to the Hess Law. Besides, the exothermic energies in the first and second thermal reactions of the energetic substances were measured by DSC. The results measured by DSC were compared with the calculated theoretical results and were found to be very close to each other. In the study, antimicrobial activity was estimated to be high because energetic molecules are strained molecules, and it is possible this tension can affect the medium. According to this thought, antimicrobial activity was determined by using five different bacteria and a fungus. Antimicrobial activity values were determined by “agar dilution” method, and results were found as minimum inhibition concentration. Among the three energetic substances, 2,6-dinitro-4-cyano-azidobenzene was found to have the most active compound. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85030119555"

Inhomogeneities have been registered by electro-optical camera NANOGATE 4BP allowing to make 4 frames with the exposure time 10 ns. According to experimental results the detonation front in nitromethane-acetone mixture is unstable. It is evident that pulsations on detonation front do not form spatial periodic structure and their dimensions differ several times. But mean longitudinal size of pulsation is about 500 μm at 20 wt% of acetone concentration. This means that the typical size of cell equals to reaction zone width. The same structure of cellular front have been registered in 70/30 FEFO-methanol mixture. Second kind of instability, failure waves, was observed in neat nitromethane at the free surface. In this case the stability loss result in turbulent flow which is clearly detected in the shots obtained. Adding small amount of DETA (0.5 wt%) results in disappearance of the failure waves and flow stabilization. The effect is caused by the fact that DETA sharply accelerates initial rate of chemical reaction because it is sensitizer for nitromethane. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-85043709947"

The details of the interaction between an HE detonation and its confinement are essential to achieving the objectives of the explosive device. For the high pressures induced by detonation loading, both the solid HE and confiner materials will flow. The structure and speed of a propagating detonation, and ultimately the pressures generated in the reaction zone to drive the confiner, depend on the induced flow both within the confiner and along the HE-confiner material interface. The detonation-confiner interactions are heavily influenced by the material properties and, in some cases, the thickness of the confiner.

Computations that reveal the fluid mechanics of HE detonation-confiner interactions for finite reaction-zone length detonations are discussed and compared with the polar analysis.

The root-mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis clearly shows that the proposed model is more reliable to predict P than the Kamlet-Jacobs method especially for fluorine and chlorine-containing compositions. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Detection is typically accomplished in less one second. The detection method is solar blind and can be employed at standoff distances up to 5 m or more without interference from natural or man-made light sources. By this method, unknown suspicious powders, that potentially contain biological hazards, are automatically triaged using a four-step sequential iteration of Principal Component Analysis methods using pre-determined eigenvector sets to: 1) detect and differentiate whether a sample is bio or non-bio; 2) whether the detected bio is microbial, protein, or plant; 3) if microbial, whether the sample is a bacterial cell or spore, yeast, fungi, or fungal spore; and 4) to provide some higher level of cellular differentiability. The same method is also applicable to a wide range of chemical agents and explosives materials. The method and related instruments employ sample excitation at 248.6 nm and detection over a spectral range from 250 nm to below 350 nm, a spectral region blind to solar and most man-made light sources. Detection and classification is accomplished in less a few seconds. Sample detection and classification rates can be over 20 per second. Fully integrated and self-contained hand-held instruments are presently under development with an overall weight less than about 8 lbs, including a battery for over 8 hours of typical use.

In order to cover novel materials not yet included in databases, a library free approach was chosen. The evaluation of explosion hazards for solid and liquid samples in the lowest milligram range was carried out by relying on the response of the substances towards thermal activation rather than on their chemical nature. The reaction was monitored by a combination of metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors, photodiodes and a pressure sensor. Utilization of ambient air as a carrier gas and indirect control over sample weight by the geometry of the heater allow uncomplicated handling under real working conditions. In the first phase readily available physical and chemical sensors were applied. The rate of correct assignments was 99.8% with no false negatives and only 1 false positive out of 475 experiments. The possibility of library free operation was also confirmed by an additional series of experiments on materials not used for training the system.

The technique employs a ground-penetrating radar that transmits electromagnetic waves in order to strike the objects and then receives the backscattering electromagnetic wave to perform signal processing. This signal processing is divided into four main steps as follows. First, preprocessing is used to reduce the clutter due to the effect of the media layer interface. Second, the late time of the scattering signal is estimated using a simple cross correlation. Third, a few successive poles are extracted from the scattering response at the estimated late time by using the short-time matrix pencil method. Finally, the extracted poles are fed for object classification with different constitutions and/or shapes using a support vector machine. Simulations according to the practical situation in three southern provinces of Thailand to counter the improvised explosive devices were set up. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated. The simulation results showed that the proposed technique can efficiently detect and classify buried objects for counter-improvised explosive device operations in the military. ©2018.

So, the purpose of this paper is to provide details of sensors based on selective nanocoatings by combining trinitrotoluene (TNT) receptors (Trp-His-Trp) bound to conjugated polydiacetylene polymers on a graphene channel in GFET for detecting explosives TNT. Design/methodology/approach - Following an introduction, this paper describes the way of manufacturing of the GFET sensor by using investigation methods for transferring graphene sheet from Cu foil to target substrates, which is functionalized by the TNT peptide receptors, to offer a system which has the capability of answering the presence of related target molecules (TNT). Finally, brief conclusions are drawn. Findings - In a word, shortly after graphene discovery, it has been explored with a variety of methods gradually. Because of its exceptional electrical properties (e.g. extremely high carrier mobility and capacity), electrochemical properties such as high electron transfer rate and structural properties, graphene has already showed great potential and success in chemical and biological sensing fields. Therefore, the authors used a biological receptor with a field effect transistor (FET) based on graphene to fabricate sensor for achieving high sensitivity and selectivity that can detect explosive substances such as TNT. The transport property changed compared to that of the FET made by intrinsic graphene, that is, the Dirac point position moved from positive Vg to negative Vg, indicating the transition of graphene from p-type to n-type after annealing in TNT, and the results show the bipolar property change of GFET with the TNT concentration and the possibility to develop a robust, easy-to-use and low-cost TNT detection method for performing a sensitive, reliable and semi-quantitative detection in a wide detection range. Originality/value - In this timeframe of history, TNT is a common explosive used in both military and industrial settings. Its convenient handling properties and explosive strength make it a common choice in military operations and bioterrorism. TNT and other conventional explosives are the mainstays of terrorist bombs and the anti-personnel mines that kill or injure more than 15,000 people annually in war-torn countries. In large, openair environments, such as airports, train stations and minefields, concentrations of these explosives can be vanishingly small - a few parts of TNT, for instance, per trillion parts of air. That can make it impossible for conventional bomb and mine detectors to detect the explosives and save lives. So, in this paper, the authors report a potential solution with design and manufacture of a GFET sensor based on a biological receptor for real-time detection of TNT explosives specifically. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85043270219"

In order to provide additional information for the AIT assessment, we are developing a technique that enables the identification of threat composition based on dielectric constant. The dielectric constant is extracted from the spectral content of the broadband holographic imaging data. The technique is demonstrated from images collected in a prototype personnel-screening system. The dielectric constant is obtained by numerically fitting the reflection coeficient as a function of frequency to an optical model. The reflection coefficient is a function of frequency because of propagation effects, such as multiple reflections and energy loss, that are associated with the material's complex dielectric constant. In order to accomplish the analysis using an imaging system, the spectrum is obtained from an integration of the reflectivity image spectrum, which is an intermediate result in the image reconstruction algorithm. The present use of an imaging array demonstrates the ability to detect dielectric constant in small areas on a complex target.

Conventional detection methods can hardly detect RDX, and no direct vapor detection has been reported based on a fluorescence method because RDX has no aromatic rings and hence it does not have a strong enough interaction with the fluorescent probe. By the introduction of Boc-NH- into the side chain terminal of polyfluorene, a conjugated polymer probe, PF6-Boc, has been designed and synthesized. The probe showed 91% fluorescence quenching in saturated RDX vapor and retained a 66% quenching response even after 8 cycles. A respectable ultrasensitive detection limit of 0.041 ppt was obtained. From simulated landmine detection experiments (RDX buried under sand), the probe showed a significant black quenching spot on the fluorescent filter paper within 5 min and the quenching spots became darker over time, even though the explosives were isolated in the soil and the air flow had a negative effect.

Herein, we explore the detection of buried explosive hazards (BEHs) in handheld ground penetrating radar (HH-GPR) via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In particular, we investigate the potential for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to impute new data based on limited and class imbalance labeled data.

We presented a sensitive chemiresistor gas sensor based on modified nanostructured dye-doped polypyrrole (PPy) as anfilm to detection of TNT for the first time. The chemiresistor gas sensors were fabricated via electrosynthesis of PPy on Au interdigital electrodes (Au-IDEs) in the presence of the sulfonated dyes. The films were modified with n-butylamine (nBA), and they could absorb TNT molecules by the formation of the Meisenheimer complex. The role of the sulfonated dyes on the behavior of films was studied. The properties of the polymeric films before and after modification were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, elemental mapping analysis and spectroelectrochemical methods The mechanism of sensing was studied by spectroelectrochemical method and response of modified gas sensor was compared to unmodified sensor. The spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that the potential-dependent of spectra in PPy-Dye films is more than in PPy-ClO4 film after modification. Thus dye molecule can act as versatile compound in the polymer backbone. It was found that modified chemiresistor gas sensor has a high sensitivity and good selectivity to TNT over other related gases and no response without modification.

The Vapor Wake® (VW) dog was developed to create a dog phenotype ideally suited for detecting hand-carried and body-worn explosives. VW dogs (VWDs) are trained to sample and alert to target odors in the aerodynamic wakes of moving persons, which entrains vapor and small particles from the person. The behavioral characteristics necessary for dogs to be successfully trained and employed for the application of VW are a distinct subset of the desired general characteristics of dogs used for detection tasks due to the dynamic nature of moving targets. The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral characteristics of candidate detector dogs to determine the particular qualities that set apart VW-capable dogs from others. We assessed 146 candidate detector dogs from a VW breeding and training program. Dogs received identical puppy development and foundational odor training and underwent performance evaluations at 3, 6, 10, and 12 months old, after which they were sold for service. Dogs were categorized based on their final outcome of the training program, independently determined by private vendors, corresponding to three groups: dogs successfully sold for VW, dogs sold for standard explosives detection, and dogs that failed to be placed in any type of detector dog service (Washouts). Comparisons of behavioral evaluations between the groups were made across domains pertaining to search-related behaviors (Performance), reactions to novel stimuli (Environmental), and overall ease of learning new tasks (Trainability). Comparisons were also made at each evaluation to determine any early emergence of differences. VWDs scored significantly higher on Performance characteristics compared to standard explosives detection dogs (EDDs) and Washouts. However, Environmental characteristics did not differentiate VWDs from EDDs, though scores on these measures were significantly lower in the Washouts. Furthermore, differences between groups emerged as early as 3 and 6 months for select measures. We describe the behavioral characteristics targeted for selection in developing the VW phenotype and discuss the relative merit and degree of expression of those characteristics in the success of dogs bred and trained for the VW application. © 2018 Lazarowski, Haney, Brock, Fischer, Rogers, Angle, Katz and Waggoner.","2-s2.0-85044947852"

Detection systems have to be tested and validated with realistic samples and amounts as early as possible during the development. However, at present, well defined and homogeneous test materials which are a crucial requirement for development and validation of trace detection systems are not available. Existing preparation methods of reference samples, such as drop-And-dry (drop casting) methods, present a range of variability and reproducibility issues, including inhomogeneous sample coverage and material waste. Especially for the preparation of samples for optical stand-off technologies the drop-on-demand and inkjet printing technology could be a promising method of producing standardized chemically contaminated test materials with high accuracy, precision, scalability, and flexibility to allow for the inexpensive, high-Throughput production. Test samples with contaminations ranging from nanogrammes to microgrammes have been prepared and analysed over several weeks of storage. The influence of plot parameters on the morphology and durability of printed samples of various common explosives have been investigated on different substrates. HPLC measurements were made to quantitatively evaluate the durability of printed samples. The morphology of the test samples was additionally characterized by optical microscopy and confocal Raman-microscopy. Besides the occurrence of polymorphic phase changes, described in literature for low concentrated drop-on-demand samples of RDX, we observed changes in sample distribution by recrystallization of some explosives in the printed samples.

Unlike approaches that focus only on elucidating mesoscopic mechanisms important to ignition, the present analysis seeks a methodology directly applicable to continuum explosive burn models. Because the Scaled Uniform Reactive Front (SURF) burn model has a microstructural basis, it is chosen as the starting point of the present analysis. To build upon the SURF framework, a literal translation is performed of the high-level conceptual notions for which SURF is based, to concrete ignition–combustion parameters, a statistical description of the microstructure, and other thermo-chemical data acquired by non-shock experiments. The analysis requires a void volume fraction distribution acquired from ultra-small angle neutron scattering (USANS). The shock response of PBX 9502 is used to illustrate the theory. While the analysis requires calibration to a shock experiment (the pop plot, for example), the results are a self-consistent set of realistic physical quantities that contribute to the shock initiation process including, initial temperature, chemical kinetics, a statistical description of the microstructure, and the hot spot size, spacing, and temperature. The utility of having a mesoscale based theory is that once the critical hot spot temperature, as a function of shock pressure, is known for a given explosive and initial porosity distribution, the entire set of meso- and macro-scale results, including the pop plot can be calculated for any other porosity. Thus, one can understand changes in sensitivity at different densities (void size distributions), relying only on the assumption that the hot spot temperature curve would not differ significantly if the morphology of the hots spots were similar. Another important utility of the present analysis is to address the question of the role of initial temperature on the observed shock sensitivity of PBX 9502 and other explosives. © 2017 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85037654107"

Two HE models are considered, broadly representing the properties of either a high- or low-detonation-speed HE, which permits studies of detonation propagating at speeds faster or slower than the confiner sound speed. The HE detonation is responsible for driving the compaction front in the confiner, while, in turn, the high material density generated in the confiner as a result of the compaction process can provide a strong confinement effect on the HE detonation structure. Polar solutions that describe the local flow interaction of the oblique HE detonation shock and equilibrium state behind an oblique compaction wave with rapid compaction relaxation rates are studied for varying initial solid volume fractions of the porous confiner. Multi-material numerical simulations are conducted to study the effect of detonation wave driven compaction in the porous confiner on both the detonation propagation speed and detonation driving zone structure. We perform a parametric study to establish how detonation confinement is influenced both by the initial solid volume fraction of the porous confiner and by the time scale of the dynamic compaction relaxation process relative to the detonation reaction time scale, for both the high- and low-detonation-speed HE models. The compaction relaxation time scale is found to have a significant influence on the confinement dynamics, with slower compaction relaxation time scales resulting in more strongly confined detonations and increased detonation speeds.

The particle sizes of nano-HNS and nano-TATB were 98.4 and 57.8 nm, respectively. An SEM analysis was employed to image the micron morphology of nano-explosives. The particle size distribution was calculated by measuring the size of 300 particles in SEM images. XRD, IR, and XPS analyses were used to confirm whether the crystal phase, molecule structure, and surface elements were changed by the milling process. Thermal decomposition of nano-HNS and nano-TATB was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal-infrared spectrometry online (DSC-IR) analyses. Using DSC traces collected from different heating rates, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of thermolysis of raw and nano-explosives were calculated (activation energy (EK), pre-exponential factor (lnAK), rate constant (k), activation heat (ΔH≠), activation free energy (ΔG≠), activation entropy (ΔS≠), critical temperature of thermal explosion (Tb), and critical heating rate of thermal explosion (dT/dt)Tb). The results indicated that nano-explosives were of different kinetic and thermodynamic properties from starting explosives. In addition, the gas products for thermal decomposition of nano-HNS and nano-TATB were detected. Although HNS and TATB are both nitro explosives, the decomposition products of the two were different.

When these materials combust, these metals can be released into the air, causing adverse health effects such as pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, particulate-matter-induced allergies, and cancer. Hence, robust, field-deployable methods are needed to detect and quantify these suspended metallic particles in air, identify their sources, and develop mitigation strategies. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a technique for elemental detection, commonly used on solids and liquids. In this study, we explored nanosecond-duration LIBS for detecting airborne metals during reactions of solid propellant strands, resulting from additives of aluminum (Al), copper, lead, lead stearate, and mercury chloride. Using the second harmonic of a 10-ns-duration 10-Hz, Nd:YAG laser, plasma was generated in the gas-phase exhaust plume of burning propellant strands containing the target metals. Under the current experimental conditions, the ns-LIBS scheme was capable of detecting Al at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 16% by weight in the propellant strand. As the weight percentage increased, the LIBS signal was detected by more laser shots, up to a point where the system transition from being nonhomogeneous to a more-uniform distribution of particles.

Here we investigate the fate of explosives present in soils following an actual detonation process and compare this to the fate of explosives spiked into ‘pristine’ undetonated soils. We also assess the effects of the detonations on the physical properties of the soils. Our scanning electron microscopy analyses reveal that detonations result in newly-fractured planes within the soil aggregates, and novel micro Computed Tomography analyses of the soils reveal, for the first time, the effect of the detonations on the internal architecture of the soils. We demonstrate that detonations cause an increase in soil porosity, and this correlates to an increased rate of TNT transformation and loss within the detonated soils, compared to spiked pristine soils. We propose that this increased TNT transformation is due to an increased bioavailability of the TNT within the now more porous post-detonation soils, making the TNT more easily accessible by soil-borne bacteria for potential biodegradation. This new discovery potentially exposes novel remediation methods for explosive contaminated soils where actual detonation of the soil significantly promotes subsequent TNT degradation. This work also suggests previously unexplored ramifications associated with high energy soil disruption. © 2017 Yu et al.

The variation in electrical resistance was used as the mechanism by which the sensor responded to the concentration of explosive vapor. Polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The results showed that the fabricated PPy nanoparticles have a near spherical morphology with an average size of around 56 nm. The surface of the sensor template was then coated with a layer of nanocomposite composed of the synthesized PPy nanoparticles and carbowax polymer. Calibration and performance testing of the fabricated sensors were carried out with a special setup designed for explosive vapor generation under static conditions. The developed sensor was able to sense different concentrations of the explosive (0.5-100 ppm). The coated sensor showed a linear response in the concentration range of 0.5-50 ppm. The results showed that the designed sensor had a favorable sensitivity to the explosive.

The SPR sensor was first validated under laboratory conditions with uncontaminated natural water samples spiked with known concentrations of RDX near the EPA limit of 2 ppb, which was then applied to monitor environmental samples collected in different downgradient wells near a grenade training range. The SPR sensor was finally tested on the field, where environmental samples were analysed on location in less than 90 minutes per well, which included the time to setup the equipment, sample the well and analyse the sample. The SPR analysis time was less than 45 minutes for equilibration, recalibration and measuring the water sample. Results obtained with the SPR sensors were cross-validated with the standard HPLC method (EPA method 8330b), and they showed good agreement with an accuracy within less than 1.6 ppb for analysis at the sampling sites, and with the relative standard deviation (RSD) better than 20% for field and laboratory measurements. The SPR sensor worked in a range of environmental conditions, including operation from about 0 °C to nearly 30 °C.

In this work, we have synthesized a series of porous luminescent covalent organic polymers (COPs) through copolymerization of the 2,7-Dibromopyrene (DBP) and 1,3,6,8-Tetrabromopyrene (TBP) in different ratios by using Ni-catalyzed Yamamoto reaction. All the solid COPs show high luminescent intensity, owing to the extended π conjugated systems in the synthesized COPs. By exploring the luminescent quenching property of COPs for nitro explosives, we find that all the COPs exhibit high selectivity for detecting PA, especially for COP-612. Further study indicates that even in the presence of other nitroaromatic explosives, COP-612 still exhibits high selectivity for detecting PA, i.e., the competitive nitro explosives show no influence on the sensing property of COP-612 for PA, which suggests that COP-612 is an excellent candidate for selectively detecting PA in practical applications. In addition, the luminescent emission wavelength of COP-616 reaches 838 nm, which provides potential applications in the areas of bioimaging, organic light-emitting diodes and chemosensors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85006401234"

Selective detection of TNT from other nitroaromatics is still challenging as it possess similar chemical structure and properties with its analogues. In the present work, the water soluble polyethylene imine protected copper nanoclusters (PEI CuNC) were developed as fluorescent and colorimetric probe which can detect TNT selectively and sensitively both in aqueous and vapour form. The PEI CuNC with size less than 3 nm was prepared via a simple one pot microwave method and exhibited bright blue emission at 480 nm. The fluorescence of PEI CuNC can be remarkably quenched by TNT through the formation of amine-TNT Meisenheimer complex. Quenching was further facilitated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and inner filter effect (IFE). A good linearity was observed for the PEI CuNC based fluorescence detection of TNT with limit of detection 14 pM. Meanwhile the formation of Meisenheimer complex resulted in a significant colour change of the solution from pale green to red, which enables visual detection of TNT with detection limit down to 0.05 nM. The fluorescence as well as colorimetric method displayed excellent selectivity and sensitivity over other interfering compounds and ions.

Because the extremely high pressure oscillation occurs in less than a millisecond, an in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to observe the detailed flow structures and determine the adequate burning characteristics, including the burning rate. A hybrid RANS/LES scheme with a 5th order upwind weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) is implemented to capture complex, strong shock waves in highly turbulent combustion. A two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme tracks the combusting ZPP granules reasonably well. Monodisperse and Rosin-Rammler assumptions are applied to the ZPP granule distribution. The monodisperse assumption reveals that the diameter of the ZPP (17 μm) achieves marginal agreement with the measurements. However, the Rosin-Rammler distribution improves the transient and dynamic combustion characteristics in that the small granules contribute to a faster burning rate and stronger shock waves.

The e-nose detects less than 1 molecule of TNT out of 10+12 N2 molecules in a carrier gas in 1 s. Differently silanized sensors give different responses to different molecules. Electronic responses are presented for TNT, RDX, DNT, H2S, HCN, FeS, NH3, propane, methanol, acetone, ethanol, methane, toluene and water. We consider the number density of these molecules and find that silane surfaces show extreme affinity for attracting molecules of TNT, DNT and RDX. The probability to bind these molecules and form a surface-adsorbate is typically 10+7 times larger than the probability to bind water molecules, for example.

However, OB/OD effects a variety of hazardous damages to environment. Therefore, using incinerators to treat expired explosives is required instead of OB/OD. To guarantee the safety of these demilitarization methods, the blast wave of the explosives should be previously recognized to evaluate the impact of detonations. Although various materials are used to produce explosives, most researches have focused on trinitrotoluene (TNT). Other representative explosives such as research department explosives (RDX) and high melting explosives (HMX) are seldom studied in the literature. Therefore, our aim was to understand the blast wave of three materials under different geometry throughout simulations. To improve accuracy and reduce computational time, a zoning technique with Euler-Lagrange coupling method was used. Due to limitations and difficulties of detonation experiments, simulations were verified by theoretical models.

Interestingly, owing to its high porosity and large surface area, this Zr-MOF showed quick luminescent response time (in 1 min) for TNP and Fe3+. The results obtained may provide useful information for the design of MOFs with the large permanent porosity in sensing applications for large molecules in the future. © 2017 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The consequences from a terrorist attack lead to critical economic infrastructure, public safety, and environment. Traditional intelligence gathering methods followed by government agencies and physical security systems at vulnerable facilities are not efficient for long-term implications. In this work, we propose a novel self-control solution using knowledge based decision making system (KBDMS) to detect explosives prior to attacks. The proposed system detects explosive materials using sensors, collects invader images (if any) by surveillance cameras, and forwards the information to a base station system (BSS) and/or a monitoring station to alert the emergency services. Adaptive media access control (A-MAC) protocol is used for the communication between the sensors. RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) algorithm that has digital signatory and integrity of log messages is used to enhance security. The collected information is analyzed at the monitoring station using face recognition techniques, situation reaction techniques, crime and intelligence analysis techniques, and threat severity estimation. The proposed system is evaluated using an Arduino simulator. Experimental results have shown the promise of this approach to defeat tragic attacks by detecting the explosives in prior. © 2017 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85019654203"

Restrictions on the carriage of LAGs remain today, and the operational impact of introducing further screening of liquids is subject to ongoing debate. This paper addresses one of the concerns, namely that the false alarm rates of liquid explosive detection systems (LEDS) are adversely affected by the filling level of LAGs containers. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the operational impact of screening partially full containers, based on a large number of screening repetitions under laboratory conditions and robust statistical analysis. False alarm rates were observed for 39 LAGs screened with 5 different LEDS. For each combination, four different container filling levels (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) were studied. These observations were used to model the impact of partially filling for sequential combinations of equipment. Three possible scenarios were considered, namely passengers being allowed to carry (1) only water, (2) water & soft drinks, and (3) all LAGs. The results show that, for a sequential combination of two equipment types, the impact of partially filled containers on the overall false alarm rate is negligible. Nevertheless, partially filled containers do result in an approximate two-fold increase in the number of items requiring level-two screening, which may be significant for airports when managing their screening processes. © 2017, The Auhtor(s).","2-s2.0-85032495299"

Given to the use of more powerful components such as flash powder recently, some firecrackers may cause massive life-threatening injuries in case of such misuse. Innocuous black powder firecrackers are subject to national explosives legislation and only have the potential to cause harmless injuries restricted to the soft tissue. We here report two cases of suicide committed by an intraoral placement of firecrackers, resulting in similar patterns of skull injury. As it was first unknown whether black powder firecrackers can potentially cause serious skull injury, we compared the potential of destruction using black powder and flash powder firecrackers in a standardized skull simulant model (Synbone, Malans, Switzerland). This was the first experiment to date simulating the impacts resulting from an intraoral burst in a skull simulant model. The intraoral burst of a “D-Böller” (an example of one of the most powerful black powder firecrackers in Germany) did not lead to any injuries of the osseous skull. In contrast, the “La Bomba” (an example of the weakest known flash powder firecrackers) caused complex fractures of both the viscero- and neurocranium. The results obtained from this experimental study indicate that black powder firecrackers are less likely to cause severe injuries as a consequence of intraoral explosions, whereas flash powder-based crackers may lead to massive life-threatening craniofacial destructions and potentially death. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-85018733975"

The photoluminescence quenching response depends on the energetics of electron transfer from the photo-excited sensing material to the analytes, the vapor pressure of the analyte, and the diffusion process of the analytes in the sensing films. It is critical that the performance of a potential sensing material be evaluated in the solid-state with a range of analytes and across a range of vapor concentrations to ensure high sensitivities through non-contact sampling are achievable. We have investigated the photoluminescence quenching of three generations of carbazole-based dendrimers across a range of nitro-containing analyte vapor concentrations, including the TNT by-product 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and the tagging agent 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB). We show that the performance of all three dendrimer generations in the solid-state is near identical.

As the first step, morphological and electrical properties of gold, palladium and silver non-continuous layers deposited on silver phthalocyanine (AgPc) have been studied. Experiments monitored by SEM confirmed formation of metal clusters on organic surface if subthreshold amount of metal is deposited onto the AgPc layer (i.e. layer of equivalent thickness of 4 nm for Pd, 5 nm for Au and 8 nm for Ag) and thermal stabilization follows. We demonstrated that metallic non-continuous layers on AgPc can be used for effective adjustment of chemiresistor's electrical resistance. Resistance of all modified sensors in reference atmosphere (synthetic air) − R0 − was effectively shifted by one to four orders of magnitude to lower values, so that cheaper devices and set-ups can be used for resistance measurements. Moreover, measurements of responses of Me/AgPc chemiresistors to 1 ppm of NO2 revealed that the presence of metal reduces the sensor response time (τ90). On basis of optimal R0 and τ90 values, Pd(1 nm)/AgPc chemiresistor was selected to be the most prospective for detection of taggants. Finally, the taggants were detected on Pd (1 nm)/AgPc chemiresistor in two modes: without- or with- photoactivation. While the dc-response (Sdc) to 190 ppm of non-activated 2-nitrotoluene vapors was negligible, on photoactivation we reached the value of Sdc = 5.8. This significant improvement, which is attributed to the formation of nitrogen dioxide during photoactivation of 2-nitrotoluene, and also negligible interaction of sensor with water vapor as the most common interferent make our method applicable for early detection of tagged explosives in real “field” conditions.

Existing methods are based primarily on the effects of blast overpressure on surrounding structures. Window breakage and structural damage are well studied and are widely used to derive most probable explosion strengths. Other explosive effects such as debris throw are usually left out of such forensic analyses. In this paper, a quantitative method is presented that can be used to obtain the explosion strength based on debris throw. When the method is applied together with analysis of other evidence at a post blast scene, more accurate predictions of the original amount of explosive can be obtained. An overview of the required information that has to be collected from a post-blast scene is outlined, which will aid in the backward calculations that will be carried out in the next stage. This calculation method is applied to two case studies, which illustrate that it is applicable to events involving both low and high order accidental explosion events. Besides accidents, the method is also applicable to intentional explosion scenarios such as terrorist attacks. It is shown that the added value of such a method to forensic investigation depends on the precision of the data collected. Therefore, it is recommended that first responders not only register the impact locations but also attempt to identify the part of the donor installation from which the debris originated. Furthermore, estimates should be made of the launch height and ballistic properties of the debris and information should be recorded on obstructions and terrain properties in the vicinity.

Energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) as a new type of energetic materials have attracted wide attention. However, regulating the energetic characters of ECPs and establishing the relationship between structure and energetic property remains great challenges. In this study, two isomorphic 2D π-stacked solvent-free coordination polymers, [M(N3)2(atrz)]n (M = Co 1, Cd 2; atrz = 4,4′-azo-1,2,4-triazole), were hydrothermally prepared and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. The two compounds exhibit reliable stabilities, remarkable positive enthalpies of formation, and prominent heats of detonation. The enthalpy of formation of 1 is 4.21 kJ·g-1, which is higher than those of all hitherto known primary explosives. Repulsive steric clashes between the sensitive azide ions in 1 and 2 influence the mechanical sensitivities deduced from the calculated noncovalent interaction domains.

This approach signals a departure from current use of databases and pulling of information technologies as well as allowing separation of concerns between how data are organised/structured and how data are manipulated/processed. Such an approach utilises an adaptive knowledge management platform capable of supporting organisational operations of LEAs using data aggregated from assorted, heterogeneous and online sources. Such knowledge is then pushed to the users, using recommenders, in an effortless manner addressing the needs of the organisation. Moreover, the system is designed to afford easier change of operational needs through the addition and removal of multiple folksonomies (representing changes in focus or new trends). These changes are further enriched with semantics providing specialised domain-specific content recommendations and semantically enriched search capabilities. This approach to knowledge retrieval has been applied to the domain of homemade explosives and counter-terrorism efforts as part of the HOMER project, where data are aggregated from sources such as police databases, online forums and explosives wikis. Data are stored in an unstructured manner and annotated by the users, ultimately being categorised as per the knowledge retrieval needs of the organisation, which in this case is to carry out efficient and effective investigations regarding homemade explosives.

As there is no reliable nano-colorimetric method for PETN assay, we developed an indirect method based on the determination of nitrite, obtained by reduction of nitrate derived from the alkaline hydrolysis of PETN with H2O2. We colorimetrically determined the final product, nitrite, by both conventional Griess reaction and a recently developed gold nanoparticle-4-aminothiophenol-N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine (AuNP−4-ATP+NED) method. Nitramines (RDX and HMX), if present, could be degraded by alkaline hydrolysis, without affecting PETN. The analytical performance characteristics of the developed assays as molar absorptivity (ε), limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were: ɛ=1.06×105 L mol−1 cm−1, LOD=0.03 mg L−1 and LOQ=0.11 mg L−1 for indirect Griess method; ɛ=1.9×104 L mol−1 cm−1; LOD=0.12 mg L−1 and LOQ=0.4 mg L−1 for AuNP−4-ATP+NED method. Both methods were applied to a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of PETN and TNT (corresponding to the composition of military explosive ‘Pentolite’). In order to eliminate the interference from TNT, the Meisenheimer anion of TNT formed in alkaline medium was retained on a strongly basic anion exchange resin column. As PETN had a very low solubility in water, common soil ions could be eliminated by prewashing the sample with water, or in acetone-water mixtures, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- could be tolerated at equal (1:1) mass ratios. Soil nitrates and nitrites, at a mass ratio of 50:1, could be separated from PETN with the aid of their insolubilities in acetone and of their retention affinity toward a strongly basic anion-exchange resin.

The synergistic effect of the high surface-to-volume ratio of QDs, the good permeability of nanofibrous membranes and the differential response introduced by surface ligands was played by constructing the sensing array using nanofibrous membranes loaded with ZnS QDs featuring several surface ligands. Interestingly, although the fluorescence quenching of the nanofibrous membranes is not linearly related to the exposure time, the fingerprint of each explosive at different times is very similar in shape, and the fingerprints of the three explosives show different shapes. Three saturated vapors of nitroaromatic explosives could be reliably detected and discriminated by the array at room temperature.

This experimental study simulated an IED supply chain from the sourcing of raw materials through to device emplacement. Mineralogy, quartz grain surface texture analysis (QGSTA) and particle size analysis (PSA) were used to assess whether environmental materials were transferred and subsequently persisted on the different components of three pressure plate IEDs. The research also addressed whether these samples were comprised of material from single or multiple geographical provenances that represented supply chain activity nodes. The simulation demonstrated that material derived from multiple activity nodes, was transferred and persisted on device components. The results from the mineralogy and QGSTA illustrated the value these techniques offer for the analysis of mixed provenance samples. The results from the PSA, which produces a bulk signature of the sample, failed to distinguish multiple provenances. The study also considered how the environmental material recovered could be used to generate information regarding the geographical locations the device had been in contact with, in an intelligence style investigation, and demonstrated that geoforensic analysis has the potential to be of value to international counter-IED efforts.

To reliably ignite nEMs with lower-power laser irradiation, light-sensitive materials could be added to the nEMs matrix. In this study, we investigated the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the combustion and explosion characteristics of laser irradiation-ignited nEMs. The threshold power and delay time of ignition gradually decreased with increases in the MWCNT contents of Al nanoparticle (NP)/CuO NP-based nEMs. The threshold power and delay time of MWCNT (10 wt%)/Al NP/CuO NP ignition were reduced to ∼40% and ∼50%, respectively, of those of MWCNT (0 wt%)/Al NP/CuO NP. This suggests that the MWCNTs act as effective optical igniters by absorbing irradiated laser beams and subsequently generating heat by the photo-thermal effect, promoting nEMs ignition. The optimal addition of ≤2 wt% MWCNTs in the nEMs matrix enhanced the pressurization rate, flame propagation speed, and pressure wave speed of nEMs because the MWCNTs rapidly transferred heat energy from nEMs combustion. However, adding excess MWCNTs suppressed the combustion and explosion characteristics of the Al NP/CuO NP-based nEMs matrix by heat dissipation and thermochemical interventions.

Cocrystallization has been explored as another route to development of novel materials. However, very little characterization of detonation performance has been performed for these energetic cocrystals. A major challenge for performing detonation velocity measurements with cocrystals is that typical measurement techniques require hundreds of grams to kilograms of material, an amount that exceeds the entire supply of many cocrystals. In this work, small-scale detonation velocity measurements using about 1.2 g of material per test employing microwave interferometry are presented and discussed for a novel cocrystal of 1-methyl-3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole (MDNT) and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and compared to a physical mixture of MDNT and CL-20 in the same molar ratio. The results are compared with detonation velocity measurements with cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), which provide validation of the technique and further comparison of the results. With this technique, detonation velocity differences as low as 100 m/s are resolvable. The MDNT/CL-20 cocrystal is observed to detonate over 500 m/s faster than the physical mix and over 600 m/s faster than HMX at the same charge density which is held constant in this work. The enthalpy of formation of the MDNT/CL-20 cocrystal was also measured. Using this, the detonation velocity of the cocrystal was calculated using thermochemistry to be 230 m/s faster than that of the physical mixture of MDNT and CL-20 in the same molar ratio as is contained within the cocrystal at a charge density of 1.4 g/cm3. The higher detonation velocity of the cocrystal (both measured and predicted) compared to the physical mixture is likely attributable to bonding energy contained within the cocrystal and the arrangement of the coformers within the cocrystal. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The multilayered Ti2NTx (T is the surface termination) obtained was sonicated in DMSO and centrifuged to obtain few-layered Ti2NTx. MXene formation was verified, and the material was completely characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, FESEM-EDS, TEM, STM, and AFM techniques. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of the synthesized Ti2NTx was investigated by fabricating paper, silicon, and glass-based SERS substrates. A Raman enhancement factor of 1012 was demonstrated using rhodamine 6G as the model compound with 532 nm excitation wavelength. Detection of trace level explosives with a simple paper-based SERS substrate with Ti2N (MXene) as active material was also illustrated. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85029937777"

While explosion events like intentionally triggered bombs cause obvious harm to life and property, other explosions intended for benign purposes in quarries and construction zones may also cause unintended harm as a result of emanating seismic vibrations. As of today, detecting explosions, ranging them, and estimating their intensities are all accomplished only by seismometers that sense the associated ground vibrations and pressure changes as a result of their triggering. Unfortunately, seismometers are bulky, expensive and unsuitable for the ubiquitous use. In this paper, our broad motivation is to demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging the pervasive sensing and processing capabilities of modern smartphones to analyze explosion events. Within this context, we specifically address the problem of ranging and estimating the intensity of an explosion by leveraging the accelerometer and pressure sensors in the smartphone. To do so, we emplaced a number of smartphones in the vicinity of real explosion blasts conducted at a university mining laboratory, where the material blasted was Dynamite with Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO). We then collected the corresponding accelerometer and pressure readings sensed by the phone. We extracted a number of novel features, and designed a machine learning based algorithmic framework for ranging and estimating the intensity of the explosion event. After an extensive validation, we find that the average-case error in ranging (i.e., estimating the distance to the source of the explosion event) and estimating the intensity of explosive material (in terms of its charge weight) are 8.24% and 7.37%, respectively. We also present perspectives on encoding our algorithm as a smartphone app, identify several critical challenges that will be encountered in real-time data processing of smartphone accelerometers and pressure sensors in the context of pervasive sensing of explosions, and also identify other practical issues like the diversity of smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, our work is pioneering in demonstrating the feasibility of using smartphones to analyze explosion events.

Measurements of the output of explosives are commonly based upon the detonation parameters of the chemical energy content of the explosive. These quantities provide a correct understanding of the energy stored in an explosive, but they do not provide a direct measure of the different modes in which the energy is released. This optically based technique combines high-speed and ultra-high-speed imaging to characterize the casing fragmentation and the detonator-driven shock load. The procedure presented here could be used as an alternative to current indirect methods—such as the Trauzl lead block test—because of its simplicity, high data accuracy, and minimum demand for test repetition. This technique was applied to experimentally measure air shock expansion versus time and calculating the blast wave energy from the detonation of the high explosive charge inside the detonator. Direct measurements of the shock front geometry provide insight into the physics of the initiation buildup. Because of their geometry, standard detonators show an initial ellipsoidal shock expansion that degenerates into a final spherical wave. This non-uniform shape creates variable blast parameters along the primary blast wave. Additionally, optical measurements are validated using piezoelectric pressure transducers. The energy fraction spent in the acceleration of the metal shell is experimentally measured and correlated with the Gurney model, as well as to several empirical formulations for blasts from fragmenting munitions. The fragment area distribution is also studied using digital particle imaging analysis and correlated with the Mott distribution. Understanding the fragmentation distribution plays a critical role when performing hazard evaluation from these types of devices. In general, this technique allows for characterization of the detonator within 6–8% error with no knowledge of the amount or type of explosive contained within the shell, making it also suitable for the study of unknown improvised explosive devices. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-85014554400"

Two analogous poly(para-phenyleneethynylene)s (PPE) are also prepared as comparison to demonstrate the difference between the truxene and the phenyl moieties in their optical properties and their sensing performance. The four polymers are tested for nitroaromatic analytes and display different fluorescence quenching responses. The quenching efficiencies are dependent upon the spectral overlap between the absorbance of the analyte and the emission of the fluorescent polymer. Optical fingerprints are obtained, based on the unique response patterns of the analytes toward the polymers. With this small sensor array, one can distinguish nine nitroaromatic analytes with 100% accuracy. The amphiphilic polymer F127 (a polyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol block copolymer) carries the hydrophobic HCPs and self-assembles into micelles in water, forming highly fluorescent HCP micelles.

This study used 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) to illustrate a detection method based on the transmissive photonic band edge shift (TPBES) due to the binding of TNT with amine anchored on particle surfaces to form Meisenheimer (amine-TNT) complexes. PhCs are exceptionally sensitive to a small change in refractive index caused by surface modification. As a result, they are suitable for sensing specific reactions between an amine and TNT. This method achieved a wide detection range of TNT concentrations from 10-12 to 10-4 M. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (DNT) and toluene were used as a control and blank, respectively. Because of gravitational sedimentation, the TNT-functionalized particles were self-assembled in pure ethanol. They were measured by UV-visible transmission spectroscopy.

A readily accessible brand of exploding targets called Tannerite® has been identified as a potential material for abuse as an explosive in pipe bombs. The ability to recover and genotype DNA from such weapons may be vital in the effort to identify suspects associated with these devices. While it is possible to recover DNA from post-blast fragments using short tandem repeat markers (STRs), genotyping success can be negatively affected by low quantities of DNA, degradation, and/or PCR inhibitors. Alternative markers such as insertion/null (INNULs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are bi-allelic genetic markers that are shorter genomic targets than STRs for amplification, which are more likely to resist degradation. In this study, we constructed pipe bombs that were spiked with known amounts of biological material to: 1) recover “touch” DNA from the surface of the device, and 2) recover traces of blood from the ends of wires (simulated finger prick). The bombs were detonated with the binary explosive Tannerite® using double-base smokeless powder to initiate the reaction. DNA extracted from the post-blast fragments was quantified with the Quantifiler® Trio DNA Quantification Kit. STR analysis was conducted using the GlobalFiler® Amplification Kit, INNULs were amplified using an early-access version of the InnoTyper™ 21 Kit, and SNP analysis via massively parallel sequencing (MPS) was performed using the HID-Ion Ampliseq™ Identity and Ancestry panels using the Ion Chef and Ion PGM sequencing system. The results of this study showed that INNUL markers resulted in the most complete genetic profiles when compared to STR and SNP profiles. The random match probabilities calculated for samples using INNULs were lower than with STRs when less than 14 STR alleles were reported. These results suggest that INNUL analysis may be well suited for low-template and/or degraded DNA samples, and may be used to supplement incomplete or failed STR analysis. Human identification using SNP analysis via MPS showed variable success with low-level post-blast samples in this study (<150 pg).

When fillers detonated, detonation velocities of ~4.4 mm/μs were measured. In such cases, side walls of the pipe were thrown first; the average fragment velocity was ~1000 km/s. In deflagrations, the end cap was first thrown; fragment velocities were only ~240 km/s.

An amino-aptamer with inherent affinity for TNT was mixed with TNT prior to covalent attachement onto a glassy carbon electrode surface which was modified with a nanocomposite of the type gold nanoparticle@fullerene (AuNP@C60). Electropolymerization of dopamine around the aptamer/TNT complex entraps the complex and retains the aptamer. After removal of TNT, it is assumed that the MIP cavity acts synergistically with the embedded aptamer to form a nanohybrid receptor (aptamer-molecular imprinting polymer). This results in recognition properties superior to that of aptamer alone. Benefiting from the double specific molecular recognition property of molecular imprinting polymers and aptamers along with the in situ generation of AuNP onto the surface of the modified GCE leads to superb sensing properties. Properties such as lower limit of detection (3.5 attomolar) and wider linear concentration range of TNT (0.01 femtomolar to 1.5 μmol L−1) are distinctly better than other reported methods.

There are few universally accepted methods to achieve this end. This project aims to explore this issue through the examination of the spatial distribution of the tissue fragments resulting from an explosive event. To address this, a two stage pilot study was conducted: first, a series of controlled explosions on porcine carcases was undertaken. Second, the data produced from these explosions were used to chart the spatial distribution of the tissue debris. In the controlled explosions, 3 kg military grade explosive was chosen to create the maximum amount of fragmentation; this level of explosive also prevented the complete disappearance of forensic evidence through evaporation. Additionally, the blast created by military grade explosive is highly powerful and would mean that the maximum possible distance was achieved and would therefore allow the recorded distances and pattern spread to be a guideline for forensic recovery of associated with an explosive amount of an unknown size and quality. A total station was employed to record the location of the resulting forensic evidence, with the collected data analysed using R Studio. The observed patterns suggested that the distribution of remains is fairly consistent in trials under similar environmental conditions.

Vapor detection in the form of detector canines overcomes these and other obstacles, and has proven to be a highly effective mode of detection. Due to inherent safety precautions associated with working with HMEs, experienced detector canines often lack the frequency of training on HME material necessary to remain proficient. For this reason, the Mixed Odor Delivery Device (MODD) was designed allowing canines to train on the odor of mixed explosives while keeping the HME components separate and unmixed, thus alleviating the safety requirements for handling, storing, and transporting explosives. Experiments across multiple investigative strategies were carried out to evaluate and characterize the vapor distribution in the MODD including computational modeling, analytical testing, and field trials.

This goal requires canine training to be approached similarly to scientific sensor design. Developing a canine training regimen is made challenging by a lack of understanding of the canine's odor environment, which is dynamic and typically contains multiple odorants. Existing methodology assumes that the handler's intention is an adequate surrogate for actual knowledge of the odors cuing the canine, but canines are easily exposed to unintentional explosive odors through training material cross-contamination. A sensitive, real-time (∼1 s) vapor analysis mass spectrometer was developed to provide tools, techniques, and knowledge to better understand, train, and utilize canines.

Blast wave characteristics, displacement and strain histories were measured, and the post-blast damage and mode of failure of the test specimens were observed. Results showed change in failure mechanism with variation of blast load scaled distance, and/or longitudinal reinforcement. To simulate the observed responses of the test beams and investigate the relationship between the initial forces and deformations developed in RC beams due to blast loading and the associated failure modes, beams were modeled using the Timoshenko beam theory. It was determined that beam deformations in the initial phase of a blast induced response cycle were dominated by shear. The ratio of shear demand to shear capacity, the latter computed based on the Canadian Standard CAN/CSA A23.3, was deemed to be the most influential parameter that governed the failure mechanism.

In general, nanosecond-duration laser pulses on the order of 10-500 mJ, are used to generate a “weak” plasma, typically less than 10% electrons to other species ratio. Light emitted from this plasma is then collected, sent through a spectrometer, and imaged on to a CCD array. Based on the spectral lines detected and their relative intensities, the elemental composition of the material can be determined and quantified. LIBS is a versatile technique because it can be used on materials in all phases: solid, liquid, and gas. LIBS experiments are relatively easy to set up, robust, and can be used in the field with minimal or no sample preparation. Because of these advantages of LIBS compared to other analytical techniques, it has been widely employed in the defense sector, specifically in the detection of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) materials. The objective of this work is to investigate LIBS for characterization of emissions from explosive materials, in particular to detect the release of metal additives of aluminum, copper, mercury and lead into the surrounding air. A 10-Hz Nd:YAG laser is used as the source to generate the plasma. Solid propellant strands cured with predetermined quantities of trace metals are used as a source for the flame, and the plasma is generated using a tightly focused laser pulse. Initial analysis of plasma decay was conducted using solid test pieces of each of the elements or their compounds to be able to better understand the decay times of broadband background emissions compared to the specific spectral features corresponding to the species of interest. A laser energy dependence study was also conducted to determine the optimal energy to generate the plasma in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio. Aluminum has been detected in the plume of reacting propellant strands doped with known concentrations, and a general correlation between concentration of metal and LIBS signal has also been found. © 2017 by Dr. Waruna Kulatilaka","2-s2.0-85017245930"

Luminescence-based detection of explosive vapours with an organic semiconductor has attracted much interest because of its potential for detectors that have high sensitivity, compact form factor, simple operation and low-cost. Despite the abundance of literature on novel sensor materials systems there are relatively few mechanistic studies targeted towards vapour-based sensing. In this Perspective, we will review the progress that has been made in understanding the processes that control the real-time luminescence quenching of thin films by analyte vapours. These are the non-radiative quenching process by which the sensor exciton decays, the analyte-sensor intermolecular binding interaction, and the diffusion process for the analyte vapours in the film. We comment on the contributions of each of these processes towards the sensing response and, in particular, the relative roles of analyte diffusion and exciton diffusion. While the latter has been historically judged to be one of, if not the primary, causes for the high sensitivity of many conjugated polymers to nitrated vapours, recent evidence suggests that long exciton diffusion lengths are unnecessary.

OCNPs, prepared from CNPs by HNO3 oxidation, contain amounts of oxygen functional groups (OFG) including -COOH, -OH, -C=O and so on. HCSs, prepared by the green and facile hydrothermal carbonization of glucose, possess the highest loading of hydroxyl groups (approximately 80% of total surface oxygen-containing groups) among these carbon materials.

The surface Lcys can be used as not only the stabilizer of the rQDs but also the primary amine provider which can react with TNT to form Meisenheimer complexes. Without any additional surface modification procedure, the fluorescence of rQDs equipped with Lcys was selectively quenched by TNT because electrons of the rQDs transferred to TNT molecules due to the formation of Meisenheimer complexes. Meanwhile, the embedded gQDs always remained constant.

This specificity is spoiled by natural and anthropogenic interference that can swamp the NQR signal. Fortunately, the spatial magnetic signature from the explosive differs significantly from that of interference and can be exploited to separate the signals. An array of coils, however, cannot provide truly independent measurements due to the inductive coupling between the coils. Single coil configurations can cancel out constant interference and retain the signal from an NQR coil, but the balance between arms of the coil is compromised by differential coupling to the environment. Atomic magnetometers, an emergent technology predicted to surpass the sensitivity of coil detection, do not suffer from such coupling and have no fundamental limitation to forming an array of independent sensors. We have demonstrated up to 94× interference rejection with a 4-sensor array spanning 25 cm. The array symmetry permits rejection of linearly varying interference.

The poor ultraviolet absorption and lack of an aromatic ring make peroxide-based explosives very hard to detect. As the signature compound of peroxide-based explosives, H2O2 vapor detection became more and more important. Rare-earth-doped vanadate is considered to be a suitable material for the detection of hydrogen peroxide due to the quenching of its fluorescence in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Its only drawback lies on its poor photostability. In this work, we have developed a new synthesis to limit the photobleaching of EuVO4-based films. We propose herein an original protocol using microwave-assisted sol–gel route. The photostability of luminescent EuVO4 has been achieved and the sensitivity has been greatly increased. The detection limit for H2O2 vapor is as low as 100 parts per billion (ppb). The characterization of these nanoparticles by photoelectron spectroscopy clearly correlates their sensitivity to H2O2 to the surface chemistry.

Moreover, the offender often intends to destroy the fingerprint bearing crucial evidence, using these destructive forces. Furthermore, the fingerprints exposed to despoiled crime scenes are generally neglected due to the misconception of impossible recovery. In the present study, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based fluorescent small particle reagents were formulated, compared and evaluated for the development of latent prints exposed to destructive conditions. Fresh latent prints and prints exposed to natural or simulated destructive crime scene conditions, namely, arson, explosion, burial in soil, immersion in drainage water and burial in snow were developed using the three compositions. Latent prints were successfully recovered even from the destructive crime scene simulations. Better quality prints were obtained from fresh prints, arson, soil burial and drainage water.

Samples of the highly energetic materials (HEMs) 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were deposited on aluminum plates and detected at several source-target distances by carrying out remote infrared spectroscopy (RIRS) measurements on the aluminum substrates in active mode. The samples tested were placed at 1-30 m for the RIRS detection experiments. The effect of the angle of incidence/collection of the IR beams on the vibrational band intensities and the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) were investigated. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature. Surface concentrations from 50 to 400 μg/cm2 were studied. Partial least squares regression analysis was applied to the spectra obtained.

However, these are restricted to relatively simple and homogeneous materials. The present paper reports for the first time the semiquantitative estimation of the sensing responses of quartz crystal microbalance sensors based on a complex material, taking relative humidity into account. The sensing material is methylated mesoporous silica, and the analytes are vapors of the nitroaromatic compounds 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and trinitrotoluene (TNT). Our approach is based on molecular dynamics simulations. The amount of vapor (water, 2,4-DNT or TNT) adsorbed on the sensing surfaces is obtained as a function of their partial pressure by simulating adsorption isotherms at high temperature and extrapolating the results to ambient conditions. Furthermore, a correction factor is introduced to account for the role of residual water within the mesoporous silica. The order of magnitude of the simulated sensing responses to 2,4-DNT and TNT is found to be consistent with experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85017606203"

The photoacoustic signal, with frequencies predominantly between 100 and 500 kHz, is detected remotely via a wideband laser Doppler vibrometer. This two-laser system can be used to rapidly detect and discriminate explosives from ordinary background materials, which have significantly weaker photoacoustic response.

The remarkably high catalytic performance of MOF1 over [Ni-H4TCPP] metalloligand has been attributed due to cooperative catalysis involving the Ni-centered porphyrin secendary building units (SBUs) and the Ni3-oxo node. Further, the MOF1 was recycled and reused up to three cycles without any significant loss of catalytic activity as well as structural rigidity.

Under optimum sensing concentrations, the absorbance changes of AuNPs at 519 nm were linear with the concentration of nitroguanidine in the range of 15–55 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.997.

The graphene surface was chemically modified using electron beam generated plasmas produced in oxygen or nitrogen containing backgrounds to introduce oxygen or nitrogen moieties. The use of this chemical modification route enabled enhancement of the electrochemical signal for TNT, with the oxygen treatment showing a more pronounced detection than the nitrogen treatment. For graphene modified with oxygen, the electrochemical response to TNT can be fit to a two-site Langmuir isotherm suggesting different sites on the graphene surface with different affinities for TNT. We estimate a limit of detection for TNT equal to 20 ppb based on the analytical standard S/N ratio of 3. In addition, this approach to sensor fabrication is inherently a high-throughput, high-volume process amenable to industrial applications. High quality epitaxial graphene is easily grown over large area SiC substrates, while plasma processing is a rapid approach to large area substrate processing.

AIT systems deployed in airports auto-detect potential threats by highlighting their location on a generic outline of a person using imaging data collected over a range of frequency. We show how the spectral information from the imaging data can be used to identify the composition of an anomalous object, in particular if it is an explosive material. The discriminative value of the technique was illustrated on military sheet explosive using millimeter-wave reflection data at frequencies 18-40 GHz, and commercial explosives using 2-18 GHz, but the free-space measurement was limited to a single horn with a large-Area sample. This work extends the method to imaging data collected at high resolution with a 18-40 GHz imaging system. The identification of explosives is accomplished by extracting the dielectric constant from the free-space, multifrequency data. The reflection coefficient is a function of frequency because of propagation effects associated with the material's complex dielectric constant, which include interference from multiple reflections and energy loss in the sample. The dielectric constant is obtained by numerically fitting the reflection coefficient as a function of frequency to an optical model.

It is based on the best available methods, which can be used for different types of energetic compounds including nitroaromatics, nitroaliphatics, nitramines, and nitrate esters. The computed relative powers are consistent with the measured data for some new materials containing complex molecular structures. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

OxP-MN (1) acts as a selective and reversible probe for rapid colorimetric detection of picric acid (PA) among other nitroaromatics by switching between two porphyrinoid states. This system displayed a higher β2 value of 1.7 × 108 M-2 and was able to detect PA down to 1.12 ppm (4.99 μM). β-Dicyanovinyl substituted porphyrinogen (OxP-MN) reported here contains a porphyrinogen anion binding site and a dicyanovinyl group as a cyanide-dependent reactive subunit. OxP-MN displayed the first evidence that a β-electron acceptor through a vinyl linker in the case of porphyrinogen results in only an abated shift in the spectrum in contrast to its porphyrin analogues. Porphyrinogen OxP-MN (1) can be switched between a number of porphyrinoid states such as metalloporphodimethene, metalloporphyrin, porphyrinogen, etc. by using CN-, F- and other basic anions. In addition, OxP-MN unveils the unique property of detecting toxic cyanide ions and fluoride ions when ""hidden"" within a mixture of other anions. Also, OxP-MN behaves as a dual sensor for picric acid and basic anions such as F-, CN-, OAc-, and H2PO4-via the indicator displacement assay under the unrestricted queue. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","2-s2.0-85029325510"

HSI can detect threat materials on environmental surfaces, where the concentration of the target of interest is often very low and is typically found within complex scenery. Unfortunately, current generation HSI systems have size, weight, and power limitations that prohibit their use for field-portable and/or real-time applications. Current generation systems commonly provide an inefficient area search rate, require close proximity to the target for screening, and/or are not capable of making real-time measurements. ChemImage Sensor Systems (CISS) is developing a variety of real-time, wide-field hyperspectral imaging systems that utilize shortwave infrared (SWIR) absorption and Raman spectroscopy. SWIR HSI sensors provide wide-area imagery with at or near real time detection speeds. Raman HSI sensors are being developed to overcome two obstacles present in standard Raman detection systems: slow area search rate (due to small laser spot sizes) and lack of eye-safety. SWIR HSI sensors have been integrated into mobile, robot based platforms and handheld variants for the detection of explosives and chemical warfare agents (CWAs). In addition, the fusion of these two technologies into a single system has shown the feasibility of using both techniques concurrently to provide higher probability of detection and lower false alarm rates.

The widespread use of improvised explosives and anti-personnel landmines have caused thousands of civilian casualties across the world. Current scenario of globalized civilization threat from terror drives the need to improve the performance and capabilities of standoff explosive trace detection devices to be able to anticipate the threat from a safe distance to prevent explosions and save human lives. In recent years, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging approach for material or elemental investigations. All the principle elements on the surface are detectable in a single measurement using LIBS and hence, a standoff LIBS based method has been used to remotely detect explosive traces from several to tens of metres distance. The most important component of LIBS based standoff explosive trace detection system is the telescope which enables remote identification of chemical constituents of the explosives. However, in a compact LIBS system where Cassegrain telescope serves the purpose of laser beam delivery and light collection, need a design optimization of the telescope system. This paper reports design optimization of a Cassegrain telescope to detect explosives remotely for LIBS system. A design optimization of Schmidt corrector plate was carried out for Nd:YAG laser. Effect of different design parameters was investigated to eliminate spherical aberration in the system. Effect of different laser wavelengths on the Schmidt corrector design was also investigated for the standoff LIBS system. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Apart from the wide range of organic fluorescent chemosensors, transition metal complexes play a prominent role in the sensing of nitroaromatic explosives owing to their rich photophysical characteristics.

To give a theoretical description of laser propagation in energy-saturated photosensitive composites as in diffuse scattering media with close packed scatterers. Methodology. Analysis and generalization of theoretical research. The Monte Carlo method of direct statistical modeling has been applied. A computational study of the process of scattering of photons in photosensitive energysaturated composites has been carried out, the results of the computational study have been analyzed. Findings. The results of computation of the illuminance for diffuse scattering media (DSM) by the Monte Carlo method have been presented. In particular, it has been determined that the initiation of highly sensitive explosives and photosensitive composites can not be explained based on the concepts of a multiple increase in volumetric illumination within a diffuse scattering medium with respect to the surface one, since such an increase is unfeasible. However, the light regime in a diffuse scattering medium is one of the determining factors for the ignition of explosives by laser radiation. Originality. The diffuse reflection factor of DSM mainly depends on the photon survival rate and the refraction index. For each DSM there is a limiting value of the laser beam radius beginning with which the spatial illuminance does not change with the increase in the laser beam radius r. It is shown that with the increase in the bunch concentration in samples of photosensitive explosives (VS), the depth of the material layer with high values of illuminance increases. Moreover, the growth rate is inversely proportional to the beam radius. This regularity is well correlated with observed experimental dependence of VS sensitivity on the bunch concentration. Thus, in case of initiation of substance of VS2 grade with a 1.5 mm diameter laser beam, the sensitivity increased approximately by a factor of 2 with an increase in the bunch concentration from 10 to 20-30 %, while for a 4.5 mm diameter beam the sensitivity growth was ∼ 13 %. Practical value. The results of theoretical research were used when making laboratory samples of the optical detonator and during the research on actuation of optical detonators depending on the energetic and geometric characteristics of the laser beam. © Sobolev V.

One major task includes the development of new methods and sensor systems for the detection. Many existing remote or standoff methods like infrared or raman spectroscopy find their limits, if the hazardous material is concealed in an object. Imaging technologies using x-ray or terahertz radiation usually yield no information about the chemical content itself. However, the exact knowledge of the real threat potential of a suspicious object is crucial for disarming the device. A new approach deals with a laser drilling and sampling system for the use as verification detector for suspicious objects. Central part of the system is a miniaturised, diode pumped Nd:YAG laser oscillator-amplifier. The system allows drilling into most materials like metals, synthetics or textiles with bore hole diameters in the micron scale. During the drilling process, the hazardous material can be sampled for further investigation with suitable detection methods.

One of the promising areas is laser remote detection of explosives. In this work we have developed a portable laser and quantitatively investigated its use for sampling of common explosives on different surfaces. It has been shown that most of desorbed products consist of molecules of explosives themselves, and the proportion of dissociated fragments is small. It is shown that laser irradiation increases the amount of desorbed matter not only by increasing the number of pulses, but also due to an additional warming of a substrate. The use of frequency mode smoothens peculiar properties of the desorption process for all explosives and substrates used. The typical desorbed amount ranges from 95 ng to 7900 ng for 10-second irradiation of the samples used. The developed laser can be applied in ion mobility spectrometry, IMS-based detectors of explosives to increase the distance of sampling.

Many ordinary materials (paper, for example) are transparent to THz radiation while the hazardous substances, which have to detect, possess fingerprints in this frequency range. However, covers of ordinary material can distort its spectrum in such a way that the spectrum of reflected THz pulse or transmitted THz pulse will contain absorption frequencies, which are inherent to dangerous substance (explosives, illistic drugs.), despite their absence in the material under consideration. On the other hand, it is well-known that the spectrum of medium response under the action of THz pulse is broader than the incident THz pulse spectrum. This is a result of a possibility of high energy level excitation due to cascade mechanism of their excitation. For practical point of view, it is very important to know about features of a covering substance influence on the medium response spectrum broadening. This problem is investigated in our report using the computer simulation. We carry out computer simulation of a few-cycle electromagnetic pulse interaction with a substance exhibiting nonlinear non-instantaneous response. An influence of the pulse duration and polarization relaxation rate on the pulse interaction with an uncovered medium and with a medium, which is covered by a linear disordered structure, is investigated. We demonstrate that the spectra of reflected or transmitted pulses may comprise multiple additional spectral lines, caused by various transitions between energy levels of molecules. The spectral intensity of these energy level transitions is affected by the pulse duration and the effective time of interaction which depends on polarization relaxation rate as well as the medium layer thickness. © 2016 SPIE.","2-s2.0-85006990198"

Namely, with a temperature 18° C, the relative humidity of about 50 % and the distance between the parabolic mirror and the object about of 3.5 meters. We show that the standard THz-TDS method reveals the spectral features of many neutral substances and explosives in the noisy THz signals from the illicit stimulant MA, at the same time this method is not able to detect the presence of this stimulant in the noisy signals. The second example is the detection and identification of plastids with inhomogeneous surface in reflection mode.

In this work, we replaced the 3H source of our previously described high-resolution ion mobility spectrometer with 75 mm drift tube length with a commercially available X-ray source. It is shown that the current configuration maintains the resolving power of R = 100 which was reported for the original setup containing a 3H source. The main advantage of an X-ray source is that the intensity of the radiation can be adjusted by varying its operating parameters, i.e., filament current and acceleration voltage. At the expense of reduced resolving power, the sensitivity of the setup can be increased by increasing the activity of the source. Therefore, the performance of the setup can be adjusted to the specific requirements of any application. To investigate the relation between operating parameters of the X-Ray source and the performance of the ion mobility spectrometer, parametric studies of filament current and acceleration voltage are performed and the influence on resolving power, peak height, and noise is analyzed. © 2016 Author(s).","2-s2.0-84971294678"

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a prompt and sensitive detection method, has been widely applied in chemical and biological samples analysis. The most popular noble metal nanoparticle colloids, prepared by chemical reduction with citrate or hydroxylamine, are generally negatively charged. This study demonstrates that the negatively charged silver nanoparticles were transformed into the positively charged ones by sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), a potent copper chelating agent. The zeta potential of DDTC modified silver colloid is about 32.1 mV, suggesting its positively charged nature. The XPS and SERS spectra indicate the positively charged silver nanoparticles resulted from the bidentate configuration leading to the redistribution of the free electron pair in N atom and formation of the CN+ bonding of DDTC. The positively charged silver nanoparticles can be used in the detection of inorganic explosives anions with a subnanogram detection limit through electrostatic interactions. The common organic explosive picric acid (PA) could also be detected through a similar interaction force. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","2-s2.0-84973115764"

However, large light losses are inherent in the design due to sequential imaging at different wavelengths, leading to effective transmission often well below 1 %. The use of digital micromirror devices (DMD) and compressive sensing (CS) in imaging Raman explosives trace detection can improve light throughput and add significant flexibility compared to existing systems. DMDs are based on mature microelectronics technology, and are compact, scalable, and can be customized for specific tasks, including new functions not available with current technologies. This paper has been focusing on investigating how a DMD can be used when applying CS-based imaging Raman spectroscopy on stand-off explosives trace detection, and evaluating the performance in terms of light throughput, image reconstruction ability and potential detection limits. This type of setup also gives the possibility to combine imaging Raman with non-spatially resolved fluorescence suppression techniques, such as Kerr gating. The system used consists of a 2nd harmonics Nd:YAG laser for sample excitation, collection optics, DMD, CMOScamera and a spectrometer with ICCD camera for signal gating and detection. Initial results for compressive sensing imaging Raman shows a stable reconstruction procedure even at low signals and in presence of interfering background signal. It is also shown to give increased effective light transmission without sacrificing molecular specificity or area coverage compared to filter based imaging Raman. At the same time it adds flexibility so the setup can be customized for new functionality. © 2016 SPIE.","2-s2.0-84982108611"

It combines an ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and a promising method of laser desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS). The DIOS is widely used in mass spectrometry due to the possibility of small molecule detection and high sensitivity. It is known that IMS based on laser ion source is a power method for the fast detection of ultralow concentration of organic molecules. However requirement of using high energy pulse ultraviolet laser increases weight and size of the device. The use of DIOS in an ion source of IMS could decrease energy pulse requirements and allows one to construct both compact and high sensitive device for analyzing gas and liquid probes. On the other hand mechanisms of DIOS in gas media is poorly studied, especially in case of nitroaromatic compounds. The investigation of the desorption/ionization on porous silicon (pSi) surface of nitroaromatic compounds has been carried out for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) using IMS and mass spectrometry (MS).

Current sensor technologies, although reasonably sized, are geared to more classical chemical threats, and the ability to expand their capabilities to a broader range of emerging threats is uncertain. Recently, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS), employed in a sensor format, has shown enormous potential to address these ever-changing threats. PAS is one of the more flexible IR spectroscopy variants, and that flexibility allows for the construction of sensors that are designed for specific tasks. PAS is well suited for trace detection of gaseous and condensed media. Recent research has employed quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) in combination with MEMS-scale photoacoustic cell designs. The continuous tuning capability of QCLs over a broad wavelength range in the mid-infrared spectral region greatly expands the number of compounds that can be identified. We will discuss our continuing evaluation of QCL technology as it matures in relation to our ultimate goal of a universal compact chemical sensor platform. Finally, expanding on our previously reported photoacoustic detection of condensed phase samples, we are investigating standoff photoacoustic chemical detection of these materials. We will discuss the evaluation of a PAS sensor that has been designed around increasing operator safety during detection and identification of explosive materials by performing sensing operations at a standoff distance.

Here, we detail, through experiment and computational simulation, the interfacial contact between four common traps and five commonly investigated surfaces encountered in explosives detection applications associated with airport security. The Young's modulus and hardness of four traps and seven substrates were measured using nanoindentation. These properties determine how deformation occurs when traps are applied for contact sampling of explosives. The nanoindentation data were analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method, and an indenter area function was created using silicon and gold as the reference materials. The Young's moduli of the traps ranged from 0.2 to 8 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.5 to 4 GPa. The hardness values of the traps ranged from 0.005 to 0.22 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 GPa. For each of 20 scenarios (4 traps, 5 surfaces), six contact simulations were performed. In these contact simulations, the Greenwood-Willliamson microcontact model was used to represent the behavior of the asperities on the traps, while the Timoshenko Beam model was used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the bulk trap materials spanning the space between asperities. This combination of feature- and trap-scale modeling provides a more realistic description of the interfacial contact than either model applied individually. The calculated distributions of separation distances between the traps and surfaces when the traps were contacted with the surfaces under a normal load were compared to estimate the relative effectiveness of the traps at interrogating the topography of the surfaces. This method is proposed as a tool to guide the development of trap materials for surface sampling and surface cleaning applications. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84961345096"
