Many of the advantages of µPADs, however, are limited to work in a laboratory setting due to the difficulties of processing data when using electronic devices in the field. This review focuses on the use of µPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The µPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85050459634"

Several configurations of an Explosives Detection System (EDS) to intercept hidden threats, made up with a Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) compact neutron generator and NaI (Tl) scintillation detectors, have been evaluated using MCNP6 code. The system's response to various samples of explosives, such as RDX and Ammonium Nitrate, is analysed. The D-D generator is able to produce fast neutrons with 2.5 MeV energy in a maximum yield of 1010 n/s. It is surrounded by high-density polyethylene to thermalize the fast neutrons and to optimize interactions with the sample inspected, whose emission of gamma rays gives a characteristic spectrum of the elements that constitute it. This procedure allows to determine its chemical composition and to identify the type of substance. The necessary shielding is evaluated to estimate its thicknesses depending on the admissible dose of operation, using lead and polyethylene. The results show that its functionality is promising in the field of national security for explosives inspection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85042643644"

An ion swarm could be mobility isolated in the first drift region using synchronized dual ion shutters and decomposed in a wire grid assembly using electric fields of 1.80 × 104 V cm-1 (118 Td) from a 1.8 MHz sinusoidal waveform. Mobility selected ions that underwent field induced decomposition were NO3-, from PETN·Cl- and NG·Cl-, and NO2- from RDX·Cl-. The extent of decomposition ranged from 60 to 90%, depending on gas temperature, field strength, and ion identity, introducing additional controls to improve selectivity in trace determination of explosives. Ion transmission through the wire grid assembly ranged from 80 to >95% with losses increasing for increased field strength.

Therefore, systematic studies are essential to optimize the performance of sensors. In this work, we have explored β-octamethoxyporphyrin and β-octabutoxyporphyrin to evaluate the effect of alkoxy groups in solution and in vapor phase sensing of nitrated explosives. Our systematic studies revealed a marked difference in sensitivity of these free-base porphyrins in solution state and vapor phase sensing of nitrated explosives simply by modulation of alkyl chain lengths. Alkoxyporphyrins exhibit very good sensitivity towards not only nitro aromatics but also alkyl nitro explosive taggants compared to β-octaethylporphyrin.

The addition of an organic base was found to be critical for achieving fast conversion reactions and the formation of the phenoxide anions. Addition of a nitrile group to the fluorenyl boronate ester moiety improved the stability of the material to photooxidation, increased the photoluminescence quantum yields, and enhanced the absorption and emission shifts to longer wavelengths.

Raman spectroscopy has been used in similar studies, but no study has been published which is based on measurement of reflectance from hyperspectral sensor for trace detection of explosives. HSI used in this study has an advantage over existing techniques due to its combination of imaging system and spectroscopy, along with being contactless and non-destructive in nature. Hyperspectral images of the chemical were collected using the BaySpec hyperspectral sensor which operated in the spectral range of 400–1000 nm (144 bands). Image processing was applied on the acquired hyperspectral image to select the region of interest (ROI) and to extract the spectral reflectance of the chemicals which were stored as spectral library. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and first derivative was applied to reduce the high dimensionality of the image and to determine the optimal wavelengths between 400 and 1000 nm. In total, 22 out of 144 wavelengths were selected by analysing the loadings of principal components (PC). SVM was used to develop the classification model. SVM model established on the whole spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm achieved an accuracy of 81.11%, whereas an accuracy of 77.17% with less computational load was achieved when SVM model was established on the optimal wavelengths selected. The results of the study demonstrate that the hyperspectral imaging system along with SVM is a promising tool for trace detection of explosives. © 2018 by the authors.

TEX has high application value in casting and press-packed explosives. A TEX supercell model was constructed using the reaction molecular dynamics (MD) method. Based on the ReaxFF/lg reactive force field, an MD simulation of the thermal decomposition process of TEX explosives at different temperatures (2000 K, 2500 K, 3000 K, and 3500 K) was performed. The calculations were carried out to analyze the initial reaction pathways, small molecule products, destruction of the TEX cage structure and formation of clusters. The structural characteristics and elemental composition of the clusters were studied, and the reaction kinetic parameters of TEX at different reaction stages were calculated. During the thermal decomposition process, the N–NO2 bond in the TEX molecular structure breaks first, then the adjacent C–O bond is stretched, and finally the cage structure is gradually destroyed. The main decomposition products are small molecules (NO2, NO, H2O, CO2, N2, H2, HNO2 and HNO) and clusters (C12H12N6O12 and C18H13N7O14). The effect of temperature on the clusters is twofold. On the one hand, when the temperature is low, the cage structure of the TEX molecule is difficult to destroy and is not conducive to cluster growth. On the other hand, when the temperature is high, clusters are generated in the TEX supercell system but are subsequently rapidly decomposed. Throughout the whole process, H, N and O will gradually escape from the cluster, but O is more confined to the cluster, which will affect the subsequent autoxidation process of TEX to some extent. © 2019 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85060954789"

In particular, the electrostatic discharge sensitivity (E                             50                             ) value (9 mJ) is 180 times higher than that of the original copper azide powder (0.05 mJ) and the static electricity accumulation value (Q) is 430 times lower than that of copper azide powder (0.04 vs 17.2 nC g                             -1                             ). As the proof of concept, the copper azide film is further assembled in a micro-initiation device, which can successfully detonate the secondary explosives CL-20. Additionally, the superhydrophobic surface of the CA-C film@PF merit the initiation power even after being soaked in water.                          © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85062372759"

The instrument was designed in a compact form due to the integration of a modularized structure and a single unified control system, which was ultimately restricted to a size of 420 mm × 520 mm × 650 mm, suitable for field applications. An orthogonal optical system was used to focus the laser beams and obtain the spectra and real-time imaging of the tested area. A pulsed laser (1064 nm, 100 mJ, 1–20 Hz) and a continuous-wave laser (532 nm, 22 mW) were applied for LIBS and Raman measurements, respectively. The multichannel original equipment manufactured spectrometer ensures a wide spectral range (185–850 nm for LIBS and 400–4000 cm                             −1                              for Raman) on the basis of its low weight. A central control circuit board was specially developed by integrating the control command and data transmission to achieve centralized control of the components, thereby providing precise timing control and improving the instrument. The enclosed sample chamber had the function of mapping and shielding the fill gas. The developed client software provided a comprehensive operation interface.

The thermal stability in low temperature also couldn’t be described by the decomposition kinetics of the temperatures higher than the temperature of melt. Thermogravimetric (TG) measures the sample’s mass loss in the process of the thermal decomposition which will reduce the impact of the melting process to a certain extent.

Based on the experimental data of TG, the kinetic model and parameters of the thermal decomposition of HMX was studied by the multivariate nonlinear regression method. The isothermal DSC test has certain advantages for studying the thermal behavior of materials at low temperature.

However, this interpretation has been proved to be wrong by the present theoretical DFT/TDDFT explorations. Actually, the strong fluorescence of HPICI is mainly induced by the local excitation of the enol form HPICI(E) without ESIPT, and the fluorescence quenching by TNP is due to the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process together with the cooperative effect of hydrogen-bonding interaction and π-π stacking interaction coexisting in the HPICI-TNP complex.

The study was carried out at a different weight percentage of GP within TNT with respect to the two excitation wavelengths of 532 nm and 1064 nm (30 ps, 10 Hz, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser). The equal and double proportional matrix of the GP and TNT (solid samples) generate a strong PA signal with high quality factor (Q-factor) due to the interaction of optical phonons of GP and TNT in the same phase. The Raman spectra, recorded at 785 nm wavelength provides an insight on the pi-electron coupling between the GP and TNT. The obtained experimental results confirm that the pure GP and its derivatives, which have a SP2/SP3 hybridization, can be used to develop a new sensing optode for the detection and identification of explosive molecules in the visible and near-IR wavelengths range. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85051004492"

The characterization and classification of residual smokeless powers may allow for a known sample, i.e. sample collected from a suspect, to be connected to an unknown sample, i.e. sample obtained from a crime scene. In this study, thirty-four (34) smokeless powders were analyzed using GC–MS and DART-TOFMS to determine how comparable the discriminatory power of each instrument was based on the smokeless powder constituents identified within each sample. Analysis of smokeless powders by DART-TOFMS generated comparable results to GC–MS in a fraction of the time (∼30 seconds). Most peaks observed between the instruments were the same; however, N-nitroso-DPA was only observed in the DART-TOFMS spectra but was not a significant contributor. Samples were naturally grouped together using hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis, based on underlying features in the resulting spectra. Samples were placed into groupings based on significant peaks observed and relative intensities. Classification models were presented for both GC–MS and DART-TOFMS and subsequently tested and compared. The classification models used in this study were linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest modeling. The groups observed were similar between the two instruments, indicating that DART-TOFMS provides comparable data to GC–MS and could be used as a rapid screening technique. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85053846836"

After the dismantlement of a nuclear warhead, the separated explosive needs authentication that it comes from the dismantled nuclear warhead. In this paper, the Monte Carlo numerical simulation method was used to study the feasibility and result of determining the source of the explosive by analyzing the nuclide abundances of the explosive and determining the age of the explosive (calculated since the explosive was placed in the nuclear warhead). First, the JMCT software was used to analyze the nuclei produced by the neutron reactions in the explosive of the nuclear warhead. As a result, it was found that 14C is the most promising to be used to determine the source of the explosive. Second, the relationships between the average abundance of 14C and the age of the explosive, the spatial distribution of the 14C abundance in the explosive were calculated by using the JMCT software. Finally, it is found that, compared to the WgPu warheads (nuclear warheads with weapons-grade plutonium cores), the 14C abundances of the explosives of the WgU warheads (nuclear warheads with weapons-grade uranium cores) are much lower (the ages of the explosives are the same), and it is more difficult to measure the latter; for the WgPu warheads with the structures based on Model 3 and Model 4 (the warhead models employed were proposed by Steve Fetter), it can be determined that whether the separated explosives come from the dismantled nuclear warheads or are common ones (or the fake ones prepared by the verified party) after the dismantlement of the nuclear warheads by measuring the 14C abundances in the explosives (including the average abundances and the spatial distributions of the abundances) and determining the ages of the explosives, which realizes the source authentication of the explosives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85055262424"

The underlying principle is to use D-T (14.1 MeV) neutrons tagged by its associated charged particle and incorporating neutron time-of-flight technique to identify explosives by estimating carbon, nitrogen and oxygen contents and their ratios. This research was carried out to facilitate the design and construction of a prototype laboratory based TNM system and a simulation model was developed in the GEANT4 framework. The model has established an environment for (a) simulating production of D-T tagged neutrons, their transport and interactions with an object to induce emission, detection of characteristic gamma-rays and (b) image reconstruction (3D) of the interrogated object using time-of-flight information of neutron and gamma-ray. The geometrical configuration includes 14.1 MeV tagged neutrons, a position sensitive alpha detector and an array of BGO (3” x 3”) gamma detectors arranged in a square geometry around the sample to collect the neutron induced gamma-ray spectra.

The emission spectra were analysed by modelling of the background radiation and the characteristic emission of all molecular emitters in the reaction of Al/CuO. Based on this, the particles′ surface and gas phase temperature, the emissivity and the radiation of energy was determined by a non-linear least squares fit between experimental and modelled spectra. This work presents the first modelling of the diatomic band system of Cu2 and CuO.

Thermal desorption – direct analysis in real time – high resolution mass spectrometry (TD-DART-HRMS) is a novel technique in which an independent thermal desorption unit is coupled to a DART-HRMS. In this study, TD-DART-HRMS is compared with traditional DART-HRMS for smokeless powder analysis. Samples were extracted to minimize sample variability and allow for simple, direct comparison between techniques. Chemometric statistical approaches were applied for the comparison of TD-DART-HRMS and DART-HRMS. Sorensen correlation was applied for direct comparison of spectra, and positive ionization mode mass spectra were found to be more highly correlated than the negative ionization mode spectra, indicating greater similarity among DART-HRMS and TD-DART-HRMS spectra in the positive ionization mode. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was utilized for the formation of groupings based on underlying features in the spectra, and classification modeling was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) along with introducing an external test set to the LDA model. High potential for classification was observed in the LDA modeling with 20% withheld cross validation. External test set validation demonstrated that the TD-DART-HRMS model was a more robust model than the DART-HRMS model, with a higher classification accuracy observed.

The following test compounds were selected: morphine (gives protonated ion, (M+H)+); hexogen, RDX (forms adducts with anion of chlorine or nitrate ion); and trinitrotoluene, TNT (gives deprotonated ion, (M-H)-). The test compounds were dissolved in water, acetonitrile or ethanol. It is shown that in the ABDI mass spectra of a number of compounds (protonated morphine ions in water and RDX adducts with chlorine in acetonitrile), the ratios I2/I1 and I3/I2 linearly depend on the analyte concentration in the solution. This is evident throughout the range of measured concentrations, when monomers and dimers are simultaneously visible in the mass spectrum. The phenomenon can be roughly explained by the dimerization of analyte molecules in singly charged parent drops during ABDI ionization. The linearity of the I2/I1 and I3/I2 on the concentration can be used for estimation of the analyte concentration in a sample without using an internal or external standard.

Common inorganic components of black powders (e.g., sulfur and potassium nitrate) as well as the alternative and additional organic and inorganic components of common black powder substitutes (e.g., dicyandiamide, ascorbic acid, sodium benzoate, guanidine nitrate, and potassium perchlorate) were detected from polytetrafluoroethylene-coated fiberglass collection wipes with no additional sample preparation.

Many pure and composite metal fuels used in these applications have been observed to microexplode during combustion. This causes particles to fragment, revealing fresh surfaces, which may enhance burn rates and efficiencies. Despite these potential benefits, few have attempted to control the bubbling and the microexplosion of metal powders as they combust in molten states. Here, we choose Al:Zr composite powders as a representative system to study bubbling and microexplosions and to identify active mechanisms. Using synchrotron x-rays and phase contrast imaging, we observe molten metal particles of various sizes as they burn in air at temperatures ranging from 2700 to 3500 K. We characterize bubble nucleation and growth in the interior of the particles during the combustion process, and we identify heterogeneous nucleation, slow growth and coalescence of bubbles, as well as rapid bubble growth leading to microexplosions. Bubble growth rates and Laplace pressures are calculated, and we find that during slow expansion growth rates are similar to classical predictions of bubble growth in superheated liquids. For rapid expansions we find that a critical growth rate of ∼0.5 m s−1, independent of the initial particle size, is necessary to enable microexplosions. We calculate the rate of gas generation that is needed to enable this growth and we conclude that nitrogen is the gas most likely driving rapid bubble growth and fragmentation. These results provide the first in situ observations of the mechanisms that control bubbling and microexplosions during the combustion of metal particles. © 2018 The Combustion Institute","2-s2.0-85055745487"

Tb:Eu@MOF was carefully characterized by means of micromorphology, XRD, N2 adsorption and desorption. Detailed analysis on its photophysical performance indicated weak Tb emission and strong Eu emission, owing to the energy competing between two kinds of rare earth ions in Tb:Eu@MOF. After meeting PA, such energy competing was blocked, leading to enhanced Tb emission and decreased Eu emission. Ratiometric fluorescent sensing for PA detection was thus constructed with good selectivity and low LOD (limit of detection) of 0.87 μM. Linear sensing response was achieved.

In this paper, the basic principles and mathematical model of this method are first introduced, and the calculation formula of the element number ratio (the ratio between the nucleus numbers of two different elements) of the concealed explosive is deduced. Second, a numerical simulation platform of this method was established based on the Monte Carlo JMCT code. By calibrating the absorption efficiencies of the explosive device to γ rays, the element number ratios of a concealed explosive model under the irradiation of thermal neutrons were reconstructed from the neutron capture prompt γ-ray spectrum. The reconstruction values were in good agreement with the actual values, which shows that this method has a high reconstruction precision of the element number ratio for concealed explosives. Lastly, it was demonstrated using the simulation study that this method can discriminate explosives, drugs, and common materials, with the capability of determining the existence of concealed bulk explosives and identifying explosive types. © 2019, China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

It is largely used for the detection of specific ions such as small molecule explosives. IMS detection system includes the use of e. g. a Faraday cupor mass spectrometry (MS). The presence of interfering ion signals in standalone IMS may lead to the detection of false positives or negatives due to e. g. lacking resolving power. In this case, selective mobility shifts obtained using shift reagents (SR), i. e. ligands complexing a specific target, can bring help.

The aim of this paper is to present an efficient interplay of experimental ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMMS) and predictive computational chemistry using various levels of computational efforts for rationally designing target-specific SR. Mass spectrometry is used to evaluate the efficiency of the SR selectivity with identification and semi-quantification of free and complexed ions.

An easy-to-use and low-cost gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based colorimetric sensor was developed for the determination of nitroaromatic explosives, i.e., trinitrotoluene (TNT) and tetryl, capable of analyte detection at picomolar (pM) levels. The sensor nanoparticles were synthesized by functionalizing the negatively charged thioglycolic acid (TGA)-modified AuNPs with positively charged (±)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) at a carefully calculated pH. The working principle of the sensor is charge-transfer (CT) interaction between the electron-rich free amino (-NH2) group of DACH and the electron-deficient -NO2 groups of TNT/tetryl, added to possible nanoparticle agglomerization via electrostatic interaction of TNT-Meisenheimer anions with more than one cationic DACH-modified AuNP. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the sensor were 1.76 pM and 5.87 pM for TNT and 1.74 pM and 5.80 pM for tetryl, respectively. TNT, tetryl, and tetrytol, extracted from a nitroaromatic explosive-contaminated soil sample, were determined with the proposed sensor, yielding good recoveries. The sensor could be selectively applied to various mixtures of TNT with common energetic materials such as RDX, HMX, and PETN. Additionally, common soil ions (Cl-, NO3 -, SO4 2-, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Al3+) as well as detergents, sugar, sweeteners, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), caffeine, and paracetamol-based painkiller drugs, which may be used as camouflage materials for explosives, either had no adverse effects or removable interferences on the detection method.

Researchers are limited by the accuracy of previous K0 value reference measurements on which to base their calibrations. Any inaccuracy in these reference K0 values, typically ±2%, will propagate through to the calculated K0 value of the COI. For this reason, there is a need to standardize reference K0 values with improved accuracy.

Geant4 simulations were used for generating neutrons at 14 MeV energy and tracking them through the scattering off the explosive embedded in soil. Si-PIN photodiodes were used as detector elements in the design for their low costs and simplicity for signal readout electronics. Various neutron-charge particle converters were applied on to the surface of the photodiodes to increase the detection efficiency. Si-PIN photodiodes coated with 6LiF provided the best result for a certain energy interval. Energy depositions in silicon detector from all secondary particles generated including photons were taken into account to generate a realistic background. Humidity of soil, one of the most important parameter for limiting the detection, was also studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85034117619"

This is clearly justified if the spectral features in the spectrum are very narrow (for example infra-red spectra of gas samples). However there is a plethora of samples (in the liquid and especially in the solid form) where there is a natural spectral peak broadening due to collisions and proximity predominately. Additionally there is a number of portable devices (spectrometers) with inherently restricted spectral resolution, spectral range or both, which are extremely useful in some field applications (archaeology, agriculture, food industry, cultural heritage, forensic science). In this paper the investigation of the influence of spectral resolution, spectral range and signal-to-noise ratio on the identification of high explosive substances by applying multivariate statistical methods on the Fourier transform infra-red spectral data sets is studied.

To this end, a new triarylamine-cored dendritic gelator (OGR) was synthesized, which produced thermoreversible, thixotropic, and fluorescent gels in n-octanol. On gelation, both π–π* transitions and the emission peak of the gelator show redshifts with a 4.5-fold increase of fluorescence intensity in the gel state indicating J-aggregation. The nitrogen lone-pair electrons of OGR make it a donor, and electron transfer occurs to acceptor nitroaromatics causing fluorescence quenching, which is further promoted due to its acidity. The Stern–Volmer rate constants measured for different nitroaromatics showed that it senses picric acid (PA) best. The contact-mode technique with OGR-treated paper strips can allow naked-eye detection of PA under UV light down to 10−11 m concentration within 30 s. Reusability of the gel is achieved by treating OGR@PAx with NaOH solution. Impedance spectroscopic results indicated a decrease of both charge-transport resistance and Warburg impedance on successive addition of PA. The limits of detection of PA determined from fluorescence and impedance measurements match well.

The typical particle size of the GO dots was 42 nm. The fluorescent characteristics of the GO dots were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Once excited at 360 nm, the GO dots were fluorescent in the range of 450-550 nm, which was dependent on the excitation wavelength. Further, GO dots were effectively utilized for multifarious applications such as photoinduced electron transfer and detection of explosives and biomolecules. The emission property of GO dots was competently quenched by viologens, picric acid (PA), and bilirubin (BR). The mechanism of quenching by viologens and explosives/biomolecules was found to be due to photoinduced electron transfer and the internal filter effect, respectively.

It has been shown that the mass loss processes of NG, TMETN and TMPTN are more dependent on the heating rate, and the simultaneous evaporation makes the initial temperatures for their mass loss lower than those of the other nitric esters. Based on the correlations among their thermal stability, activation energy, detonation velocity and heat of combustion, one could conclude that the oxygen coefficient (α) plays a positive role on the decomposition heat release efficiency (ηd) when it is less than one, whereas when the α is greater than or equals to one, the fuel elements such as C and H contents would play a decisive role on ηd. It has been further proved that the order of contribution rate of function groups on the tertiary carbon to the detonation velocity could be –CH3 < –NO2 < –C2H5 < –ONO2. In addition, the introduction of function groups to the tertiary carbon is in favor of increasing the thermal stability of nitric esters due to increase in symmetry and rigidity of their molecules.

We show that a successful and reliable identification can be made using the single long-duration THz signal, which contains not only the main reflected pulse, but also several sub-pulses. The method does not use averaging of the measured THz signals over the viewing angles and scanning over the surface area, which significantly increases the signal processing speed. The identification is based on the method of spectral dynamics analysis together with the integral correlation criteria (ICC). We compare the absorption spectral dynamics of a substance under analysis with the corresponding dynamics for a standard substance from database. For reliable and effective substance detection, we propose to use several ICC simultaneously in different time intervals, which contain not only the main pulse of the reflected THz signal, but also the sub-pulses. This way, one can detect and identify the substance in the sample with high probability. As examples of identification, we used the THz signals reflected from the plastic explosive PWM C4 with both rough and concave surface.

The corresponding limits of detection were 25 μg L-1 for TNT, 30 μg L-1 for DNT, and 10 μg L-1 for both RDX and HMX, using nitro-energetic memory-GC/P(Cz-co-ANI)-Aunano electrodes. These electrodes were used separately, and specific determinations were made in various mixtures of nitro-energetic materials. The developed method could be efficiently used in electroanalyzing nitroaromatics and nitramines in military explosives (i.e., comp B, octol, and comp A5). The sensor electrodes were specific for the tested nitro-energetic compounds and did not respond to paracetamol-caffeine-based analgesic drug, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), sweetener, and sugar that can be used as camouflage materials in passenger belongings. The developed method was statistically validated against the standard LC-MS reference method in contaminated clay soil samples containing TNT and RDX explosives. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-85047538841"

UV–vis spectroscopy has been used to analyze the degree of molecular aggregation and stability of the porphyrins in the films. The comparison between the three macrocycles has shown that even though the porphyrin Triad can reduce the molecular aggregation and gain stability in films prepared by spin coating in comparison with TPP films, TPPOH forms the least aggregated and most stable films over the porphyrins used in this work. Absorbance response of porphyrins films towards explosive vapors has been analyzed through their exposure to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) as testing vapor, featuring relatively small and slow spectral changes. Moreover, these absorbance responses have made evident the detrimental effect of molecular aggregation over the sensing capabilities of the porphyrins. However, exposure of porphyrins films to DNT, 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) has resulted in a fast, intense, reversible and repetitive quenching of the fluorescence in all cases, with the monomeric TPPOH exhibiting the best sensing performance among the three compounds. Surprisingly, TPP has shown a relatively large and fast fluorescence response that indicates that aggregation may not affect much the sensing capabilities of porphyrins in terms of fluorescence responses, in contrast to the absorbance responses. This fact has been explained by the lack of emission of H and J-aggregates in the porphyrin films. Finally, although the Triad has featured the slowest quenching response compared to the other two porphyrins, its quenching percentage is in some extent dependent on the type of nitroaromatic, which could be interpreted as a possible ability of Triad to respond more selectively towards explosive vapors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85039969549"

For this, the DADP-C4 and DADP-C2 isotopomers were synthesized from acetone labeled isotopically in the methyl and the carbonyl carbon atoms, respectively. The acetone and DADP-isotopomer compounds were characterized using Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Theoretical assignments were taken from previous studies on the potential energy distribution of a vibrational mode, which provide an approach to the internal coordinates related to each band. The selective isotopic labeling allowed us to approach to the dependence of each band, because the energy of a molecular vibration also depends on the reciprocal mass of the atoms involved. In general, the results showed that some bands assigned experimentally do not coincide with the theoretical assignments by quantum mechanical simulations. © The author.","2-s2.0-85055987257"

It turns out that GAPE is compatible with GAP.

Herein, we present a novel and simple method for simultaneous determination of DPA and its nitro derivatives in solid propellants using UV-Vis spectroscopy and chemometrics techniques. The UV-Vis spectra of the analytes revealed strong overlap and it was difficult to determine them individually in their mixture without any separation and purification. To tackle the overlapping problem in collected spectra, analysis of first-order UV-Vis data was performed using multivariate calibration techniques. In this way, principle component regression (PCR), different modes of partial least square (PLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) have been used for correlating the collected spectra to the concentration of DPAs in synthetic and real samples. The important variables were selected by confining the L1-norm of the regression coefficients in multivariate model via the shrinkage and selection operator in LASSO approach. The results obtained by LASSO regression technique in this work were superior to those obtained by different modes of PLS algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that LASSO can be used as a reliable variable selection and modeling technique in multivariate calibration studies. Generally, the proposed strategy in this work is simple, non-destructive, low-cost and rapid and can be effectively applied for simultaneous determination of DPA and its nitro derivatives in solid propellants. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Conventional detection methods can hardly detect RDX, and no direct vapor detection has been reported based on a fluorescence method because RDX has no aromatic rings and hence it does not have a strong enough interaction with the fluorescent probe. By the introduction of Boc-NH- into the side chain terminal of polyfluorene, a conjugated polymer probe, PF6-Boc, has been designed and synthesized. The probe showed 91% fluorescence quenching in saturated RDX vapor and retained a 66% quenching response even after 8 cycles. A respectable ultrasensitive detection limit of 0.041 ppt was obtained. From simulated landmine detection experiments (RDX buried under sand), the probe showed a significant black quenching spot on the fluorescent filter paper within 5 min and the quenching spots became darker over time, even though the explosives were isolated in the soil and the air flow had a negative effect. The ultra-sensitive sensing performance, reusability and excellent performance in simulation experiments all demonstrate the great potential of PF6-Boc for the direct and on-site detection of RDX.

The stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios (15N/14N and 18O/16O, expressed as δ15N and δ18O) of AN have the potential to aid in forensic investigations by providing supplemental properties for sample-to-sample comparison in materials which are otherwise chemically identical. The forensic utility of stable isotope analyses depends on demonstrated variation between different sources and minimal variation within a source. To test the variability within a single manufacturer (here considered a source), a total of 26 samples representing two production time periods and two product lines were analyzed for bulk δ15N and δ18O. Additionally, because AN is known to have a modest isotopic range, a potassium nitrate precipitation method was developed to separate the component ions (NO3- and NH4+) for individual δ15N analysis and increased discriminatory power. The average δ15N and δ18O of bulk AN (− 0.10‰ and + 22.8‰, respectively) is similar to the isotopic signature of atmospheric N2 and O2, the starting reactants in AN production.

Conversely, the NH4+ δ15N remained relatively consistent over time. Furthermore, whereas samples in the two product lines produced on the same day in June are isotopically similar, there are isotopic differences between samples in the two product lines manufactured within 6 h of each other in November. The observed variability could be useful in comparing AN from two or more bombs, or a bomb and a stash of AN in a suspect's possession, but the observed lot-to-lot differences within one manufacturer could complicate attribution efforts. In contrast, the NH4+ δ15N values, which appear to be the most consistent over time within this factory, need to be further explored as a potentially reliable signal. © 2017","2-s2.0-85029317734"

Addressing these challenges, we demonstrate a versatile surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform capable of multiphasic, reliable detection with ultrahigh sensitivity. The SERS platform is extremely sensitive and relies on vapor molecules present at the solid-vapor or liquid-vapor interface for reliable detection in ambient conditions (298 K, 1 atm). We observe that metal nanoparticles, subjected to a temperature gradient, migrate and self-assemble into precise nanoparticle assemblies, in a nanoscale analogue of Soret effect. The formation and monodispersity of these nanoparticles assemblies, termed Soret colloids (SCs), is kinetically controllable using the thermal gradient. Soret colloids exhibit excellent size uniformity (monodispersity index, MDI ∼ 0.8) and strong interplasmon coupling to generate uniform and intense electromagnetic hot-spots enabling multiphasic, reliable (relative standard deviation, RSD < 5%), instantaneous (<60 s), ambient (298 K, 1 atm) and spectroscopic detection through SERS.

Here we measured the carbon (13C/12C) and hydrogen (2H/1H) isotope ratios of the oft-illicitly manufactured explosive triacetone triperoxide, TATP, and one of its precursors, acetone. As acetone is the sole source of carbon and hydrogen to TATP, a survey of acetone from 12 countries was conducted to explore the breadth of 13C/12C and 2H/1H variation in the precursor, and therefore, its product. Carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios were measured using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) techniques. We observed greater ranges in both C and H isotope ratios of acetone than previously published; we also found that country-of-purchase was a large contributing factor to the observed variation, larger than acetone grade and brand. Following clandestine production methods, we observed that the stable isotope ratios of TATP retained the stable isotope signatures of acetone used in synthesis.

The AFT provides reaction times of between 3 and 5 s with flows of 6 L/min, enabling detection levels, after thermal desorption, similar to those previously demonstrated for RDX vapor in the low parts per quadrillion range. The thermal desorption of chlorate and perchlorate salts resulted in the production of the corresponding anions which have higher electron affinities than that of the nitrate reactant ions. A dielectric barrier discharge, used as the ionization source, produced the nitrate reactant ions. In some instances, the molecular salt formed adducts with the nitrate, chlorate, and/or perchlorate anions, giving insight into the original identity of the salt cation. Urea nitrate, guanidine nitrate, and potassium nitrate were also detected as adducts with the nitrate reactant ion. The direct room-temperature vapor detection of urea nitrate and hydrogen peroxide, which have relatively high vapor pressures compared to the other salts in this study, is also demonstrated. Room-temperature vapor detection of chlorate and perchlorate salts is possible by the addition of a dilute acid which converts the salt into a more volatile acidic form.

Its reactive hazards have been widely studied for several years. However, many large accidents involving AN still happened frequently in the recent years. It is found that, for accidents in storage or transportation, the thermal runaway is a major factor. The main objective of the research is to examine the effect of potassium chloride (KCl) on the thermal stability of AN under acidic conditions. The thermal stability of samples was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC), the Cook-off test and the Dewar test. The results indicate that KCl can significantly reduce the thermal stability of AN under acidic conditions. The catalytic effect of KCl on the decomposition of AN is limited without acidic conditions. The scale effect also is important factor to influence the thermal stability of AN. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85031894464"

An ambient pressure laser desorption (APLD) mass spectrometer is introduced for this scenario, which enables detecting substances on surfaces without sample pretreatment. It is especially useful for substances with low vapor pressure and thermolabile ones. The APLD allows for the separation of desorption and ionization into two steps and, therefore, both can be optimized separately. Within this work, an improved version of the developed system is shown that achieves limits of detection (LOD) down to 500 pg while remaining fast and flexible. Furthermore, realistic scenarios are applied to prove the usability of this system in real-world issues. For this purpose, post-blast residues of a bomb from the SecondWorldWar were analyzed, and the presence of PETN was proven without sample pretreatment. In addition, the analyzable substance range could be expanded by various drugs and drug precursors. Thus, the presented instrumentation can be utilized for an increased number of forensically important compound classes without changing the setup. Drug precursors revealed a LOD ranging from 6 to 100 ng.

The scale effect and water effect both play an important role in the thermal stability of ANE and EE. The measured decomposition temperatures of ANE and EE in MVPT are 146°C and 144°C, respectively, much lower than those in DSC and ARC. As the size of the same sample in DSC, ARC, and MVPT successively increases, the onset temperatures decrease. In the same test, the measured onset temperature value of ANE is higher than that of EE.

Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism and characteristics of thermal decomposition of CL-20. In this study, a ϵ-CL-20 supercell was constructed and ReaxFF-lg reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate thermal decomposition of ϵ-CL-20 at various temperatures (2000, 2500, 2750, 3000, 3250, and 3500 K). The mechanism of thermal decomposition of CL-20 was analyzed from the aspects of potential energy evolution, the primary reactions, and the intermediate and final product species. The effect of temperature on thermal decomposition of CL-20 is also discussed. The initial reaction path of thermal decomposition of CL-20 is N-NO2 cleavage to form NO2, followed by C-N cleavage, leading to the destruction of the cage structure. A small number of clusters appear in the early reactions and disappear at the end of the reactions. The initial reaction path of CL-20 decomposition is the same at different temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the decomposition rate of CL-20 increases and the cage structure is destroyed earlier.

In contrast, 3-Oxime-7-dimethylamino-coumarin (3-ODC) exhibits a unique turn-off response with strong fluorescence quenching (about 98%) as a result of a twisted intramolecular charge transfer mechanism (TICT).

To further check it, nonaromatic polyurethanes (PUs) bearing carbamate (NHCOO) groups were designed and synthesized. While being virtually nonemissive in dilute PU/DMF solutions, PUs are found to be highly emissive when concentrated or aggregated as powders and films. Furthermore, room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is detected from the solid powders and films. Clustering of NHCOO groups and electronic communications among carbonyl (CO) units, N and O atoms are accountable for the emission.

The variation in electrical resistance was used as the mechanism by which the sensor responded to the concentration of explosive vapor. Polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The results showed that the fabricated PPy nanoparticles have a near spherical morphology with an average size of around 56 nm. The surface of the sensor template was then coated with a layer of nanocomposite composed of the synthesized PPy nanoparticles and carbowax polymer. Calibration and performance testing of the fabricated sensors were carried out with a special setup designed for explosive vapor generation under static conditions. The developed sensor was able to sense different concentrations of the explosive (0.5-100 ppm). The coated sensor showed a linear response in the concentration range of 0.5-50 ppm. The results showed that the designed sensor had a favorable sensitivity to the explosive. The calibration curve and sensitivity of the fabricated carbowax/PPy sensor was also determined in the explosive vapor concentration range of 0.5-50 ppm of 2,4-DNT under static conditions. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-85029163411"

Propellant can be used as initiator in explosive mixtures along with other components such as coal, ammonium nitrate, sulfur, etc. The identification of the propellant's brand used in homemade explosives can provide additional forensic information of this evidence. In this work, four of the most common propellant brands were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) which is a non-destructive micro-analytical technique. Spectra shows characteristic signals of typical compounds in the propellants, such as nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, guanidine, diphenylamine, etc. The differentiation of propellant components was achieved by using FTIR-PAS combined with chemometric methods of classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) and soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) were used to achieve an effective differentiation and classification (100%) of propellant brands.

All the solid COPs show high luminescent intensity, owing to the extended π conjugated systems in the synthesized COPs. By exploring the luminescent quenching property of COPs for nitro explosives, we find that all the COPs exhibit high selectivity for detecting PA, especially for COP-612. Further study indicates that even in the presence of other nitroaromatic explosives, COP-612 still exhibits high selectivity for detecting PA, i.e., the competitive nitro explosives show no influence on the sensing property of COP-612 for PA, which suggests that COP-612 is an excellent candidate for selectively detecting PA in practical applications.

Selective detection of TNT from other nitroaromatics is still challenging as it possess similar chemical structure and properties with its analogues.

The PEI CuNC with size less than 3 nm was prepared via a simple one pot microwave method and exhibited bright blue emission at 480 nm. The fluorescence of PEI CuNC can be remarkably quenched by TNT through the formation of amine-TNT Meisenheimer complex. Quenching was further facilitated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and inner filter effect (IFE). A good linearity was observed for the PEI CuNC based fluorescence detection of TNT with limit of detection 14 pM. Meanwhile the formation of Meisenheimer complex resulted in a significant colour change of the solution from pale green to red, which enables visual detection of TNT with detection limit down to 0.05 nM.

Screening activities to detect traces of explosives are heavily focused on wipe collection from surfaces such as fabrics, metals, and plastics with speed and efficacy as the goals. Studies to improve the sampling protocols, including development of improved wipe materials and selection of best surfaces, depend upon the availability of test materials that mimic particles in fingerprints made after handling explosives. RDX particle arrays were prepared by drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates and then transferred by rubbing onto target surfaces. The particle size distributions in the transferred deposits approximately match the distributions measured from fingerprints (size range of 1 to 40 μm) for equivalent total masses of RDX, and the transfer is better than 95% efficient to three realistic surfaces; woven nylon, synthetic leather, and brushed steel. DOD inkjet printing can be tailored to produce the desired particle sizes by changing the total deposit mass at each point in the array. Deposits will not transfer efficiently to surfaces smoother than the PTFE transfer substrate.

The films were deposited by an Organic Molecular Evaporation and a DC magnetron sputtering. The growth of metallic nanoparticles was continuously monitored through in-situ resistance measurements to detect the percolation threshold. We varied composition of the nanoparticles, their amount (the sputtered equivalent thickness was in the range from 1 to 50 nm) and also the geometry of sensing layers: geometry i) bottom AgPc + top nanoparticles, geometry ii) top AgPc layer + bottom nanoparticles. The sensors with geometry i) exhibited good recovery capabilities, those with geometry ii) seemed to better preserve phthalocyanine sensing properties. For the best combination, the AgPc(50 nm)/Au(10 nm) sensor, its dc-response rose to the value of 373 for 190 ppm of 2-nitrotoluene.

Energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) as a new type of energetic materials have attracted wide attention. However, regulating the energetic characters of ECPs and establishing the relationship between structure and energetic property remains great challenges. In this study, two isomorphic 2D π-stacked solvent-free coordination polymers, [M(N3)2(atrz)]n (M = Co 1, Cd 2; atrz = 4,4′-azo-1,2,4-triazole), were hydrothermally prepared and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. The two compounds exhibit reliable stabilities, remarkable positive enthalpies of formation, and prominent heats of detonation. The enthalpy of formation of 1 is 4.21 kJ·g-1, which is higher than those of all hitherto known primary explosives. Repulsive steric clashes between the sensitive azide ions in 1 and 2 influence the mechanical sensitivities deduced from the calculated noncovalent interaction domains.

The nitroaromatic analytes are strongly electron-deficient, whereas the conjugated polymer sensing materials are electron-rich. As a result, the photoexcitation of the CP is followed by electron transfer to the nitroaromatic analyte, resulting in a quenching of the light-emission from the conjugated polymer. The best CP in our studies was found to be poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-bithiophene] (F8T2). It is photostable, has a good absorption between 400 and 450 nm, and a strong and structured fluorescence around 550 nm. Our studies indicate up to 96% quenching of light-emission, accompanied by a marked decrease in the fluorescence lifetime, upon exposure of the films of F8T2 in ethyl cellulose to nitrobenzene (NB) and 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) vapors at room temperature.

Under optimized conditions, formed anionic adducts can be detected with higher sensitivities as compared with the deprotonated molecules. Fundamental aspects pertaining to the formation of anionic adducts of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), nitroglycerin (NG), and 1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazinane energetic (R-salt) compounds using various anions have been systematically studied by ESI-MS and ESI tandem mass spectrometry (collision-induced dissociation) experiments.

Interestingly, although the fluorescence quenching of the nanofibrous membranes is not linearly related to the exposure time, the fingerprint of each explosive at different times is very similar in shape, and the fingerprints of the three explosives show different shapes.

To reliably ignite nEMs with lower-power laser irradiation, light-sensitive materials could be added to the nEMs matrix. In this study, we investigated the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the combustion and explosion characteristics of laser irradiation-ignited nEMs. The threshold power and delay time of ignition gradually decreased with increases in the MWCNT contents of Al nanoparticle (NP)/CuO NP-based nEMs. The threshold power and delay time of MWCNT (10 wt%)/Al NP/CuO NP ignition were reduced to ∼40% and ∼50%, respectively, of those of MWCNT (0 wt%)/Al NP/CuO NP. This suggests that the MWCNTs act as effective optical igniters by absorbing irradiated laser beams and subsequently generating heat by the photo-thermal effect, promoting nEMs ignition. The optimal addition of ≤2 wt% MWCNTs in the nEMs matrix enhanced the pressurization rate, flame propagation speed, and pressure wave speed of nEMs because the MWCNTs rapidly transferred heat energy from nEMs combustion. However, adding excess MWCNTs suppressed the combustion and explosion characteristics of the Al NP/CuO NP-based nEMs matrix by heat dissipation and thermochemical interventions.

It was demonstrated that the sparingly soluble 2•Pt complex becomes water-soluble in the presence of all kinds of surfactants, viz., cationic (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB), anionic (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS), and neutral (e.g., Triton X-100). This may be due to the incorporation of its long lyophilic tail group (−C12H25) inside the micellar core, exposing planar Pt(II)C∧N∧N headgroup to the aqueous bulk phase. It was also observed that the extent of solubility of these Pt(II)-complexes in micellar media strongly depends on the length of the existing alkyl chain. For instance, the presence of longer dodecyl chain makes 2•Pt complex ca. 1000-fold more soluble than the complex 1•Pt, which contains a shorter propyl chain.

Herein, the selective etching of Al from ternary layered transition metal nitride Ti2AlN (MAX) and intercalation were achieved by immersing the powder in a mixture of potassium fluoride and hydrochloric acid. The multilayered Ti2NTx (T is the surface termination) obtained was sonicated in DMSO and centrifuged to obtain few-layered Ti2NTx. MXene formation was verified, and the material was completely characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, FESEM-EDS, TEM, STM, and AFM techniques. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of the synthesized Ti2NTx was investigated by fabricating paper, silicon, and glass-based SERS substrates.

We report 2D IR measurements of PETN thin films that resolve vibrational energy transfer and relaxation mechanisms. Ultrafast anisotropy measurements reveal a sub-500 fs reorientation of transition dipoles in thin films of vapor-deposited PETN that is absent in solution measurements, consistent with intermolecular energy transfer. The anisotropy is frequency dependent, suggesting spectrally heterogeneous vibrational relaxation. Cross peaks are observed in 2D IR spectra that resolve a specific energy transfer pathway with a 2 ps time scale. Transition dipole coupling calculations of the nitrate ester groups in the crystal lattice predict that the intermolecular couplings are as large or larger than the intramolecular couplings. The calculations match well with the experimental frequencies and the anisotropy, leading us to conclude that the observed cross peak is measuring energy transfer between two eigenstates that are extended over multiple PETN molecules. Measurements of the transition dipole strength indicate that these vibrational modes are coherently delocalized over at least 15-30 molecules.

The first two endothermic peaks correspond to the rhombic-cubic transition and the fusion of KP, respectively, the third indicates the fusion of KCl, while the exothermic peak is attributed to the decomposition of KP. The DSC curves obtained from LP showed four endothermic peaks and one exothermic peak. The first two endothermic peaks indicate the loss of adsorbed water and water of crystallization, while the third and fourth are associated with the fusion of LP and LiCl, respectively; the exothermic peak is due to the decomposition of LP.

The detection of organic compounds in the gas phase is particularly challenging due to the low concentration of adsorbed molecules on the surface of the SERS substrate. This is particularly the case for explosive materials, which typically have very low vapour pressures, limiting the use of SERS for their identification. In this work, silver nanocubes (AgNCs) were developed as a highly sensitive SERS substrate with very low limit-of-detection (LOD) for explosive materials down to the femtomolar (10-15 M) range. Unlike typical gold-based nanostructures, the AgNCs were found suitable for the detection of both aromatic and aliphatic explosives, enabling detection with high specificity at low concentration. SERS studies were first carried out using a model analyte, Rhodamine-6G (Rh-6G), as a probe molecule. The SERS enhancement factor was estimated as 8.71 × 1010 in this case.

A recently utilized ambient ionization technique, paper spray ionization (PSI), provides the possibility of combining sampling and ionization. However, an interesting phenomenon that occurs in generating negatively charged ions pose some challenges in applying PSI to explosives analysis. The goal of this work is to investigate the possible solutions for generating explosives ions in negative mode PSI. Methods: The analysis of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) was performed. Several solvent systems with different surface tensions and additives were compared to determine their effect on the ionization of explosives. The solvents tested include tert-butanol, isopropanol, methanol, and acetonitrile. The additives tested were carbon tetrachloride and ammonium nitrate. Results: Of the solvents tested, isopropanol yielded the best results. In addition, adding ammonium nitrate to the isopropanol enhanced the analyte signal. Experimentally determined limits of detection (LODs) as low as 0.06 ng for PETN, on paper, were observed with isopropanol and the addition of 0.4 mM ammonium nitrate as the spray solution. In addition, the explosive components of two plastic explosive samples, Composition 4 and Semtex, were successfully analyzed via surface sampling when using the developed method. Conclusions: The analysis of explosives using PSI-MS in negative ion mode was achieved. The addition of ammonium nitrate to isopropanol, in general, enhanced the analyte signal and yielded better ionization stability. Real-world explosive samples were analyzed, which demonstrates one of the potential applications of PSI-MS analysis. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-85029082384"

We utilized a three-dimensional close-packed PhC structure made of functionalized silica nanoparticles. They consist of alternating high and low refractive index regions and have optical properties, such as photonic band structures, that are very sensitive to the change of physical structures. This study used 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) to illustrate a detection method based on the transmissive photonic band edge shift (TPBES) due to the binding of TNT with amine anchored on particle surfaces to form Meisenheimer (amine-TNT) complexes. PhCs are exceptionally sensitive to a small change in refractive index caused by surface modification. As a result, they are suitable for sensing specific reactions between an amine and TNT. This method achieved a wide detection range of TNT concentrations from 10-12 to 10-4 M. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (DNT) and toluene were used as a control and blank, respectively. Because of gravitational sedimentation, the TNT-functionalized particles were self-assembled in pure ethanol. They were measured by UV-visible transmission spectroscopy. A three-dimensional model to simulate the detection system was built using the particles' center-to-center distance (a) and effective dielectric constant (ϵ) as a function of the TNT concentrations. Two sets of simulations were performed: the first set involved a parametric sweep of the center-to-center distance of TNT-functionalized crystals using ϵ = 2.015. The second set involved a parametric sweep of the dielectric constant with a = 263.1 nm.

In this work, we explored the possibility of utilizing a mass spectrometric method with statistical processing for PE analysis. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC × GC–MS) was implemented for the analysis of PE extracts. The resulting chromatographic peaks were aligned using mass spectra and retention time data. The aligned peaks were then subjected to statistical analysis using scores generated via principal component analysis (PCA), followed by a k nearest neighbor classification with Euclidean distance. Using appropriate data treatment steps, a 0% error rate and a 0% unidentified rate in the classification of PE to production lots was achieved in cross validation classification of training samples and classification of test samples.

An amino-aptamer with inherent affinity for TNT was mixed with TNT prior to covalent attachement onto a glassy carbon electrode surface which was modified with a nanocomposite of the type gold nanoparticle@fullerene (AuNP@C60). Electropolymerization of dopamine around the aptamer/TNT complex entraps the complex and retains the aptamer. After removal of TNT, it is assumed that the MIP cavity acts synergistically with the embedded aptamer to form a nanohybrid receptor (aptamer-molecular imprinting polymer). This results in recognition properties superior to that of aptamer alone. Benefiting from the double specific molecular recognition property of molecular imprinting polymers and aptamers along with the in situ generation of AuNP onto the surface of the modified GCE leads to superb sensing properties. Properties such as lower limit of detection (3.5 attomolar) and wider linear concentration range of TNT (0.01 femtomolar to 1.5 μmol L−1) are distinctly better than other reported methods.

In general, nanosecond-duration laser pulses on the order of 10-500 mJ, are used to generate a “weak” plasma, typically less than 10% electrons to other species ratio. Light emitted from this plasma is then collected, sent through a spectrometer, and imaged on to a CCD array. Based on the spectral lines detected and their relative intensities, the elemental composition of the material can be determined and quantified. LIBS is a versatile technique because it can be used on materials in all phases: solid, liquid, and gas. LIBS experiments are relatively easy to set up, robust, and can be used in the field with minimal or no sample preparation. Because of these advantages of LIBS compared to other analytical techniques, it has been widely employed in the defense sector, specifically in the detection of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) materials. The objective of this work is to investigate LIBS for characterization of emissions from explosive materials, in particular to detect the release of metal additives of aluminum, copper, mercury and lead into the surrounding air. A 10-Hz Nd:YAG laser is used as the source to generate the plasma. Solid propellant strands cured with predetermined quantities of trace metals are used as a source for the flame, and the plasma is generated using a tightly focused laser pulse. Initial analysis of plasma decay was conducted using solid test pieces of each of the elements or their compounds to be able to better understand the decay times of broadband background emissions compared to the specific spectral features corresponding to the species of interest.

Luminescence-based detection of explosive vapours with an organic semiconductor has attracted much interest because of its potential for detectors that have high sensitivity, compact form factor, simple operation and low-cost. Despite the abundance of literature on novel sensor materials systems there are relatively few mechanistic studies targeted towards vapour-based sensing. In this Perspective, we will review the progress that has been made in understanding the processes that control the real-time luminescence quenching of thin films by analyte vapours. These are the non-radiative quenching process by which the sensor exciton decays, the analyte-sensor intermolecular binding interaction, and the diffusion process for the analyte vapours in the film. We comment on the contributions of each of these processes towards the sensing response and, in particular, the relative roles of analyte diffusion and exciton diffusion. While the latter has been historically judged to be one of, if not the primary, causes for the high sensitivity of many conjugated polymers to nitrated vapours, recent evidence suggests that long exciton diffusion lengths are unnecessary. The implications of these results on the development of sensor materials for real-time detection are discussed. © 2017 the Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-85034602832"

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a nanotechnology that can be used to generate forensic information. This review aims to briefly explain principles of AFM and review potential forensic applications like age determination of bloodstains, fingermark examination, investigation of textile fibers, document forgery detection, gunshot and explosive residues analysis, and pressure sensitive adhesives investigation. Current techniques are highlighted and the usefulness of AFM is discussed. For the examination of gunshot, explosives and pressure sensitive adhesive residues AFM can determine elastic moduli, adhesion forces, energy dissipation, and dielectric properties of trace material, provide synoptic mapping of these characteristics and identify compositions. Phase imaging and force spectroscopy are important options but cannot unravel chemical identities. Forensic relevance of force spectroscopy for red blood cell age estimation is promising but remains to be fully explored. If not affected by surface roughness AFM height imaging may yield complementary information with respect to fingermark, textile and document examinations. For overlapping, (partially) erased marks or mixtures of biological traces phase imaging could provide composition information. If the chemical identity of trace components is important AFM may be combined with (surface/tip enhanced) Raman spectroscopy. Equipped with high resolution optical microscopy AFM(-Raman) technology may become a valuable forensic tool to characterize and understand trace transfer and persistence and to assess condition and age of evidence material.

The surface Lcys can be used as not only the stabilizer of the rQDs but also the primary amine provider which can react with TNT to form Meisenheimer complexes. Without any additional surface modification procedure, the fluorescence of rQDs equipped with Lcys was selectively quenched by TNT because electrons of the rQDs transferred to TNT molecules due to the formation of Meisenheimer complexes. Meanwhile, the embedded gQDs always remained constant. Upon exposure to increasing amounts of TNT, the fluorescence of rQDs could be gradually quenched and consequently the logarithm of the dual emission intensity ratios exhibited a good linear negative correlation with TNT concentration over a range of 10 nM–8 μM with a low detection limit of 3.3 nM. One can perform onsite visual determination of TNT with high resolution because the ratiometric fluorescence nanosensing system exhibited obvious fluorescence color changes.

This specificity is spoiled by natural and anthropogenic interference that can swamp the NQR signal. Fortunately, the spatial magnetic signature from the explosive differs significantly from that of interference and can be exploited to separate the signals. An array of coils, however, cannot provide truly independent measurements due to the inductive coupling between the coils. Single coil configurations can cancel out constant interference and retain the signal from an NQR coil, but the balance between arms of the coil is compromised by differential coupling to the environment.

The poor ultraviolet absorption and lack of an aromatic ring make peroxide-based explosives very hard to detect. As the signature compound of peroxide-based explosives, H2O2 vapor detection became more and more important. Rare-earth-doped vanadate is considered to be a suitable material for the detection of hydrogen peroxide due to the quenching of its fluorescence in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Its only drawback lies on its poor photostability. In this work, we have developed a new synthesis to limit the photobleaching of EuVO4-based films. We propose herein an original protocol using microwave-assisted sol–gel route. The photostability of luminescent EuVO4 has been achieved and the sensitivity has been greatly increased. The detection limit for H2O2 vapor is as low as 100 parts per billion (ppb). The characterization of these nanoparticles by photoelectron spectroscopy clearly correlates their sensitivity to H2O2 to the surface chemistry.

However, backlogs in many forensic laboratories resulting in part from time-consuming GC-MS and LC-MS techniques prevent prompt analytical information. Direct analysis in real time - mass spectrometry (DART-MS) is a promising analytical technique that can address this challenge in the forensic science community by permitting rapid trace analysis of energetic materials. Therefore, we have designed a qualitative analytical approach that utilizes novel sorbent-coated wire mesh and dynamic headspace concentration to permit the generation of information rich chemical attribute signatures (CAS) for trace energetic materials in smokeless powder with DART-MS. Sorbent-coated wire mesh improves the overall efficiency of capturing trace energetic materials in comparison to swabbing or vacuuming. Hodgdon Lil' Gun smokeless powder was used to optimize the dynamic headspace parameters. This method was compared to traditional GC-MS methods and validated using the NIST RM 8107 smokeless powder reference standard. Additives and energetic materials, notably nitroglycerin, were rapidly and efficiently captured by the Carbopack X wire mesh, followed by detection and identification using DART-MS. This approach has demonstrated the capability of generating comparable results with significantly reduced analysis time in comparison to GC-MS. All targeted components that can be detected by GC-MS were detected by DART-MS in less than a minute. Furthermore, DART-MS offers the advantage of detecting targeted analytes that are not amenable to GC-MS. The speed and efficiency associated with both the sample collection technique and DART-MS demonstrate an attractive and viable potential alternative to conventional techniques. © 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","2-s2.0-84992608951"

Under optimum sensing concentrations, the absorbance changes of AuNPs at 519 nm were linear with the concentration of nitroguanidine in the range of 15–55 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. The limit of detection of the colorimetric sensor was 1 μM based on the signal-to-noise of three, which has improved by as much as five orders of magnitude as compared with the traditional volumetric method and up to three orders of magnitude as compared with fluorescence approach as well. Moreover, as low as 15 μM of nitroguanidine can be visually detected by the naked eye without instrumentation.

The graphene surface was chemically modified using electron beam generated plasmas produced in oxygen or nitrogen containing backgrounds to introduce oxygen or nitrogen moieties. The use of this chemical modification route enabled enhancement of the electrochemical signal for TNT, with the oxygen treatment showing a more pronounced detection than the nitrogen treatment. For graphene modified with oxygen, the electrochemical response to TNT can be fit to a two-site Langmuir isotherm suggesting different sites on the graphene surface with different affinities for TNT. We estimate a limit of detection for TNT equal to 20 ppb based on the analytical standard S/N ratio of 3. In addition, this approach to sensor fabrication is inherently a high-throughput, high-volume process amenable to industrial applications.

Singly crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that it is a 3-dimensional metallo-organic framework. 1 exhibits strong emission intensity in dispersed acetonitrile at 430 nm when it is excited at 340 nm. Among different explosive and pollutant nitroaromatic compounds (epNACs), trinitrophenol (TNP) is able to quench emission intensity of 1 drastically making 1 as the turn-off chemosensor for TNP. Other epNACs, e.g. 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,6-dinitro toluene (2,6-DNT), nitrobenzene (NB), 1,3-dinitro benzene (1,3-DNB), 3,4-dinitrotoluene (3,4-DNT) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA) cannot quench the emission intensity of 1 significantly. The quenching constant value of 1 for TNP has been determined to be 7.16 × 104 M−1. Limit of detection of the complex towards TNP is 6 × 10−5 M. Resonance energy transfer (RET) is involved in the transfer of energy from the electronically excited donor, 1 to the acceptor, TNP thereby quenching the emission intensity. Some theoretical calculations have been performed to support the electronic transitions and the proposed mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85010850019"

In total, 31 TATP samples were synthesized with different raw material combinations and reaction conditions. For carbon, a good differentiation and a linear relationship were observed for acetone–TATP combinations. The extent of negative (δ13C) fractionation depended on the reaction yield. Limited enrichment was observed for the hydrogen isotope (δ2H) values of the TATP samples probably due to a constant exchange of hydrogen atoms in aqueous solution. For oxygen (δ18O), the small isotopic range and excess of water in hydrogen peroxide resulted in poor differentiation.

Thermal decomposition of PBXs was undertaken by applying simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate influence of the HMX amount on thermal behavior and its kinetics. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the thermal decomposition of PBXs based on mixture of HMX and TATB was occurred in a three-steps. The first step was mainly due to decomposition of HMX. The second step was ascribed due to decomposition of TATB, while the third step was occurred due to decomposition of the polymer matrices. The thermal decomposition % was increased with increasing HMX amount. The kinetics related to thermal decomposition were investigated under non-isothermal for a single heating rate measurement. The variation in the activation energy of PBXs based on mixture of HMX and TATB was observed with varying the HMX amount. The kinetics from the results of TGA data at various heating rates under non-isothermal conditions were also calculated by Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. The activation energies calculated by employing FWO method were very close to those obtained by KAS method.

A pulsed laser beam imaged through the soda lime glass mirror substrate converts the aluminum layer into a high-temperature high-pressure plasma which initiates chemical reactions in the overlying PETN sample. We had previously proposed [E.C. Fossum, et al., AIP Conf. Proc. 1426, 235 (2012)] to exploit differences in gaseous product chemical identities and molecular velocities to provide a chemically-based diagnostic for distinguishing between ""detonation-like"" and deflagration responses. Briefly: we expect in-vacuum detonations to produce hyperthermal (v ~ 10 km/s) thermodynamically-stable products such as N2, CO2, and H2O, and for deflagrations to produce mostly reaction intermediates, such as NO and NO2, with much slower molecular velocities-consistent with the expansion-quenched thermal decomposition of PETN. We observe primarily slow reaction intermediates (NO2, CH2NO3) at low laser pulse energies, the appearance of NO at intermediate laser pulse energies, and the appearance of hyperthemal CO/N2 at mass 28 amu at the highest laser pulse energies. However, these results are somewhat ambiguous, as the NO, NO2, and CH2NO3 intermediates persist and all species become hyperthermal at the higher laser pulse energies. Also, the purported CO/N2 signal at 28 amu may be contaminated by silicon ablated from the glass mirror substrate. We plan to mitigate these problems in future experiments by adopting the ""Buelow"" sample configuration which employs an intermediate foil barrier to shield the energetic material from the laser and the laser driven plasma [S.J.

A total of 15 defused military weapons including grenades, mines, rockets, submunitions, and mortars were examined. Swabs and wipes were used to collect trace (residual) amounts of explosives and their organic constituents from the defused military weapons and micrometer-size explosive particles were transferred using a vacuum suction-impact collection device (vacuum impactor) from wipe and swap samples to an impaction plate made of carbon. The particles deposited on the carbon plate were then characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy followed by DART-HRMS providing fingerprint signatures of orthogonal nature. The optical microscope of the micro-Raman spectrometer was first used to localize and characterize the explosive charge on the impaction plate which was then targeted for identification by DART-HRMS analysis in both the negative and positive modes. Raman spectra of the explosives TNT, RDX and PETN were acquired from micrometer size particles and characterized by the presence of their characteristic Raman bands obtained directly at the surface of the impaction plate nondestructively without further sample preparation. Negative mode DART-HRMS confirmed the types of charges contained in the weapons (mainly TNT, RDX, HMX, and PETN; either as individual components or as mixtures). These energetic compounds were mainly detected as deprotonated species [M–H]−, or as adduct [M + 35Cl]−, [M + 37Cl]−, or [M + NO3]− anions. Chloride adducts were promoted in the heated DART reagent gas by adding chloroform vapors to the helium stream using an “in-house” delivery method. When the polarity was switched to positive mode, DART-HRMS revealed a very complex distribution of polymeric binders (mainly polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols), plasticizers (e.g., dioctyl sebacate, tributyl phosphate), as well as wax-like compounds whose structural features could not be precisely assigned. In positive mode, compounds were identified either as protonated molecules or ammonium adduct species. These results clearly demonstrate the complementarity of micro-Raman microscopy combined with DART-MS. The former technique provides structural information on the type of explosives present at the surface of the sample, whereas the latter provides not only a confirmation of the nature of the explosive charge but also useful additional information regarding the nature of the complex organic matrix of binders, plasticizers, polymers, oils, and potentially other organic additives and contaminants present in the sample. Combining these two techniques provides a powerful tool for the screening, comprehensive characterization, and differentiation of particulate explosive samples for forensic sciences and homeland security applications.

The plasticizers tested were either inert, like dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dibutyl sebacate (DOS), and diisononyl adipate (DINA), or energetic like dinitro-toluene (DNT) and bis(2,2-dinitropropyl) formal/acetal (BDNPF/A). DSC results showed that all selected plasticizers were incompatible with CL-20, according to the STANAG 4147 standard. The thermal stability of CL-20 would be decreased in the presence of these plasticizers. Further measurements by the VST test revealed that the CL-20/DOP, CL-20/DOS, CL-20/DINA, CL-20/DNT, and CL-20/BDNPF/A mixtures were compatible with each other. The major reason for the differences between the results of the two techniques was ascribed to the applied temperatures. © 2017 by Begell House, Inc.","2-s2.0-85050387202"

The widespread use of improvised explosives and anti-personnel landmines have caused thousands of civilian casualties across the world. Current scenario of globalized civilization threat from terror drives the need to improve the performance and capabilities of standoff explosive trace detection devices to be able to anticipate the threat from a safe distance to prevent explosions and save human lives. In recent years, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging approach for material or elemental investigations. All the principle elements on the surface are detectable in a single measurement using LIBS and hence, a standoff LIBS based method has been used to remotely detect explosive traces from several to tens of metres distance. The most important component of LIBS based standoff explosive trace detection system is the telescope which enables remote identification of chemical constituents of the explosives. However, in a compact LIBS system where Cassegrain telescope serves the purpose of laser beam delivery and light collection, need a design optimization of the telescope system. This paper reports design optimization of a Cassegrain telescope to detect explosives remotely for LIBS system. A design optimization of Schmidt corrector plate was carried out for Nd:YAG laser. Effect of different design parameters was investigated to eliminate spherical aberration in the system. Effect of different laser wavelengths on the Schmidt corrector design was also investigated for the standoff LIBS system. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Here, a novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based chemiluminescence (CL) assay is described for the determination of TNT in environmental samples. ZnO quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using a simple and economical process and applied as efficient supports for the MIP layer. The MIP layer was produced using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as a monomer and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a cross-linker, in the presence of TNT as the template. The MIP-labeled ZnO QD composite (MIP@QDs) was characterized using photoluminescence emission, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The prepared composite showed a remarkable promoting effect on the weak chemiluminescence emission of an alkaline permanganate-rhodamine B (RB) system. This effect was described based on the catalytic activity of the composite. Moreover, in the presence of TNT, its molecules were adsorbed onto specific sites of the MIP and placed near the QDs, resulting in a noticeable decrease in the CL intensity of the KMnO4-RB-MIP@QDs system. Based on this effect, a selective and highly sensitive CL assay was introduced for the TNT determination. Under the optimal conditions, a linear relationship was obtained between the decreased CL intensity and TNT concentration in the ranges 0.02-50 and 50-200 ng mL-1 with a detection limit (3σ) of 6.8 pg mL-1.

The supramolecular host with an unusual crystal packing has been used for the detection of TNP. Fluorescence quenching through the RET-PET-ICT-ACQ mechanism results in a strong pi-pi interaction between the receptor and TNP. Both simulated and experimental FTIR spectroscopies have been performed to investigate the sensing event from solid phase perspective. The enhancement in enthalpy (ΔH) of the host-guest adduct suggests an endothermic reaction suitable for sensing a heat-sensitive explosive like the TNP molecule. On the other hand, entropy (ΔS) enhancement in the crystal formation suggests trapping or releasing of the solvent molecule. In reality, it is noticed from the SCXRD study that acetonitrile undergoes co-crystallization in the host-guest adduct. Ultimate energy (Efinal = Eadduct - Eprecursor) of adduct is lowered up to -919.89 Hartree, which favors the crystallization. The recognition event is highly selective for TNP, Cu2+, and F- among the other analytes, where TNP shows fluorescence turn-off and Cu2+ and F- show turn-on response at different spectroscopic energy levels. Indeed, the receptor proves to be a novel tritopic receptor for selective detection of cation, anion, and neutral analytes with a distinguishable signal.

The advantage of this method is the direct assembly of Glyc-AgNPs at the electrode surface without external modification.

The nanoparticles were further used for electrochemical sensing of 2,4,6-tri-nitro toluene (TNT) and di-nitro benzene (DNB), i.e. nitro-aromatic explosive compounds using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The Glyc-AgNP modified electrochip revealed significantly more sensitivity towards TNT as compared to DNB, as evident from the current intensity obtained due to the electrochemical reduction process. Earlier studies have suggested that tri-nitro compounds are more easily reduced as compared to mono- and di-nitro compounds, which is hypothesized as the main reason for the observed sensitivity for TNT.

PY-DNS undergoes aggregation induced emission in a poor solvent medium like water and has excellent fluorescence efficiency (Φ = 0.71). PY-DNS undergoes dynamic fluorescence quenching with TNP in sub-micromolar amounts, as observed from the increase in the life-time of PY-DNS from 0.73 ns to 1.45 ns in the presence of TNP.

In recent years, tremendous effort has been devoted to the development of luminescent materials for the detection of explosives in the vapor, solution, and solid states with a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity and a rapid response time. Apart from the wide range of organic fluorescent chemosensors, transition metal complexes play a prominent role in the sensing of nitroaromatic explosives owing to their rich photophysical characteristics. This review briefly summarizes the salient features of the design and preparation of transition metal (Zn(ii), Ir(iii), Pd(ii), Pt(ii), Re(i) and Ru(ii)) complexes/metallacycles/metallosupramolecules with emphasis on their photophysical properties, sensing behavior, mechanism of action, and the driving forces for detecting explosives and future prospects and challenges. Most of the probes that have been reported to date act as ""turn-off"" luminescent sensors because their emission (intensity, lifetime, and quantum yield) is eventually quenched upon sensing with nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) through photo-induced electron or energy transfer.

This high-energy molecule is challenging to detect because it lacks the characteristic –NO2 functional group that is the primary target of modern detection devices.

UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra with 228 nm excitation show signatures of the photodegradation products of HMTD. These photoproducts, including those of the isotopologues, are identified via mass spectrometry and vibrational analysis.

The polymer PFAM was well-characterized by means of NMR, UV-vis, fluorescence, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The amplified signal response exclusively for PA was achieved via a strong inner filter effect (IFE), a phenomenon different from the widely reported ground-state charge transfer and/or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based probes for nitroaromatics detection. Pendant amine groups attached on the side chains of PFAM provide enhanced sensitivity and exceptional selectivity via protonation assisted photoinduced electron transfer (PET) even in the presence of most common interfering nitroexplosives, as well as other analytes usually found in natural water.

Conjugated polymers are suitable probe materials for this application since their fluorescence is quenched by electronegative materials including explosives. This can be used to make a sensor for explosive vapour, which can then give chemical information to help identify explosive devices, and complements other approaches such as metal detectors and ground penetrating radar. Whilst the principle has been known for some time, its practical implementation requires considerable development of instrumentation and materials, including preconcentration materials.

With the introduction of In, the shape of the ZnO NPs changes from sphere with grain size of 55.2 ± 9.6 nm to irregular NPs with a reduced size. The sensing performances of sensors towards room-temperature saturated nitro-explosive vapors generally increase firstly and then decrease, peaking at an atomic ratio of 1.29% (corresponding to 5% In in the precursor). The 5% In-doped ZnO nanoparticle-based sensor exhibited remarkably enhanced responses towards trace nitro-explosive vapors, including TNT of 9 ppb, DNT of 411 ppb, PNT of 647 ppb, PA of 0.97 ppb and RDX of 4.9 ppt at room temperature. For instance, compared with ZnO, the responses to nitro-explosive vapors were increased from 22.2, 8.5, 2.9, 4.9 and 9.8% to 54.7, 52.9, 57.2, 58.3 and 47.4%, respectively.

Many measurements are carried out to elucidate the fundamental photophysical properties of an emissive material in solution. However, simple transfer of the understanding gained from the solution measurements to the solid-state can lead to errors. This is in part due to the absence of inter-molecular interactions of the chromophores in solution, which are present in the solid-state. To understand the role of inter-molecular interactions on the detection of explosive analytes we have chosen dendrimers from two different families, D1 and D2, which allow facile control of the inter-molecular interactions through the choice of dendrons and emissive chromophores. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy we find that the solution photoinduced absorption (PA) for both materials can be explained in terms of the generation of singlet excitons, which decay to the ground state, or intersystem cross (ISC) to form a triplet exciton. In neat films however, we observe different photophysical behaviours; first, ISC to the triplet state does not occur, and second, depending on the chromophore, charge transfer and charge separated states are formed. Furthermore, we find that when either dendrimer is interfaced with analyte vapour, the singlet state is strongly quenched, generating a charge transfer state that undergoes geminate recombination. © 2016 the Owner Societies.","2-s2.0-84988625147"

In this work, electron-rich of anthracene functionalized mesoporous aluminium organophosphonates (En-AlPs) were synthesized by a one-pot condensation process. The mesoporous structure and strong blue emission of En-AlPs were confirmed by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, transmission electron microscopy images and fluorescence spectra. The materials En-AlPs can serve as sensitive chemosensors for various electron deficient nitroderivatives, with the quenching constant and the detection limit up to 1.5×106 M-1 and 0.3 ppm in water solution.

Herein, we design a simple yet powerful optical sensing motif based on an electrodeposited luminescent MOF thin film of {[Eu2(TDC)3(CH3OH)2]·CH3OH} (Eu-TDC, where TDC is thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate). The parameters of the electrodeposition process were investigated and optimized. The phase and elemental composition of the Eu-TDC film were confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and its morphology and structure were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This thin film shows extremely good luminescence properties with characteristics of Eu3+ that are sensitized by the electron-rich ligands, which allows for high efficiency in electron-deficient nitroaromatic explosive sensing. Selective and sensitive responses to a series of nitroaromatic explosives were exhibited, especially for nitrophenols (TNP/DNP/4-NP, KSV > 104 M-1). It is also an efficient luminescent sensor for detecting nitrobenzene vapour. Significantly, this film can be easily recycled just by washing with methanol.

The DIOS is widely used in mass spectrometry due to the possibility of small molecule detection and high sensitivity. It is known that IMS based on laser ion source is a power method for the fast detection of ultralow concentration of organic molecules. However requirement of using high energy pulse ultraviolet laser increases weight and size of the device. The use of DIOS in an ion source of IMS could decrease energy pulse requirements and allows one to construct both compact and high sensitive device for analyzing gas and liquid probes.

The model compounds showed lower thermal stabilities relative to PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), but slightly improved mechanical sensitivities. The presence of electron-rich amine donors leads to a cathodic shift of the tetrazine redox potentials relative to those of previously reported tetrazine explosives. At these potentials, electron-rich tetrazines with either covalently bound or co-dissolved nitrate ester groups are irreversibly reduced. Effectively, changes in the electronic structure of tetrazines affect their electrochemical response to the presence of nitrate ester groups.

Here, we detail, through experiment and computational simulation, the interfacial contact between four common traps and five commonly investigated surfaces encountered in explosives detection applications associated with airport security. The Young's modulus and hardness of four traps and seven substrates were measured using nanoindentation. These properties determine how deformation occurs when traps are applied for contact sampling of explosives. The nanoindentation data were analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method, and an indenter area function was created using silicon and gold as the reference materials. The Young's moduli of the traps ranged from 0.2 to 8 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.5 to 4 GPa. The hardness values of the traps ranged from 0.005 to 0.22 GPa, while those of the surfaces ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 GPa. For each of 20 scenarios (4 traps, 5 surfaces), six contact simulations were performed. In these contact simulations, the Greenwood-Willliamson microcontact model was used to represent the behavior of the asperities on the traps, while the Timoshenko Beam model was used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the bulk trap materials spanning the space between asperities. This combination of feature- and trap-scale modeling provides a more realistic description of the interfacial contact than either model applied individually. The calculated distributions of separation distances between the traps and surfaces when the traps were contacted with the surfaces under a normal load were compared to estimate the relative effectiveness of the traps at interrogating the topography of the surfaces. This method is proposed as a tool to guide the development of trap materials for surface sampling and surface cleaning applications. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","2-s2.0-84961345096"

Cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images suggest a thickness of CNPs of around 0.9 μm on the SF scaffolds. Further, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis indicates multilayer adsorption of CNPs on the SF scaffolds. For sensing studies, carbon coated silk fibroin scaffolds are exposed to the vapours of TNP (SFCP) and TNT (SFCT) respectively followed by in-depth electrical analysis. Impedimetric analysis indicate changes in resistivity of the materials, following the order SF > SFC < SFCP, SFCT. The sensitivity of the biocomposite sensor has been investigated and found to increase by one order and two orders of magnitude when exposed to the vapours of TNP and TNT for 0-3 s, respectively. Further, the chemiresistive sensor is found to exhibit excellent reversibility, which is an important aspect from the point of view of recyclability of the sensor.

If materials are concealed behind thicker, coloured or opaque barriers it can be necessary to open and take a sample. Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS)[1] is a novel variant of Raman spectroscopy whereby multiple measurements at differing positions are used to separate the spectrum arising from the sub layers of a sample from the spectrum at the surface.

Many ordinary materials (paper, for example) are transparent to THz radiation while the hazardous substances, which have to detect, possess fingerprints in this frequency range. However, covers of ordinary material can distort its spectrum in such a way that the spectrum of reflected THz pulse or transmitted THz pulse will contain absorption frequencies, which are inherent to dangerous substance (explosives, illistic drugs.), despite their absence in the material under consideration. On the other hand, it is well-known that the spectrum of medium response under the action of THz pulse is broader than the incident THz pulse spectrum. This is a result of a possibility of high energy level excitation due to cascade mechanism of their excitation. For practical point of view, it is very important to know about features of a covering substance influence on the medium response spectrum broadening. This problem is investigated in our report using the computer simulation. We carry out computer simulation of a few-cycle electromagnetic pulse interaction with a substance exhibiting nonlinear non-instantaneous response. An influence of the pulse duration and polarization relaxation rate on the pulse interaction with an uncovered medium and with a medium, which is covered by a linear disordered structure, is investigated. We demonstrate that the spectra of reflected or transmitted pulses may comprise multiple additional spectral lines, caused by various transitions between energy levels of molecules. The spectral intensity of these energy level transitions is affected by the pulse duration and the effective time of interaction which depends on polarization relaxation rate as well as the medium layer thickness. © 2016 SPIE.","2-s2.0-85006990198"

For this purpose, we use a few examples. In the first example, we model the noisy THz signals transmitted through the amphetamine-type stimulant in real conditions. Namely, with a temperature 18° C, the relative humidity of about 50 % and the distance between the parabolic mirror and the object about of 3.5 meters. We show that the standard THz-TDS method reveals the spectral features of many neutral substances and explosives in the noisy THz signals from the illicit stimulant MA, at the same time this method is not able to detect the presence of this stimulant in the noisy signals. The second example is the detection and identification of plastids with inhomogeneous surface in reflection mode. We show that inhomogeneous surface distorts spectral characteristics of the reflected THz signal main pulse, which cannot be used for the detection and identification of the plastids by means of the THz TDS method. In the last example we show that even under laboratory conditions (at short distance from the receiver), THz TDS detects in the semiconductors the absorption frequencies, which belong to both hazardous and neutral substances. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose to use the time-dependent spectrum of the THz pulse, transmitted through or reflected from a substance.

When aggregates of the metallacycles were formed by adding hexane solutions in dichloromethane, aggregation-induced emission was observed for metallacycles 5 and 7, and aggregation-caused quenching was observed for metallacycles 6 and 8. The formation of aggregates was verified by dynamic light scattering and TEM analyses. Macrocycles 5 and 7 are white-light emitters in THF. Moreover, their high luminescence in both solution and the solid state was utilised for the recognition of nitroaromatic explosives. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The responses of the sensors fabricated by ZnS NCs with different Mn-doping levels (Mn:ZnS) toward the constituents, such as sulphur powder and black powder, generally increases first and then decreases with the increase of the concentration of doped Mn2+, and reaches the climate with an atomic ratio of 2.23% at room temperature. The sensory array based on eight sensors of Mn:ZnS NCs can realize the detection of two typical military explosives and six constituents relevant to IEDs within 7 s and can recover in 19 s. Furthermore, the fingerprinting of the constituents is achieved by pattern recognizing the inherent kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction between the sensory array and the constituents. Thus, a simple chemiresistive sensing strategy based on semiconductor NCs which can rapidly, supersensitively, and discriminatively detect the constituents relevant to IEDs is explored for the first time. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Just like nails hammered into a plate, the electrochemical shock with Al3+ ions and the following extraction with the help of oleic acid can disintegrate bulk TMD crystals into ultrafine TMD QDs.

Besides legal restrictions, radioactive materials have the disadvantage of a constant radiation with predetermined intensity. In this work, we replaced the 3H source of our previously described high-resolution ion mobility spectrometer with 75 mm drift tube length with a commercially available X-ray source. It is shown that the current configuration maintains the resolving power of R = 100 which was reported for the original setup containing a 3H source. The main advantage of an X-ray source is that the intensity of the radiation can be adjusted by varying its operating parameters, i.e., filament current and acceleration voltage. At the expense of reduced resolving power, the sensitivity of the setup can be increased by increasing the activity of the source. Therefore, the performance of the setup can be adjusted to the specific requirements of any application. To investigate the relation between operating parameters of the X-Ray source and the performance of the ion mobility spectrometer, parametric studies of filament current and acceleration voltage are performed and the influence on resolving power, peak height, and noise is analyzed. © 2016 Author(s).","2-s2.0-84971294678"

Counting the emitted electrons as a function of laser wavelength results in detailed spectral features, which can be used for material identification. The method has been applied to detection of trace explosives on a variety of surfaces. Detection was possible on dusty swabs spiked with explosives and also in the standard dry-transfer contamination procedure. Plastic explosives could also be detected. The analytical limits of detection (LODs) are in the sub pmole range, which indicates that MEES is one of the most sensitive detection methods for solid surface under ambient conditions. Scanning the surface with the laser allows for its imaging, such that explosives (as well as other materials) can be located.
